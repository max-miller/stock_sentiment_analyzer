    "Gathering full text from the new york times is a bit of a roundabout process. The NYT API is reasonably straightforward, but it won't give you the full text of the article. See below for an example of the JSON file you get from a query to the API: down at the bottom a 'meta' portion telling you how many hits there were for the particular query, and above, a 'docs' section with info for up to ten of the articles found. You only get a snippet, a lead paragraph and an abstract, though, not a full text (and some times, depending on what sort of article it is, the lead paragraph and the abstract can be very short - \"These were the key takeaways from the meeting\", or something like that)."

Tanner sits at a farmhouse table in a spacious home, wearing a tweed jacket and no tie, hair gray and a little shaggy, a patrician Everyboomer who could have walked out of a financial-planning ad. In November of ’75, he says, he was on the way home from a meeting with Jimmy Carter when a storm grounded his plane in Niagara Falls, N.Y. He called Carter from the motel. “He says, ‘Well, you just hit the jackpot,’\\u2009” Tanner recalls. “\\u2009‘Bob Dylan is doing this Rolling Thunder concert there tonight, and you can go.’\\u2009”',\n",

In an interview in The New York Times, Ms. Torres opened up about her character\\'s new chapter. \"What I love about the new show is that we actually get to go behind the scenes to see what in fact motivates Jessica,\" she said. \"She really is interested in using her very specific skill set for good.

       " ' (Reuters) - Netflix Inc said on Wednesday it lost U.S. streaming customers for the first time in eight years and missed targets for new subscribers overseas, an announcement that jarred investors ahead of looming competition.  Netflix shares sank nearly 12% in after-hours trading after the company posted quarterly results that showed it shed 130,000 U.S. customers from April to June. The world\\'s dominant subscription video service said its slate of new shows during the quarter was not as appealing as expected and price increases in some markets dented growth. Netflix reported that it added 2.83 million paid streaming subscribers outside the United States, below analyst expectations of 4.8 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Analysts had forecast a U.S. gain of 352,000. \"Our missed forecast was across all regions, but slightly more so in regions with price increases,\" the company said in a letter to shareholders. \"We think Q2\\'s content slate drove less growth in paid adds than we anticipated,\" it said. (For an interactive graphic, click here: https://tmsnrt.rs/2XPFdGg) Chief Executive Reed Hastings said on a video call with analysts the company\\'s internal projection still showed it expected to end 2019 with more new subscribers than it added in 2018. It currently boasts 151.6 million streaming customers worldwide. \"I think our position is excellent,\" he said. Netflix has staked its future on global expansion and creating original TV shows, movies and documentaries to attract new customers and keep the existing ones paying monthly subscription fees.  \"Even though we expected slowing user growth in the U.S., a negative paid net additions number is shocking,\" said Clement Thibault, analyst at financial markets platform Investing.com. \"The problem is that with intensifying competition, there is no guarantee Netflix has the pricing power needed to raise prices without massively bleeding users.\" Netflix raised prices in Britain, Switzerland, Greece and Western Europe during the second quarter. A Reuters/IPSOS poll in March found 81% of U.S. Netflix subscribers polled said they would cut the service if the monthly price rose by $5.  The last time Netflix lost U.S. subscribers was in 2011 following an uproar over a price hike and a plan to split its DVD-by-mail and streaming services. Looking ahead, Netflix projected it would add 7 million paid streaming customers in the third quarter with help from a new season of supernatural thriller \"Stranger Things,\" released on July 4. That is more bullish than the 6.6 million forecast from analysts polled by Refinitiv. But looming in November is the launch of Disney+, seen as a formidable entrant into the streaming market, and original programming from Apple Inc. AT&T Inc and Comcast Corp have said they plan their own offerings next year. Netflix also faces the future loss of its two most-streamed shows. \"The Office\" will come off Netflix in January 2021 and head to Comcast\\'s streaming platform, while \"Friends\" will end its run on Netflix at the beginning of 2020. It will move exclusively to the upcoming AT&T service HBO Max. Net income fell to $270.7 million (£217.7 million), or 60 cents per share, in the second quarter ended June 30 from 85 cents a year earlier. Total revenue rose to $4.92 billion from $3.91 billion.Analysts on average had expected revenue of $4.93 billion.

       " ' SAN FRANCISCO — Netflix\\'s video streaming service suffered a dramatic slowdown in growth during its traditionally sluggish spring season, a drop-off coming as the company boosts its prices and girds for even stiffer competition. The service picked up 2.7 million worldwide subscribers for the April-June period. That\\'s far below Netflix\\'s forecast of 5 million subscribers. The second-quarter letdown announced Wednesday comes after Netflix attracted nearly 10 million subscribers during the first three months of the year , more than any other quarter since the debut of its video streaming service 12 years ago. The slowdown rattled investors already wondering how Netflix might fare against a new wave of competition coming this fall when both Walt Disney Co. and Apple plan to launch their own video streaming services. After the second-quarter numbers came out, Netflix\\'s stock plunged 12% in extending trading. If that sell-off is replicated in Thursday\\'s regular trading session, it will be the largest decline in Netflix\\'s stock price in three years and wipe out $18 billion in shareholder wealth. Netflix ended June with 151.6 million worldwide subscribers, far more than a current crop of video streaming rivals that includes as Amazon and Hulu. Signaling it expects to regain some momentum this summer, the company projected it will add 7 million subscribers from July through September. The optimism stems in part from the immense popularity of \"Stranger Things,\" whose third season attracted record viewership after its July 4 release. But the battle for viewers\\' attention and dollars is about to get much tougher. Besides the Disney and Apple, AT&T will also join the fray next year with HBO Max and NBC is expanding into video streaming, too. \"I think our position is excellent,\" Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said during a Wednesday webcast. \"We\\'re building amazing capacity for content. Our product has never been in better shape.\" Netflix traced the second-quarter\\'s slow subscriber growth primarily to a recent round of prices increase, including hikes of 13% to 18% in its biggest market, in the U.S. That pushed the price of its most popular U.S. plan to $13 per month, testing the bounds of how much some consumers are willing to pay for a service that started out at $8 per month for the same level of service. Disney is already planning to undercut Netflix by charging just $7 per month for its new service . Some U.S. households decided Netflix is no longer worth it at the higher price, causing the company to end June with 120,000 fewer subscribers in the country than it had at the end of March. Hastings brushed off the disappointing second quarter as an aberration and predicted Netflix\\'s subscriber growth this year will surpass the 28.6 million customers who were added last year. But the increasingly crowded video streaming field has led to questions whether Netflix will be able to maintain the rapid rate of subscriber growth that has made its stock as one of Wall Street\\'s premier performers during the past decade. A $10,000 investment in Netflix at the end of 2009 would have been worth $460,000 at the end of Wednesday\\'s regular trading session. Netflix also needs more customers to help cover the costs of all the exclusive TV series and movies that it keeps adding to its line-up to stand out for the rest of the crowd. The Los Gatos, California, company so far has been borrowing heavily to finance a highly acclaimed slate of programming that garnered 117 Emmy nominations, second only to HBO\\'s 137 nominations among all networks. Selling ads would help Netflix bring in more revenue, but the company\\'s management on Wednesday reiterated the service will continue to remain commercial free. For now, Netflix is still burning through more cash than it is bringing in. In the second quarter, it registered a negative cash flow of $594 million and expects to accumulate a negative cash flow of $3.5 billion for the entire year. Part of that outgoing money will go toward the development of more original shows to replace some of the programming that it has been licensing from Disney, AT&T and NBC, all of which are reclaiming the rights for their own streaming services. The losses include \"Friends\" and \"The Office,\" long-defunct series that still remain among the most-watched shows on Netflix. But Netflix still posts profits due to the way entertainment companies are allowed to account for their programming costs. In the most recent quarter, Netflix earned nearly $271 million, a 30% drop from the same time last year. Revenue climbed 26% from last year to $4.9 billion.',\n",
       " ' Netflix, the streaming juggernaut that has upended the entertainment industry, showed signs of vulnerability Wednesday when it reported that it had lost 126,000 paid subscribers in the United States during the second quarter. It was the first time the company had shed domestic streaming customers since it started its digital service 12 years ago and its shares fell sharply. The number of those subscribers dropped during a time when the price for Netflix went up. In January, the company announced that it was raising its rates by anywhere from 13 to 18 percent, depending on the subscription plan, with the increases hitting existing subscribers in March. The second quarter is typically Netflix\\'s weakest time of year, but its performance this time was unusually poor. In its letter to shareholders on Wednesday, the company acknowledged that the higher subscription cost had something to do with its failure to meet second-quarter expectations. Netflix also noted that its second-quarter slate of programming, lacking fresh episodes of two of its original hits, \"The Crown\" and \"Stranger Things,\" was not as robust as it had been the previous quarter, which most likely figured in the disappointing results. In addition to losing domestic subscribers, Netflix significantly undershot the number of customers it had expected to sign up worldwide for the period. The company reported that it had added a total of 2.7 million subscribers for the three months ending in June, well short of the five million expected by investors and down from the 5.5. million it had brought aboard in the first quarter. Netflix stock fell more than 9 percent in early trading Thursday. Reed Hastings, the chief executive, brushed off the weak second-quarter performance. \"Our position is excellent,\" he said on a call with analysts after the release of the earnings report. Netflix forecast that it would add more than seven million subscribers in the current quarter, when the new season of \"Stranger Things\" was made available. The company, based in Los Gatos, Calif., tends to raise its prices around every 18 months. It decided on the latest increase at least partly because it burns a lot of cash, much of it borrowed, spending wildly on Hollywood talent and lavish promotional events. Netflix remains the nation\\'s largest internet television network, with over 60 million paying subscribers in the United States. The company has said it could ultimately bring in as many as 90 million total domestic customers. Globally, Netflix is most likely the largest streaming business, with more than 151 million subscribers. Its future growth will largely come outside the United States, with India representing its best opportunity. Netflix has given up on entering the Chinese market after difficulties with regulators there. The company\\'s dominance has prompted more established media giants to embark on streaming services of their own. AT&T, which acquired HBO and Turner Broadcasting as part of its $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner last year, announced plans this month for a streaming service — HBO Max — that will start next year. The Walt Disney Company will also go big on streaming, with plans to fill an expansive new streaming product, Disney Plus, with franchises like \"The Avengers\" and \"Star Wars.\" It will also offer the many television shows and films it picked up when it bought the bulk of Rupert Murdoch\\'s 21st Century Fox entertainment empire for $71.3 billion in a deal that closed in March. Adding to the competition, Apple is shifting away from its focus on hardware to spend more than $1 billion on Hollywood talent as it enters into the entertainment business with Apple TV Plus. That streaming service, with new content from a roster of talent that includes Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg and Reese Witherspoon, is scheduled for a fall debut. \"It\\'s not a zero-sum competition,\" Mr. Hastings said on Wednesday. \"People will subscribe to multiple shows. I\\'d wager that most Netflix employees are HBO subscribers.\" As part of its effort to ramp up its original offerings last year, Netflix signed Ryan Murphy, the prolific producer behind \"Glee\" and the anthology series \"American Crime Story,\" to a five-year deal said to be worth nearly $300 million. After wooing him away from 21st Century Fox, the company signed another name producer, Shonda Rhimes, the creator of ABC\\'s \"Grey\\'s Anatomy,\" giving her a nine-figure deal. Netflix released its second-quarter report a little more than a week after the news that it would lose the North American rights to \"Friends,\" the NBC sitcom that has had a highly remunerative afterlife in syndication and online. \"Friends\" was the second-most-watched show on Netflix in 2018, according to Nielsen, which is probably why the company was willing to pay as much as $100 million to stream the show worldwide in 2019. Starting next year, American and Canadian customers will be able to find it only on HBO Max, after AT&T exercised an option worth over $80 million a year for a five-year period. Netflix will still have rights to \"Friends\" internationally. Also beginning in 2020, Netflix\\'s North American subscribers will have to go elsewhere for \"The Office,\" another NBC show that has shown durability as a rerun. NBCUniversal, the show\\'s owner and another entrant into the streaming competition, grabbed the rights to stream it in North America after agreeing to pay $100 million a year for the next five years.',\n",
       " ' LOS ANGELES — \"Gossip Girl,\" the show that became a youth culture phenomenon with its trend-setting fashion and chronicling of the romantic lives of elite New York teens, is on its way back to television, this time in a new series for upcoming streaming service HBO Max. HBO Max, owned by WarnerMedia, said on Tuesday it had ordered a new, 10-episode series that will be set eight years after \"Gossip Girl\" ended its original run in 2012, and will follow a new generation of private school kids. There was no word on casting or whether any of the original stars, including Blake Lively, Penn Badgely, Chace Crawford and Leighton Meester, will return. HBO Max said the new series will explore how much social media and the landscape of New York itself has changed in recent years. \"Gossip Girl\" ran for six seasons on youth network CW becoming one of the most popular shows on television, winning 18 Teen Choice awards and inspiring fashion, hairstyles and beauty lines. The spinoff follows news last week that HBO Max will have exclusive streaming rights to 1990s TV series \"Friends\" - currently the second-most watched show on rival Netflix. HBO Max is expected to launch next spring with a combination of new original content and programming from networks HBO, TBS and classics from the Warner Bros. film library. It will join a string of other new streaming services including the upcoming Disney + and other digital subscription options as traditional media companies seek to attract online viewers.

       " ' \"Anima,\" the new solo album by Thom Yorke of Radiohead, has artistic tentacles. Its arrival coincides with a short film and within that, a dance — elusive, dreamlike and worthy of its leading man: a singer who knows how to move. The film\\'s choreography, set to three songs from \"Anima,\" begins normally enough as subway commuters collectively begin to nod off. Hands catch drooping heads in last-minute saves. Soon enough, their bodies form a collective as they execute an eerie, eccentric pattern of gestures, transforming them from humans into corporeal machinery.  Later, references flash by: to Buster Keaton, Mary Poppins, the film \"Metropolis.\" Yet this Netflix production is a love story with Mr. Yorke, its lithe oddball hero, in pursuit of a soulful, dark-haired woman he spotted on the train. (She is Dajana Roncione, an Italian actress and Mr. Yorke\\'s real-life partner.) When the commuters exit, she follows suit, leaving her lunchbox behind. With the off-kilter grace of Keaton, Mr. Yorke is on a mission: to retrieve the object, which hints at Mary Poppins\\'s carpetbag as well as her strange world of enchantment, and find her. \"It\\'s this idea of Alice following the rabbit,\" said Damien Jalet, the film\\'s choreographer. \"Or finding the loved one in this labyrinth.\" \"Anima\" is directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, but there is another, more understated, collaboration at work here: the one between choreographer and dancer. Mr. Yorke, who has long demonstrated an intuitive feel for movement, met Mr. Jalet, on the dance-heavy horror film \"Suspiria.\" (Mr. Yorke composed the score, Mr. Jalet was its choreographer.) Mr. Jalet said Mr. Yorke contacted him in December about taking part in a project that would be something more than a standard music video. \"I know that Thom loves dance as a language,\" Mr. Jalet said. \"I think we were looking for something that would be a bit awkward — in French, we say décalé, which is a bit off track.\" The result is a dystopian fairy tale, culminating in a pas de deux to the song \"Dawn Chorus,\" in which the faces and hands of Mr. Yorke and Ms. Roncione are distilled into a dreamy kaleidoscope. It\\'s a glimpse into a private world of reverie until, in the space of little more than a breath, Mr. York is left alone in the frame. Was it all a dream? Mr. Yorke has worked with the dance world before. With Radiohead, he composed half of the score for Merce Cunningham\\'s \"Split Sides\" (2003). (Sigur Ros created the other half.) And, memorably, in the 2011 video for the Radiohead song \"Lotus Flower\" he performed a solo choreographed by the British choreographer Wayne McGregor. That black-and-white video shows Mr. Yorke, gangly and loose, twitching his body to and against the beat as jittery shapes overtake his body. He has the predatory grace of a serpent. But \"Anima,\" which Mr. Jalet said was Mr. Yorke\\'s most extensive experience with dance, was a stretch. \"He had to work with a partner,\" Mr. Jalet said. \"And he had to fit within a group of people. It\\'s more than promoting the album — it\\'s something that will have a life of its own.\" One group scene element was inspired by \"Skid,\" a previous work by Mr. Jalet in which he explored gravity with a tilted platform. \"That was the thing I was the most nervous of because it\\'s a lot of counting and it\\'s quick,\" he said. \"To get used to the slope can be intimidating.\" But Mr. Yorke was more than game. \"It was incredible to see Thom learning all of this in two hours and just nailing it,\" Mr. Jalet said. \"And not only that, but being funny and awkward.\" Mr. Jalet, a prolific independent choreographer who has worked with numerous companies including Ballet C de la B, Chunky Move and Sasha Waltz and Guests, can deftly quote from his own catalog of dances and repurpose that material to create something new. Throughout the film, Mr. Jalet experiments with gravity and shifting perspectives. The opening train scene, set to \"Not the News,\" was inspired his memories of visiting Japan. \"The metro is safe there, and people are pretty overworked so when they go back home, there is this moment when they start falling asleep,\" he said. \"In Japan, nobody touches each other and then suddenly you start seeing people tilting. I\\'ve always felt it was such a beautiful physical manifestation of the unconscious.\" Such disconnection between the body and the head is somehow the key ingredient of \"Anima,\" the dance — letting go of the mind in order to succumb to a dream. The choreography\\'s final moments are ambiguous and surreal: Ms. Roncione and Mr. Yorke press foreheads. Slowly their hands drift apart. And it ends as it began: with Mr. Yorke nodding off.  \"It\\'s like it\\'s a cycle,\" Mr. Jalet said. \"It could all start back again from the moment he finds himself at the beginning in the train.\"',\n",

       " ' [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] He was one of the most notorious outlaws of the last 100 years: a brutal Mexican cartel leader, a wily trafficker who smuggled more than $12 billion worth of drugs and plunged his country into a long-running tragedy of bloodshed and corruption. But on Wednesday morning, the 30-year criminal career of Joaquín Guzmán Loera, known to the world as El Chapo, reached its final chapter as a federal judge in New York City sentenced him to life in prison. The life term, mandated by law as a result of the severity of Mr. Guzmán\\'s crimes, was handed down in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, where the kingpin was convicted last winter of drug, murder and money laundering charges after a sprawling three-month trial. [Related: El Chapo sentencing a \"Pyrrhic victory\" for Mexico.] As some of the federal agents who had chased him for years looked on from the gallery, Judge Brian M. Cogan issued the sentence and Mr. Guzmán, 62, was hauled away to prepare himself — pending an appeal — for spending the rest of his life behind bars. Before he disappeared into a holding cell behind the courtroom, he blew a kiss to his wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, who attended most of his trial and was implicated in a handful of his crimes. Although Judge Cogan had no choice but to sentence Mr. Guzmán to life, he noted that the \"overwhelming evil\" of the drug lord\\'s crimes was readily apparent. Beyond the life sentence — plus an additional 30 years — he ordered him to pay a staggering $12.6 billion in forfeiture. Looking disheveled and slightly out of sorts, Mr. Guzmán walked into the eighth-floor courtroom under guard shortly before 9:30 a.m. He wore a loosefitting gray suit, with his tie rakishly askew and a new-growth mustache darkening his upper lip.  Reading from a prepared statement, he said he had not received a fair trial and complained about his solitary confinement in Manhattan\\'s federal jail, calling it \"psychological, emotional and mental torture 24 hours a day.\" \"Since the government of the United States is going to send me to a prison where my name will never be heard again, I take advantage of this opportunity to say there was no justice here,\" he said. Though Judge Cogan did not specify where Mr. Guzmán would serve his sentence, he is likely to be sent to the country\\'s most forbidding federal prison, the United States Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility, or ADX, in Florence, Colo. Mr. Guzmán\\'s decades-long career atop the Sinaloa drug cartel, one of Mexico\\'s most powerful criminal mafias, came to a close only after years of joint investigation and pursuit by the American and Mexican authorities.  His ability to persistently evade capture — and then escape from prison after he was caught — underscored the deep corruption of the Mexican government by his cartel, which used bribery and intimidation to control not just the local, state and federal police, but some of the highest-ranking officials in the national government. \"It\\'s justice not only for the Mexican government, but for all of Guzmán\\'s victims in Mexico,\" said Raymond P. Donovan, the agent in charge of the New York office of the Drug Enforcement Administration, who was instrumental in capturing the kingpin twice.  After the sentencing, one of Mr. Guzmán\\'s lawyers, Jeffrey Lichtman, spoke outside the courthouse in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood, complaining, as his client had, that the lengthy legal proceeding had been unfair.  \"All he wanted was justice and at the end of the day, he didn\\'t get it,\" Mr. Lichtman said, adding, \"It was a show trial, and it\\'s been so since Day 1.\" Moments later, Richard P. Donoghue, the United States attorney in Brooklyn, whose office prosecuted the case with colleagues from Miami and Washington, also addressed reporters. Mr. Donoghue said the authorities could not undo the misery Mr. Guzmán had caused, \"but we can ensure that he spends every minute of every day of the rest of his life in prison.\" The trial took place under intense media scrutiny and tight security that involved bomb-sniffing dogs, police snipers and federal marshals with radiation sensors. The verdict on Feb. 12 came after more than a week of deliberations by the jury. Ultimately, Mr. Guzmán was found guilty on all 10 counts of the indictment. Prosecutors leveled some of the most serious charges possible against him, presenting evidence that he sent hundreds of tons of drugs to the United States from Mexico and caused the deaths of dozens of people to protect himself and his smuggling routes. The case revealed in exacting detail the inner workings of the Sinaloa drug cartel, such as how it employed I.T. consultants and how it packaged its cocaine in rubber \"condoms.\"  But given the defendant\\'s fame and notoriety, the trial was also a boisterous legal circus, complete with a horde of international reporters, a steady trickle of curious \"narco-tourists\" and a cameo appearance by an actor who plays the drug lord on a Netflix show. The American authorities began their hunt for the kingpin as far back as the early 1990s, when he was indicted on separate federal charges in Tucson and San Diego. The two indictments were filed just before and somewhat after he was arrested while on the run in Guatemala and then returned to Mexico, where he was tried and imprisoned for the 1993 murder of Juan Jesús Posadas Ocampo, a beloved Roman Catholic cardinal. In 2001, however, Mr. Guzmán broke out of prison — by many accounts, in the bottom of a laundry cart — and spent the next 13 years playing cat-and-mouse with the law. He evaded both arrest and the five subsequent indictments filed against him in the United States, largely by shuttling among a series of hide-outs in the Sierra Madre mountains in the Mexican state of Sinaloa. In February 2012, the Mexican and American authorities came within inches of nabbing him in an ocean-view mansion in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. But he was not caught until Mr. Donovan and a coalition of law enforcement and military officers on both sides of the border mounted a wiretap operation that cracked Mr. Guzmán\\'s communications network. He was found in a beachfront condominium in Mazatlán, Mexico, in February 2014. Within a year and a half, however, he had escaped again — this time, through a sophisticated tunnel that opened into the shower of his prison cell. A coalition similar to the one that caught him in 2014 redoubled its efforts and captured the kingpin for a second time, after a violent gunfight, in Los Mochis, Mexico, in early 2016. When Mr. Guzmán finally stood trial in New York in November, his conviction was all but assured given the mountains of evidence collected against him over the years. Some of that evidence came from incriminating intercepts from the various wiretaps over which agents had for months been listening in on the kingpin and his underlings. But just as damaging were the 14 witnesses from inside his cartel — suppliers, distributors, top lieutenants, even one of his mistresses — who testified against him. Since his extradition to the United States in January 2017, Mr. Guzmán has been held in 10 South, the maximum-security wing of the Manhattan federal jail. On Wednesday, he told Judge Cogan that since arriving there he had been forced to drink \"unsanitary water\" and wear earplugs made from toilet paper to drown out the racket of the ventilation system. In response, Gina Parlovecchio, a federal prosecutor, said it was ironic that Mr. Guzmán had complained about undignified treatment in jail given that he showed no respect to his countless victims, not just those he killed or hunted, but the thousands who were harmed by the drugs he \"pumped onto the streets,\" earning him a vast fortune of \"blood money.\" One of those victims, Andrea Velez, spoke out in court on Wednesday. She described through her tears how Mr. Guzmán had paid a Canadian chapter of the Hells Angels $1 million in a failed plot to murder her. Ms. Velez was at one point the personal assistant to one of the kingpin\\'s top lieutenants, Alex Cifuentes Villa, but eventually became an F.B.I. informant who spied on the drug lord and his allies. \"I\\'m a miracle of God,\" Ms. Velez said, \"because Mr. Guzmán tried to kill me.\"',\n",
       " ' SAN FRANCISCO — A wave of quarterly reports from Netflix and other top-tier, high-growth companies starting on Wednesday will test Wall Street\\'s willingness to extend a recent rally driven by expectations of lower interest rates. Facebook, Amazon and Google-owner Alphabet, all part of the so-called FANG group of widely held stocks, have jumped over 5% so far in July, with investors increasingly willing to bet on the volatile names thanks to expectations the Federal Reserve will cut rates later this month by as much as half a percentage point to support economic growth. The FANG companies, combined with investor favorites Apple and Microsoft, account for about 17% of the S&P 500\\'s $26 trillion market capitalization, making reaction to their quarterly results key to Wall Street sentiment. Netflix has been the FANG group\\'s poorest performer this month, up just 0.2% as investors worry that looming competition from Walt Disney Co in video streaming could limit its already cooling subscriber growth.  Still, the leading video entertainment company is up 2% since its weaker-than-expected quarterly report in April, and up 37% year to date.  The reports by Netflix, scheduled for after the bell on Wednesday, followed by Microsoft on Thursday, and Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet next week could fuel gains on Wall Street, or put an end to the market\\'s recent strength. \"The FANG stocks have done well because of overall market sentiment. But we\\'ve come a long way in a hurry, and a little bit like a baby, you\\'ve got to worry if there has to be a little burp,\" said John Brady, managing director at R.J. O\\'Brien & Associates in Chicago.  Netflix in April forecast weaker-than-expected growth in new subscriptions, and concerns since then have only increased following announcements that Netflix will lose its two most-watched shows in the United States - \"Friends\" and \"The Office\" - to upcoming rival services from AT&T Inc and NBC Universal in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Mark Stoeckle, senior portfolio manager at Adams Funds, said his Diversified Equity Fund is overweight Netflix due in part to its strong original content. The fund is underweight Facebook on expectations that the company has not fully recognized the regulatory challenges it faces, including in relation to its plan to launch a cryptocurrency, which has faced a backlash from governments and central bankers since it was unveiled last month.  \"Who at Facebook thought it would be a good idea to bring up this Libra cryptocurrency right now? The nicest way to say it is that it was ill-advised, given everything that\\'s on their plate,\" Stoeckle said.  Netflix predicted in April it would pick up a softer-than-expected 5 million new streaming subscribers in the June quarter. Analysts expect Netflix\\'s second-quarter revenue to rise 26% to $4.93 billion, while its net income is seen falling 34% to $255 million, according to Refinitiv. Earnings per share are is expected at 56 cents. \"Netflix is going to be interesting when it comes to guidance,\" said Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research in Chicago. \"They are going to have lot of competition, and I think they\\'re going to have to give us some guidance on whether they believe they can fight it off.\" Since 2002, Netflix\\'s second-quarter reports on average have been followed by a 5.9% decline in its stock the following day, according to Bespoke Investment Group. That compares to an average increase of 0.6% in the following trading day across all quarters for Netflix. Facebook is to post its results on July 24, followed by Amazon and Alphabet on July 25. Facebook and Alphabet face challenges including calls for increased regulation, while investors worry that Amazon\\'s race to expand one-day shipping will cut into its profits just as competitors including Walmart and Target improve their own online sales and deliveries. Year-to-date, Amazon has surged 35% and is less than 2% below its record high set last September.  Facebook has rallied 56% in 2019 and is 6% short of the record high it set a year ago, just before it warned of a multi-year squeeze on its business margins, sending its stock into months of decline as investors worried about fallout from the company\\'s mishandling of users\\' personal information. Even after their rallies this year, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon are trading at forward price/earnings multiples below their two-year averages.  Analysts expect Amazon\\'s quarterly revenue to grow by 18% to $62.4 billion, with non-GAAP net income growing 10% to $2.78 billion.  Facebook\\'s June-quarter revenue is seen jumping 25% to $16.3 billion, with net income up 6% to $5.4 billion. Analysts expect Alphabet\\'s quarterly revenue to climb 17% to $38.2 billion, with net income falling 4% to $7.9 billion.  Analysts expect Microsoft, the only U.S. company with a stock market value greater than $1 trillion, to post a 9% increase in quarterly revenue to $32.8 billion, with strong growth in cloud computing making that business larger than its Windows business for the first time ever.

       " ' LONDON — British broadband provider TalkTalk added 118,000 new customers to its fibre product in the three months to end June, helping it to reiterate its full-year earnings target. TalkTalk, which competes with BT, Sky and Virgin Media, said 70% of new consumer customers took fibre in the first quarter, driven by rising demand for video content on Netflix, Amazon and YouTube. That helped to also lift the average revenue TalkTalk gets from each user to 24.72 pounds from 24.65 pounds in the same quarter last year.  Total headline revenue grew 1.3% to 387 million pounds. \"This is all around the acceleration of fibre for customers, driven by increases in data, and principally that\\'s due to over the top video streaming,\" Chief Executive Tristia Harrison told Reuters. \"A fibre customer is a more profitable customer for us,\" she said. TalkTalk said its full-year 2020 guidance of strong EBITDA (core earnings) growth remains unchanged, underpinned by accelerated fibre penetration and its cost reduction plans. TalkTalk is building its own fibre-to-the-premise network in the northern city of York and three additional towns, but it has a more ambitious plan to build a network serving 3 million premises with an investment partner. Harrison said the firm was making good progress in finding a partner with advisor Lazards. \"We\\'re working with and talking to a whole range of the large infrastructure investors,\" she said. Shares in TalkTalk, down 7% so far this year, closed Tuesday at 105.7 pence, valuing the business at 1.22 billion pounds. They were trading up almost 1 percent after the market opened on Wednesday.

       " ' (Reuters) - Netflix Inc said on Wednesday it lost U.S. streaming customers for the first time in eight years and missed targets for new subscribers overseas, an announcement that jarred investors ahead of looming competition.  Netflix shares sank nearly 12% in after-hours trading after the company posted quarterly results that showed it shed 130,000 U.S. customers from April to June. The world\\'s dominant subscription video service said its slate of new shows during the quarter was not as appealing as expected and price increases in some markets dented growth. Netflix reported that it added 2.83 million paid streaming subscribers outside the United States, below analyst expectations of 4.8 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Analysts had forecast a U.S. gain of 352,000. \"Our missed forecast was across all regions, but slightly more so in regions with price increases,\" the company said in a letter to shareholders. \"We think Q2\\'s content slate drove less growth in paid adds than we anticipated,\" it said. (For an interactive graphic, click here: https://tmsnrt.rs/2XPFdGg) Chief Executive Reed Hastings said on a video call with analysts the company\\'s internal projection still showed it expected to end 2019 with more new subscribers than it added in 2018. It currently boasts 151.6 million streaming customers worldwide. \"I think our position is excellent,\" he said. Netflix has staked its future on global expansion and creating original TV shows, movies and documentaries to attract new customers and keep the existing ones paying monthly subscription fees.  \"Even though we expected slowing user growth in the U.S., a negative paid net additions number is shocking,\" said Clement Thibault, analyst at financial markets platform Investing.com. \"The problem is that with intensifying competition, there is no guarantee Netflix has the pricing power needed to raise prices without massively bleeding users.\" Netflix raised prices in Britain, Switzerland, Greece and Western Europe during the second quarter. A Reuters/IPSOS poll in March found 81% of U.S. Netflix subscribers polled said they would cut the service if the monthly price rose by $5.  The last time Netflix lost U.S. subscribers was in 2011 following an uproar over a price hike and a plan to split its DVD-by-mail and streaming services. Looking ahead, Netflix projected it would add 7 million paid streaming customers in the third quarter with help from a new season of supernatural thriller \"Stranger Things,\" released on July 4. That is more bullish than the 6.6 million forecast from analysts polled by Refinitiv. But looming in November is the launch of Disney+, seen as a formidable entrant into the streaming market, and original programming from Apple Inc. AT&T Inc and Comcast Corp have said they plan their own offerings next year. Netflix also faces the future loss of its two most-streamed shows. \"The Office\" will come off Netflix in January 2021 and head to Comcast\\'s streaming platform, while \"Friends\" will end its run on Netflix at the beginning of 2020. It will move exclusively to the upcoming AT&T service HBO Max. Net income fell to $270.7 million (£217.7 million), or 60 cents per share, in the second quarter ended June 30 from 85 cents a year earlier.

       " ' SAN FRANCISCO — Netflix\\'s video streaming service suffered a dramatic slowdown in growth during its traditionally sluggish spring season, a drop-off coming as the company boosts its prices and girds for even stiffer competition. The service picked up 2.7 million worldwide subscribers for the April-June period. That\\'s far below Netflix\\'s forecast of 5 million subscribers. The second-quarter letdown announced Wednesday comes after Netflix attracted nearly 10 million subscribers during the first three months of the year , more than any other quarter since the debut of its video streaming service 12 years ago. The slowdown rattled investors already wondering how Netflix might fare against a new wave of competition coming this fall when both Walt Disney Co. and Apple plan to launch their own video streaming services. After the second-quarter numbers came out, Netflix\\'s stock plunged 12% in extending trading. If that sell-off is replicated in Thursday\\'s regular trading session, it will be the largest decline in Netflix\\'s stock price in three years and wipe out $18 billion in shareholder wealth. Netflix ended June with 151.6 million worldwide subscribers, far more than a current crop of video streaming rivals that includes as Amazon and Hulu. Signaling it expects to regain some momentum this summer, the company projected it will add 7 million subscribers from July through September. The optimism stems in part from the immense popularity of \"Stranger Things,\" whose third season attracted record viewership after its July 4 release. But the battle for viewers\\' attention and dollars is about to get much tougher. Besides the Disney and Apple, AT&T will also join the fray next year with HBO Max and NBC is expanding into video streaming, too. \"I think our position is excellent,\" Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said during a Wednesday webcast. \"We\\'re building amazing capacity for content. Our product has never been in better shape.\" Netflix traced the second-quarter\\'s slow subscriber growth primarily to a recent round of prices increase, including hikes of 13% to 18% in its biggest market, in the U.S. That pushed the price of its most popular U.S. plan to $13 per month, testing the bounds of how much some consumers are willing to pay for a service that started out at $8 per month for the same level of service. Disney is already planning to undercut Netflix by charging just $7 per month for its new service . Some U.S. households decided Netflix is no longer worth it at the higher price, causing the company to end June with 120,000 fewer subscribers in the country than it had at the end of March. Hastings brushed off the disappointing second quarter as an aberration and predicted Netflix\\'s subscriber growth this year will surpass the 28.6 million customers who were added last year. But the increasingly crowded video streaming field has led to questions whether Netflix will be able to maintain the rapid rate of subscriber growth that has made its stock as one of Wall Street\\'s premier performers during the past decade. A $10,000 investment in Netflix at the end of 2009 would have been worth $460,000 at the end of Wednesday\\'s regular trading session. Netflix also needs more customers to help cover the costs of all the exclusive TV series and movies that it keeps adding to its line-up to stand out for the rest of the crowd. The Los Gatos, California, company so far has been borrowing heavily to finance a highly acclaimed slate of programming that garnered 117 Emmy nominations, second only to HBO\\'s 137 nominations among all networks. Selling ads would help Netflix bring in more revenue, but the company\\'s management on Wednesday reiterated the service will continue to remain commercial free. For now, Netflix is still burning through more cash than it is bringing in. In the second quarter, it registered a negative cash flow of $594 million and expects to accumulate a negative cash flow of $3.5 billion for the entire year. Part of that outgoing money will go toward the development of more original shows to replace some of the programming that it has been licensing from Disney, AT&T and NBC, all of which are reclaiming the rights for their own streaming services. The losses include \"Friends\" and \"The Office,\" long-defunct series that still remain among the most-watched shows on Netflix. But Netflix still posts profits due to the way entertainment companies are allowed to account for their programming costs. In the most recent quarter, Netflix earned nearly $271 million, a 30% drop from the same time last year. Revenue climbed 26% from last year to $4.9 billion.',\n",
       " ' LOS ANGELES — \"Gossip Girl,\" the show that became a youth culture phenomenon with its trend-setting fashion and chronicling of the romantic lives of elite New York teens, is on its way back to television, this time in a new series for upcoming streaming service HBO Max. HBO Max, owned by WarnerMedia, said on Tuesday it had ordered a new, 10-episode series that will be set eight years after \"Gossip Girl\" ended its original run in 2012, and will follow a new generation of private school kids. There was no word on casting or whether any of the original stars, including Blake Lively, Penn Badgely, Chace Crawford and Leighton Meester, will return. HBO Max said the new series will explore how much social media and the landscape of New York itself has changed in recent years. \"Gossip Girl\" ran for six seasons on youth network CW becoming one of the most popular shows on television, winning 18 Teen Choice awards and inspiring fashion, hairstyles and beauty lines. The spinoff follows news last week that HBO Max will have exclusive streaming rights to 1990s TV series \"Friends\" - currently the second-most watched show on rival Netflix. HBO Max is expected to launch next spring with a combination of new original content and programming from networks HBO, TBS and classics from the Warner Bros. film library. It will join a string of other new streaming services including the upcoming Disney + and other digital subscription options as traditional media companies seek to attract online viewers.

       " ' \"Anima,\" the new solo album by Thom Yorke of Radiohead, has artistic tentacles. Its arrival coincides with a short film and within that, a dance — elusive, dreamlike and worthy of its leading man: a singer who knows how to move. The film\\'s choreography, set to three songs from \"Anima,\" begins normally enough as subway commuters collectively begin to nod off. Hands catch drooping heads in last-minute saves. Soon enough, their bodies form a collective as they execute an eerie, eccentric pattern of gestures, transforming them from humans into corporeal machinery.  Later, references flash by: to Buster Keaton, Mary Poppins, the film \"Metropolis.\" Yet this Netflix production is a love story with Mr. Yorke, its lithe oddball hero, in pursuit of a soulful, dark-haired woman he spotted on the train. (She is Dajana Roncione, an Italian actress and Mr. Yorke\\'s real-life partner.) When the commuters exit, she follows suit, leaving her lunchbox behind. With the off-kilter grace of Keaton, Mr. Yorke is on a mission: to retrieve the object, which hints at Mary Poppins\\'s carpetbag as well as her strange world of enchantment, and find her. \"It\\'s this idea of Alice following the rabbit,\" said Damien Jalet, the film\\'s choreographer. \"Or finding the loved one in this labyrinth.\" \"Anima\" is directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, but there is another, more understated, collaboration at work here: the one between choreographer and dancer. Mr. Yorke, who has long demonstrated an intuitive feel for movement, met Mr. Jalet, on the dance-heavy horror film \"Suspiria.\" (Mr. Yorke composed the score, Mr. Jalet was its choreographer.) Mr. Jalet said Mr. Yorke contacted him in December about taking part in a project that would be something more than a standard music video. \"I know that Thom loves dance as a language,\" Mr. Jalet said. \"I think we were looking for something that would be a bit awkward — in French, we say décalé, which is a bit off track.\" The result is a dystopian fairy tale, culminating in a pas de deux to the song \"Dawn Chorus,\" in which the faces and hands of Mr. Yorke and Ms. Roncione are distilled into a dreamy kaleidoscope. It\\'s a glimpse into a private world of reverie until, in the space of little more than a breath, Mr. York is left alone in the frame. Was it all a dream? Mr. Yorke has worked with the dance world before. With Radiohead, he composed half of the score for Merce Cunningham\\'s \"Split Sides\" (2003). (Sigur Ros created the other half.) And, memorably, in the 2011 video for the Radiohead song \"Lotus Flower\" he performed a solo choreographed by the British choreographer Wayne McGregor. That black-and-white video shows Mr. Yorke, gangly and loose, twitching his body to and against the beat as jittery shapes overtake his body. He has the predatory grace of a serpent. But \"Anima,\" which Mr. Jalet said was Mr. Yorke\\'s most extensive experience with dance, was a stretch. \"He had to work with a partner,\" Mr. Jalet said. \"And he had to fit within a group of people. It\\'s more than promoting the album — it\\'s something that will have a life of its own.\" One group scene element was inspired by \"Skid,\" a previous work by Mr. Jalet in which he explored gravity with a tilted platform. \"That was the thing I was the most nervous of because it\\'s a lot of counting and it\\'s quick,\" he said. \"To get used to the slope can be intimidating.\" But Mr. Yorke was more than game. \"It was incredible to see Thom learning all of this in two hours and just nailing it,\" Mr. Jalet said. \"And not only that, but being funny and awkward.\" Mr. Jalet, a prolific independent choreographer who has worked with numerous companies including Ballet C de la B, Chunky Move and Sasha Waltz and Guests, can deftly quote from his own catalog of dances and repurpose that material to create something new. Throughout the film, Mr. Jalet experiments with gravity and shifting perspectives. The opening train scene, set to \"Not the News,\" was inspired his memories of visiting Japan. \"The metro is safe there, and people are pretty overworked so when they go back home, there is this moment when they start falling asleep,\" he said. \"In Japan, nobody touches each other and then suddenly you start seeing people tilting. I\\'ve always felt it was such a beautiful physical manifestation of the unconscious.\" Such disconnection between the body and the head is somehow the key ingredient of \"Anima,\" the dance — letting go of the mind in order to succumb to a dream. The choreography\\'s final moments are ambiguous and surreal: Ms. Roncione and Mr. Yorke press foreheads. Slowly their hands drift apart. And it ends as it began: with Mr. Yorke nodding off.  \"It\\'s like it\\'s a cycle,\" Mr. Jalet said. \"It could all start back again from the moment he finds himself at the beginning in the train.\"',\n",
       " ' Netflix, the streaming juggernaut that has upended the entertainment industry, showed signs of vulnerability Wednesday when it reported that it had lost 126,000 paid subscribers in the United States during the second quarter. It was the first time the company had shed domestic streaming customers since it started its digital service 12 years ago and its shares fell sharply. The number of those subscribers dropped during a time when the price for Netflix went up. In January, the company announced that it was raising its rates by anywhere from 13 to 18 percent, depending on the subscription plan, with the increases hitting existing subscribers in March. The second quarter is typically Netflix\\'s weakest time of year, but its performance this time was unusually poor. In its letter to shareholders on Wednesday, the company acknowledged that the higher subscription cost had something to do with its failure to meet second-quarter expectations. Netflix also noted that its second-quarter slate of programming, lacking fresh episodes of two of its original hits, \"The Crown\" and \"Stranger Things,\" was not as robust as it had been the previous quarter, which most likely figured in the disappointing results. In addition to losing domestic subscribers, Netflix significantly undershot the number of customers it had expected to sign up worldwide for the period. The company reported that it had added a total of 2.7 million subscribers for the three months ending in June, well short of the five million expected by investors and down from the 5.5. million it had brought aboard in the first quarter. Netflix stock fell more than 9 percent in early trading Thursday. Reed Hastings, the chief executive, brushed off the weak second-quarter performance. \"Our position is excellent,\" he said on a call with analysts after the release of the earnings report. Netflix forecast that it would add more than seven million subscribers in the current quarter, when the new season of \"Stranger Things\" was made available. The company, based in Los Gatos, Calif., tends to raise its prices around every 18 months. It decided on the latest increase at least partly because it burns a lot of cash, much of it borrowed, spending wildly on Hollywood talent and lavish promotional events. Netflix remains the nation\\'s largest internet television network, with over 60 million paying subscribers in the United States. The company has said it could ultimately bring in as many as 90 million total domestic customers. Globally, Netflix is most likely the largest streaming business, with more than 151 million subscribers. Its future growth will largely come outside the United States, with India representing its best opportunity. Netflix has given up on entering the Chinese market after difficulties with regulators there. The company\\'s dominance has prompted more established media giants to embark on streaming services of their own. AT&T, which acquired HBO and Turner Broadcasting as part of its $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner last year, announced plans this month for a streaming service — HBO Max — that will start next year. The Walt Disney Company will also go big on streaming, with plans to fill an expansive new streaming product, Disney Plus, with franchises like \"The Avengers\" and \"Star Wars.\" It will also offer the many television shows and films it picked up when it bought the bulk of Rupert Murdoch\\'s 21st Century Fox entertainment empire for $71.3 billion in a deal that closed in March. Adding to the competition, Apple is shifting away from its focus on hardware to spend more than $1 billion on Hollywood talent as it enters into the entertainment business with Apple TV Plus. That streaming service, with new content from a roster of talent that includes Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg and Reese Witherspoon, is scheduled for a fall debut. \"It\\'s not a zero-sum competition,\" Mr. Hastings said on Wednesday. \"People will subscribe to multiple shows. I\\'d wager that most Netflix employees are HBO subscribers.\" As part of its effort to ramp up its original offerings last year, Netflix signed Ryan Murphy, the prolific producer behind \"Glee\" and the anthology series \"American Crime Story,\" to a five-year deal said to be worth nearly $300 million. After wooing him away from 21st Century Fox, the company signed another name producer, Shonda Rhimes, the creator of ABC\\'s \"Grey\\'s Anatomy,\" giving her a nine-figure deal. Netflix released its second-quarter report a little more than a week after the news that it would lose the North American rights to \"Friends,\" the NBC sitcom that has had a highly remunerative afterlife in syndication and online. \"Friends\" was the second-most-watched show on Netflix in 2018, according to Nielsen, which is probably why the company was willing to pay as much as $100 million to stream the show worldwide in 2019. Starting next year, American and Canadian customers will be able to find it only on HBO Max, after AT&T exercised an option worth over $80 million a year for a five-year period. Netflix will still have rights to \"Friends\" internationally. Also beginning in 2020, Netflix\\'s North American subscribers will have to go elsewhere for \"The Office,\" another NBC show that has shown durability as a rerun. NBCUniversal, the show\\'s owner and another entrant into the streaming competition, grabbed the rights to stream it in North America after agreeing to pay $100 million a year for the next five years.',\n",

       " ' [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] He was one of the most notorious outlaws of the last 100 years: a brutal Mexican cartel leader, a wily trafficker who smuggled more than $12 billion worth of drugs and plunged his country into a long-running tragedy of bloodshed and corruption. But on Wednesday morning, the 30-year criminal career of Joaquín Guzmán Loera, known to the world as El Chapo, reached its final chapter as a federal judge in New York City sentenced him to life in prison. The life term, mandated by law as a result of the severity of Mr. Guzmán\\'s crimes, was handed down in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, where the kingpin was convicted last winter of drug, murder and money laundering charges after a sprawling three-month trial. [Related: El Chapo sentencing a \"Pyrrhic victory\" for Mexico.] As some of the federal agents who had chased him for years looked on from the gallery, Judge Brian M. Cogan issued the sentence and Mr. Guzmán, 62, was hauled away to prepare himself — pending an appeal — for spending the rest of his life behind bars. Before he disappeared into a holding cell behind the courtroom, he blew a kiss to his wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, who attended most of his trial and was implicated in a handful of his crimes. Although Judge Cogan had no choice but to sentence Mr. Guzmán to life, he noted that the \"overwhelming evil\" of the drug lord\\'s crimes was readily apparent. Beyond the life sentence — plus an additional 30 years — he ordered him to pay a staggering $12.6 billion in forfeiture. Looking disheveled and slightly out of sorts, Mr. Guzmán walked into the eighth-floor courtroom under guard shortly before 9:30 a.m. He wore a loosefitting gray suit, with his tie rakishly askew and a new-growth mustache darkening his upper lip.  Reading from a prepared statement, he said he had not received a fair trial and complained about his solitary confinement in Manhattan\\'s federal jail, calling it \"psychological, emotional and mental torture 24 hours a day.\" \"Since the government of the United States is going to send me to a prison where my name will never be heard again, I take advantage of this opportunity to say there was no justice here,\" he said. Though Judge Cogan did not specify where Mr. Guzmán would serve his sentence, he is likely to be sent to the country\\'s most forbidding federal prison, the United States Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility, or ADX, in Florence, Colo. Mr. Guzmán\\'s decades-long career atop the Sinaloa drug cartel, one of Mexico\\'s most powerful criminal mafias, came to a close only after years of joint investigation and pursuit by the American and Mexican authorities.  His ability to persistently evade capture — and then escape from prison after he was caught — underscored the deep corruption of the Mexican government by his cartel, which used bribery and intimidation to control not just the local, state and federal police, but some of the highest-ranking officials in the national government. \"It\\'s justice not only for the Mexican government, but for all of Guzmán\\'s victims in Mexico,\" said Raymond P. Donovan, the agent in charge of the New York office of the Drug Enforcement Administration, who was instrumental in capturing the kingpin twice.  After the sentencing, one of Mr. Guzmán\\'s lawyers, Jeffrey Lichtman, spoke outside the courthouse in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood, complaining, as his client had, that the lengthy legal proceeding had been unfair.  \"All he wanted was justice and at the end of the day, he didn\\'t get it,\" Mr. Lichtman said, adding, \"It was a show trial, and it\\'s been so since Day 1.\" Moments later, Richard P. Donoghue, the United States attorney in Brooklyn, whose office prosecuted the case with colleagues from Miami and Washington, also addressed reporters. Mr. Donoghue said the authorities could not undo the misery Mr. Guzmán had caused, \"but we can ensure that he spends every minute of every day of the rest of his life in prison.\" The trial took place under intense media scrutiny and tight security that involved bomb-sniffing dogs, police snipers and federal marshals with radiation sensors. The verdict on Feb. 12 came after more than a week of deliberations by the jury. Ultimately, Mr. Guzmán was found guilty on all 10 counts of the indictment. Prosecutors leveled some of the most serious charges possible against him, presenting evidence that he sent hundreds of tons of drugs to the United States from Mexico and caused the deaths of dozens of people to protect himself and his smuggling routes. The case revealed in exacting detail the inner workings of the Sinaloa drug cartel, such as how it employed I.T. consultants and how it packaged its cocaine in rubber \"condoms.\"  But given the defendant\\'s fame and notoriety, the trial was also a boisterous legal circus, complete with a horde of international reporters, a steady trickle of curious \"narco-tourists\" and a cameo appearance by an actor who plays the drug lord on a Netflix show. The American authorities began their hunt for the kingpin as far back as the early 1990s, when he was indicted on separate federal charges in Tucson and San Diego. The two indictments were filed just before and somewhat after he was arrested while on the run in Guatemala and then returned to Mexico, where he was tried and imprisoned for the 1993 murder of Juan Jesús Posadas Ocampo, a beloved Roman Catholic cardinal. In 2001, however, Mr. Guzmán broke out of prison — by many accounts, in the bottom of a laundry cart — and spent the next 13 years playing cat-and-mouse with the law. He evaded both arrest and the five subsequent indictments filed against him in the United States, largely by shuttling among a series of hide-outs in the Sierra Madre mountains in the Mexican state of Sinaloa. In February 2012, the Mexican and American authorities came within inches of nabbing him in an ocean-view mansion in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. But he was not caught until Mr. Donovan and a coalition of law enforcement and military officers on both sides of the border mounted a wiretap operation that cracked Mr. Guzmán\\'s communications network. He was found in a beachfront condominium in Mazatlán, Mexico, in February 2014. Within a year and a half, however, he had escaped again — this time, through a sophisticated tunnel that opened into the shower of his prison cell. A coalition similar to the one that caught him in 2014 redoubled its efforts and captured the kingpin for a second time, after a violent gunfight, in Los Mochis, Mexico, in early 2016. When Mr. Guzmán finally stood trial in New York in November, his conviction was all but assured given the mountains of evidence collected against him over the years. Some of that evidence came from incriminating intercepts from the various wiretaps over which agents had for months been listening in on the kingpin and his underlings. But just as damaging were the 14 witnesses from inside his cartel — suppliers, distributors, top lieutenants, even one of his mistresses — who testified against him. Since his extradition to the United States in January 2017, Mr. Guzmán has been held in 10 South, the maximum-security wing of the Manhattan federal jail. On Wednesday, he told Judge Cogan that since arriving there he had been forced to drink \"unsanitary water\" and wear earplugs made from toilet paper to drown out the racket of the ventilation system. In response, Gina Parlovecchio, a federal prosecutor, said it was ironic that Mr. Guzmán had complained about undignified treatment in jail given that he showed no respect to his countless victims, not just those he killed or hunted, but the thousands who were harmed by the drugs he \"pumped onto the streets,\" earning him a vast fortune of \"blood money.\" One of those victims, Andrea Velez, spoke out in court on Wednesday. She described through her tears how Mr. Guzmán had paid a Canadian chapter of the Hells Angels $1 million in a failed plot to murder her. Ms. Velez was at one point the personal assistant to one of the kingpin\\'s top lieutenants, Alex Cifuentes Villa, but eventually became an F.B.I. informant who spied on the drug lord and his allies. \"I\\'m a miracle of God,\" Ms. Velez said, \"because Mr. Guzmán tried to kill me.\"',\n",
       " ' SAN FRANCISCO — A wave of quarterly reports from Netflix and other top-tier, high-growth companies starting on Wednesday will test Wall Street\\'s willingness to extend a recent rally driven by expectations of lower interest rates. Facebook, Amazon and Google-owner Alphabet, all part of the so-called FANG group of widely held stocks, have jumped over 5% so far in July, with investors increasingly willing to bet on the volatile names thanks to expectations the Federal Reserve will cut rates later this month by as much as half a percentage point to support economic growth. The FANG companies, combined with investor favorites Apple and Microsoft, account for about 17% of the S&P 500\\'s $26 trillion market capitalization, making reaction to their quarterly results key to Wall Street sentiment. Netflix has been the FANG group\\'s poorest performer this month, up just 0.2% as investors worry that looming competition from Walt Disney Co in video streaming could limit its already cooling subscriber growth.  Still, the leading video entertainment company is up 2% since its weaker-than-expected quarterly report in April, and up 37% year to date.  The reports by Netflix, scheduled for after the bell on Wednesday, followed by Microsoft on Thursday, and Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet next week could fuel gains on Wall Street, or put an end to the market\\'s recent strength. \"The FANG stocks have done well because of overall market sentiment. But we\\'ve come a long way in a hurry, and a little bit like a baby, you\\'ve got to worry if there has to be a little burp,\" said John Brady, managing director at R.J. O\\'Brien & Associates in Chicago.  Netflix in April forecast weaker-than-expected growth in new subscriptions, and concerns since then have only increased following announcements that Netflix will lose its two most-watched shows in the United States - \"Friends\" and \"The Office\" - to upcoming rival services from AT&T Inc and NBC Universal in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Mark Stoeckle, senior portfolio manager at Adams Funds, said his Diversified Equity Fund is overweight Netflix due in part to its strong original content. The fund is underweight Facebook on expectations that the company has not fully recognized the regulatory challenges it faces, including in relation to its plan to launch a cryptocurrency, which has faced a backlash from governments and central bankers since it was unveiled last month.  \"Who at Facebook thought it would be a good idea to bring up this Libra cryptocurrency right now? The nicest way to say it is that it was ill-advised, given everything that\\'s on their plate,\" Stoeckle said.  Netflix predicted in April it would pick up a softer-than-expected 5 million new streaming subscribers in the June quarter. Analysts expect Netflix\\'s second-quarter revenue to rise 26% to $4.93 billion, while its net income is seen falling 34% to $255 million, according to Refinitiv. Earnings per share are is expected at 56 cents. \"Netflix is going to be interesting when it comes to guidance,\" said Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research in Chicago. \"They are going to have lot of competition, and I think they\\'re going to have to give us some guidance on whether they believe they can fight it off.\" Since 2002, Netflix\\'s second-quarter reports on average have been followed by a 5.9% decline in its stock the following day, according to Bespoke Investment Group. That compares to an average increase of 0.6% in the following trading day across all quarters for Netflix. Facebook is to post its results on July 24, followed by Amazon and Alphabet on July 25. Facebook and Alphabet face challenges including calls for increased regulation, while investors worry that Amazon\\'s race to expand one-day shipping will cut into its profits just as competitors including Walmart and Target improve their own online sales and deliveries. Year-to-date, Amazon has surged 35% and is less than 2% below its record high set last September.  Facebook has rallied 56% in 2019 and is 6% short of the record high it set a year ago, just before it warned of a multi-year squeeze on its business margins, sending its stock into months of decline as investors worried about fallout from the company\\'s mishandling of users\\' personal information. Even after their rallies this year, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon are trading at forward price/earnings multiples below their two-year averages.  Analysts expect Amazon\\'s quarterly revenue to grow by 18% to $62.4 billion, with non-GAAP net income growing 10% to $2.78 billion.  Facebook\\'s June-quarter revenue is seen jumping 25% to $16.3 billion, with net income up 6% to $5.4 billion. Analysts expect Alphabet\\'s quarterly revenue to climb 17% to $38.2 billion, with net income falling 4% to $7.9 billion.  Analysts expect Microsoft, the only U.S. company with a stock market value greater than $1 trillion, to post a 9% increase in quarterly revenue to $32.8 billion, with strong growth in cloud computing making that business larger than its Windows business for the first time ever.

       " ' LONDON — British broadband provider TalkTalk added 118,000 new customers to its fibre product in the three months to end June, helping it to reiterate its full-year earnings target. TalkTalk, which competes with BT, Sky and Virgin Media, said 70% of new consumer customers took fibre in the first quarter, driven by rising demand for video content on Netflix, Amazon and YouTube. That helped to also lift the average revenue TalkTalk gets from each user to 24.72 pounds from 24.65 pounds in the same quarter last year.  Total headline revenue grew 1.3% to 387 million pounds. \"This is all around the acceleration of fibre for customers, driven by increases in data, and principally that\\'s due to over the top video streaming,\" Chief Executive Tristia Harrison told Reuters. \"A fibre customer is a more profitable customer for us,\" she said. TalkTalk said its full-year 2020 guidance of strong EBITDA (core earnings) growth remains unchanged, underpinned by accelerated fibre penetration and its cost reduction plans. TalkTalk is building its own fibre-to-the-premise network in the northern city of York and three additional towns, but it has a more ambitious plan to build a network serving 3 million premises with an investment partner. Harrison said the firm was making good progress in finding a partner with advisor Lazards. \"We\\'re working with and talking to a whole range of the large infrastructure investors,\" she said. Shares in TalkTalk, down 7% so far this year, closed Tuesday at 105.7 pence, valuing the business at 1.22 billion pounds. They were trading up almost 1 percent after the market opened on Wednesday.

       " ' (Reuters) - Netflix Inc said on Wednesday it would roll out a lower-priced mobile-only plan in India, tapping into a price-sensitive market where data consumption on smartphones is surging. The video streaming pioneer said in March that it was testing a 250 rupee (£3) monthly subscription for mobile devices in India, where data plans are among the cheapest in the world. \"We believe this plan ... will be an effective way to introduce a larger number of people in India to Netflix and to further expand our business in a market where Pay TV ARPU is low,\" the company said. Netflix\\'s new plan is aimed at battling cheaper offerings from rivals such as Amazon.com Inc\\'s Prime Video and Hotstar, a video streaming platform owned by Walt Disney Co\\'s India unit. Netflix currently offers three monthly plans in India, priced between 500 rupees and 800 rupees.  In contrast, Hotstar, which also offers content from AT&T Inc\\'s HBO and streams live sports, charges 299 rupees per month. Amazon bundles its video and music streaming services with its Prime membership.  Netflix\\'s announcement was part of its quarterly results, in which it reported lower-than-expected subscriber additions. India figures prominently in Netflix Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings\\' global expansion plans. The company is investing heavily in creating blockbuster shows such as crime thriller \"Sacred Games\" and \"Delhi Crime\" with A-list Bollywood actors. The second season of \"Sacred Games\" is set to release in August. \"We\\'ve been seeing nice steady increases in engagement with our Indian viewers that we think we can keep building on. Growth in that country is a marathon, so we\\'re in it for the long haul,\" Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said.

       " ' The yearlong Ebola epidemic, which has killed 1,676 people and infected 2,512, is the second-largest outbreak in history (after the one in West Africa in 2014 and 2015, which killed 11,310 people and infected 28,616 others). The World Health Organization issued a global health emergency declaration on Wednesday, on the recommendation of an expert panel that had considered and rejected the move three times in recent months. The delay had drawn sharp criticism from public health specialists. Significance: The W.H.O. reserves the declaration of a global emergency for outbreaks that pose a serious threat to public health and could spread to other countries. The order is meant to increase international attention and garner aid to help stop epidemics. Urgency: The W.H.O. said it had received $49 million from international donors from February to July, only half the money it needs. Officials who have visited the region say supplies are running short, including protective gear for health workers, syringes and gloves. As tensions between Tehran and Washington have escalated in recent months, the fates of foreign prisoners held in Iran — which American officials believe are used as political pawns — have become increasingly complicated. At least four American citizens are known to be held in Iran. A British-Iranian woman who has been detained in Tehran since 2016 was recently moved to a hospital psychiatric unit, her family said. And, most recently, a French-Iranian scholar was arrested without explanation, officials said on Monday. For their part, Iranian officials have said that more than a dozen Iranians are being held by the U.S., often on charges of violating American sanctions. What\\'s next? While each case is different, it\\'s unclear what might happen to the prisoners stuck in Iran\\'s opaque judiciary system. Their families say they receive dribs and drabs of information, if any at all, about their cases.  Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, the founder of the group behind the deadly 2008 attacks in Mumbai, India, is in custody. The question is for how long, since he has been arrested and released before.  Mr. Saeed is charged with financing terrorism following investigations into two charities that prosecutors said acted as fronts for Lashkar-e-Taiba, the group that he founded.  Context: Pakistan has long been criticized for sheltering wanted terrorists, and last year an international terrorism-financing watchdog threatened to blacklist the country if it didn\\'t crack down on militant groups and leaders — an outcome the new prime minister, Imran Khan, said the weakened economy \"can\\'t afford.\" What\\'s next: Mr. Saeed\\'s arrest comes days before Mr. Khan is scheduled to meet with President Trump in Washington, when the prime minister will try to present a reformed image of Pakistan. The discussions will also likely touch on the ongoing Afghan peace negotiations. It has been three months since a fire ravaged the more-than-850-year-old landmark in Paris. The Times conducted scores of interviews and reviewed hundreds of documents to reconstruct how it was saved. What became clear was how close the cathedral — one of the world\\'s most recognizable buildings — came to collapsing, and how a small group of firefighters prevented it. Here are more takeaways from our investigation. What happened: A guard who responded to the fire went to the wrong building and found nothing. By the time he and a fire security company employee realized the mistake, the fire had been burning for more than 30 minutes.  Fighting the fire: Disadvantaged by their late start, firefighters rushed up the 300 steps to the attic, only to be forced to retreat. Finally, a small group was sent directly into the flames in a desperate effort to save the cathedral. What\\'s next: Bitter finger-pointing continues over who was responsible for allowing the blaze to rage unchecked for so long. The questions are at the heart of a long investigation by the French authorities. The nearly 18-year war in Afghanistan has taken a heavy toll on Afghan troops and police officers, 45,000 of whom have been killed in the past five years.  As the Taliban and the U.S. try to reach an agreement to withdraw Western troops, The Times talked to Afghan security forces, who spoke frankly about their leaders, the Taliban, the prospects for peace and the loss of comrades and loved ones. Netflix: The streaming giant said it added just 2.7 million subscribers in the second quarter, far short of the 5 million investors had expected, and lost 130,000 domestic customers during the period.

       " ' [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] He was one of the most notorious outlaws of the last 100 years: a brutal Mexican cartel leader, a wily trafficker who smuggled more than $12 billion worth of drugs and plunged his country into a long-running tragedy of bloodshed and corruption. But on Wednesday morning, the 30-year criminal career of Joaquín Guzmán Loera, known to the world as El Chapo, reached its final chapter as a federal judge in New York City sentenced him to life in prison. The life term, mandated by law as a result of the severity of Mr. Guzmán\\'s crimes, was handed down in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, where the kingpin was convicted last winter of drug, murder and money laundering charges after a sprawling three-month trial. [Related: El Chapo sentencing a \"Pyrrhic victory\" for Mexico.] As some of the federal agents who had chased him for years looked on from the gallery, Judge Brian M. Cogan issued the sentence and Mr. Guzmán, 62, was hauled away to prepare himself — pending an appeal — for spending the rest of his life behind bars. Before he disappeared into a holding cell behind the courtroom, he blew a kiss to his wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, who attended most of his trial and was implicated in a handful of his crimes. Although Judge Cogan had no choice but to sentence Mr. Guzmán to life, he noted that the \"overwhelming evil\" of the drug lord\\'s crimes was readily apparent. Beyond the life sentence — plus an additional 30 years — he ordered him to pay a staggering $12.6 billion in forfeiture. Looking disheveled and slightly out of sorts, Mr. Guzmán walked into the eighth-floor courtroom under guard shortly before 9:30 a.m. He wore a loosefitting gray suit, with his tie rakishly askew and a new-growth mustache darkening his upper lip.  Reading from a prepared statement, he said he had not received a fair trial and complained about his solitary confinement in Manhattan\\'s federal jail, calling it \"psychological, emotional and mental torture 24 hours a day.\" \"Since the government of the United States is going to send me to a prison where my name will never be heard again, I take advantage of this opportunity to say there was no justice here,\" he said. Though Judge Cogan did not specify where Mr. Guzmán would serve his sentence, he is likely to be sent to the country\\'s most forbidding federal prison, the United States Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility, or ADX, in Florence, Colo. Mr. Guzmán\\'s decades-long career atop the Sinaloa drug cartel, one of Mexico\\'s most powerful criminal mafias, came to a close only after years of joint investigation and pursuit by the American and Mexican authorities.  His ability to persistently evade capture — and then escape from prison after he was caught — underscored the deep corruption of the Mexican government by his cartel, which used bribery and intimidation to control not just the local, state and federal police, but some of the highest-ranking officials in the national government. \"It\\'s justice not only for the Mexican government, but for all of Guzmán\\'s victims in Mexico,\" said Raymond P. Donovan, the agent in charge of the New York office of the Drug Enforcement Administration, who was instrumental in capturing the kingpin twice.  After the sentencing, one of Mr. Guzmán\\'s lawyers, Jeffrey Lichtman, spoke outside the courthouse in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood, complaining, as his client had, that the lengthy legal proceeding had been unfair.  \"All he wanted was justice and at the end of the day, he didn\\'t get it,\" Mr. Lichtman said, adding, \"It was a show trial, and it\\'s been so since Day 1.\" Moments later, Richard P. Donoghue, the United States attorney in Brooklyn, whose office prosecuted the case with colleagues from Miami and Washington, also addressed reporters. Mr. Donoghue said the authorities could not undo the misery Mr. Guzmán had caused, \"but we can ensure that he spends every minute of every day of the rest of his life in prison.\" The trial took place under intense media scrutiny and tight security that involved bomb-sniffing dogs, police snipers and federal marshals with radiation sensors. The verdict on Feb. 12 came after more than a week of deliberations by the jury. Ultimately, Mr. Guzmán was found guilty on all 10 counts of the indictment. Prosecutors leveled some of the most serious charges possible against him, presenting evidence that he sent hundreds of tons of drugs to the United States from Mexico and caused the deaths of dozens of people to protect himself and his smuggling routes. The case revealed in exacting detail the inner workings of the Sinaloa drug cartel, such as how it employed I.T. consultants and how it packaged its cocaine in rubber \"condoms.\"  But given the defendant\\'s fame and notoriety, the trial was also a boisterous legal circus, complete with a horde of international reporters, a steady trickle of curious \"narco-tourists\" and a cameo appearance by an actor who plays the drug lord on a Netflix show. The American authorities began their hunt for the kingpin as far back as the early 1990s, when he was indicted on separate federal charges in Tucson and San Diego. The two indictments were filed just before and somewhat after he was arrested while on the run in Guatemala and then returned to Mexico, where he was tried and imprisoned for the 1993 murder of Juan Jesús Posadas Ocampo, a beloved Roman Catholic cardinal. In 2001, however, Mr. Guzmán broke out of prison — by many accounts, in the bottom of a laundry cart — and spent the next 13 years playing cat-and-mouse with the law. He evaded both arrest and the five subsequent indictments filed against him in the United States, largely by shuttling among a series of hide-outs in the Sierra Madre mountains in the Mexican state of Sinaloa. In February 2012, the Mexican and American authorities came within inches of nabbing him in an ocean-view mansion in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. But he was not caught until Mr. Donovan and a coalition of law enforcement and military officers on both sides of the border mounted a wiretap operation that cracked Mr. Guzmán\\'s communications network. He was found in a beachfront condominium in Mazatlán, Mexico, in February 2014. Within a year and a half, however, he had escaped again — this time, through a sophisticated tunnel that opened into the shower of his prison cell. A coalition similar to the one that caught him in 2014 redoubled its efforts and captured the kingpin for a second time, after a violent gunfight, in Los Mochis, Mexico, in early 2016. When Mr. Guzmán finally stood trial in New York in November, his conviction was all but assured given the mountains of evidence collected against him over the years. Some of that evidence came from incriminating intercepts from the various wiretaps over which agents had for months been listening in on the kingpin and his underlings. But just as damaging were the 14 witnesses from inside his cartel — suppliers, distributors, top lieutenants, even one of his mistresses — who testified against him. Since his extradition to the United States in January 2017, Mr. Guzmán has been held in 10 South, the maximum-security wing of the Manhattan federal jail. On Wednesday, he told Judge Cogan that since arriving there he had been forced to drink \"unsanitary water\" and wear earplugs made from toilet paper to drown out the racket of the ventilation system. In response, Gina Parlovecchio, a federal prosecutor, said it was ironic that Mr. Guzmán had complained about undignified treatment in jail given that he showed no respect to his countless victims, not just those he killed or hunted, but the thousands who were harmed by the drugs he \"pumped onto the streets,\" earning him a vast fortune of \"blood money.\" One of those victims, Andrea Velez, spoke out in court on Wednesday. She described through her tears how Mr. Guzmán had paid a Canadian chapter of the Hells Angels $1 million in a failed plot to murder her. Ms. Velez was at one point the personal assistant to one of the kingpin\\'s top lieutenants, Alex Cifuentes Villa, but eventually became an F.B.I. informant who spied on the drug lord and his allies. \"I\\'m a miracle of God,\" Ms. Velez said, \"because Mr. Guzmán tried to kill me.\"',\n",
       " ' (Want to get this briefing by email? Here\\'s the sign-up.) It has been three months since a fire consumed the wooden attic and toppled the 300-foot spire atop the Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris. Since then, The New York Times has conducted scores of interviews and reviewed hundreds of documents to reconstruct the missteps and how the cathedral was saved. What became clear is just how close the cathedral came to collapsing. What happened: A guard who responded to the fire went to the wrong building and found nothing. By the time the guard and a fire security company employee realized the mistake, the fire had been burning for more than 30 minutes.  Fighting the fire: Disadvantaged by their late start, firefighters rushed up the 300 steps to the attic only to be forced to retreat. Finally, a small group was sent directly into the flames in a desperate effort to save the cathedral. The fallout: A bitter round of finger-pointing continues over who was responsible for allowing the fire to rage unchecked for so long. The questions are at the heart of an investigation by the French authorities that will continue for months. Ursula von der Leyen of Germany, the first woman ever chosen to be the E.U.\\'s top bureaucrat, narrowly won approval from the European Parliament after her unexpected nomination as a compromise candidate. Ms. von der Leyen, 60, the German defense minister, will begin her five-year term as European Commission president in November. She struck a triumphant and conciliatory tone in her acceptance speech: \"The trust you place in me is confidence you place in Europe, confidence in a united and strong Europe, from east to west, from south to north.\" The job: Ms. von der Leyen will advance the bloc\\'s interests in trade talks, and she will oversee Brexit — one of the messiest and most painful events for the E.U. since it was conceived in the aftermath of World War II. Big picture: She will take on the role as the E.U. is increasingly caught in global trade and ideological struggles involving Russia, China, the U.S. and Iran. It also faces internal divisions stoked by rising nationalism. Election: Ms. von der Leyen emerged as a candidate only after the two top contenders faced implacable opposition. A member of the center-right Christian Democratic Union, she won support from the left by promising a minimum wage and a path to a carbon-neutral Europe. Galileo, the E.U.\\'s satellite navigation program, has been mostly down since Thursday — the latest mishap to befall the program since it began running in a pilot phase in late 2016. The E.U. had billed Galileo as more robust, precise and reliable than GPS — and a way to end the bloc\\'s reliance on a system controlled by the U.S. military. But technical problems have raised questions over whether new satellite launches should be paused until experts find the cause of the failures. The response: The E.U. has said that a technical incident related to the system\\'s ground infrastructure led to an interruption in its navigation and timing services. There was no word on when most services would be running again. Impact: Users are unlikely to have noticed the outage because phones and other devices are programmed to use Galileo in conjunction with other services, such as GPS, Russia\\'s Glonass and China\\'s Beidou.

       " ' NEW YORK — U.S. stock indexes fell on Wednesday as weak results from CSX Corp stoked concerns that the protracted trade war between the United States and China could hurt corporate earnings. CSX shares tumbled 10.3%, their biggest one-day drop since 2008, after the rail freight company posted lower-than-expected quarterly profit and cut its full-year revenue forecast. Ongoing trade tensions have contributed to a decline in truck and rail freight volumes in the first half of 2019. CSX was one of the biggest drags on the S&P 500 index, along with Union Pacific Corp and Berkshire Hathaway Inc, which owns BNSF Railway. Union Pacific, whose shares dropped 6.1%, reports results on Thursday. The losses in shares of rail companies helped push down the S&P 500 industrials index, whose 2.2% slide was the largest among the S&P\\'s 11 major sectors. The Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 3.6%. The Federal Reserve\\'s Beige Book, a compendium of anecdotes from U.S. businesses, also pointed to trade-related pressures on transportation and manufacturing companies. \"The trade concerns are such an uncertainty,\" said Stephen Carl, principal and head of U.S. equity trading at the Williams Capital Group in New York. \"It could be a huge negative impact. Costs are going to be coming from higher tariffs.\" But persistent trade-related concerns are a critical factor supporting expected interest-rate cuts from the Federal Reserve later this month, said Ed Campbell, portfolio manager and managing director at QMA in Newark, New Jersey. The anticipation of rate cuts has helped propel U.S. stocks to new highs in the past week. \"One of the things Trump is doing with trade is he\\'s using it as a cudgel against the Fed,\" Campbell said. \"The Fed is citing uncertainty relating to trade as a reason they\\'re open to cutting rates.\" The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 115.78 points, or 0.42%, to 27,219.85, the S&P 500 lost 19.62 points, or 0.65%, to 2,984.42 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 37.59 points, or 0.46%, to 8,185.21. Bank of America Corp rose 0.7% after posting a profit beat, though the company lowered its annual net interest income forecast. Netflix Inc shares tumbled in aftermarket trade after the company reported quarterly results. They were last down nearly 11%. Profit for S&P 500 companies is expected to rise 0.4% in the second quarter from a year ago, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Abbott Laboratories shares rose 3.1% after the medical device maker topped quarterly profit estimates and lifted its full-year adjusted earnings forecast. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.67-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.73-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 25 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 58 new highs and 86 new lows.

       " ' BOSTON — Massachusetts prosecutors on Wednesday dropped a criminal case accusing former \"House of Cards\" star Kevin Spacey of sexually assaulting an 18-year-old man at a Nantucket bar in 2016 after the alleged victim refused to testify. Prosecutors said they made the decision to drop the felony indecent assault and battery charge against the Oscar winner after the alleged victim invoked his right under the U.S. Constitution against giving self-incriminating testimony. Spacey\\'s lawyers had previously accused the man of deleting text messages that would support his defense. The man invoked his Fifth Amendment rights during a hearing earlier this month concerning the whereabouts of his cell phone, which was missing. A lawyer for Spacey, 59, did not respond to requests for comment.  Spacey, who has won two Oscars, including the best actor Academy Award in 2000 for his role in \"American Beauty,\" had pleaded not guilty to the charge. His lawyers had called the allegations \"patently false.\" Mitchell Garabedian, the accuser\\'s lawyer, said in a statement that his client had \"shown an enormous amount of courage under difficult circumstances.\" The case\\'s filing last year marked one of the relatively rare criminal prosecutions of the #MeToo era, which has seen mostly women reveal widespread patterns of sexual harassment and abuse in entertainment, business and politics. The allegations emerged after another actor accused Spacey of trying to seduce him three decades ago when he was 14, leading Netflix to drop Spacey from \"House of Cards,\" and to his scenes being edited out of the film \"All the Money in the World.\" Spacey first became embroiled in controversy in October 2017 when actor Anthony Rapp accused him of trying to seduce him in 1986, when Rapp was 14. Spacey apologized for his inappropriate conduct with Rapp. The Nantucket accuser told police Spacey had bought him several rounds of beer and whiskey at the Club Car Restaurant on the island in July 2016 when he was 18 and, according to charging documents, said at one point, \"Let\\'s get drunk.\" As they stood next to a piano, Spacey groped the man, he told investigators. Spacey\\'s accuser sued on June 26, but dropped the lawsuit a week later ahead of a July 8 hearing in Nantucket District Court regarding his phone, which his lawyer said he could not find after being ordered to turn it over to Spacey\\'s attorneys. He then invoked his Fifth Amendment rights after taking questions from an attorney for Spacey about whether text messages were deleted from the phone before it was given to investigators.

MSCI\\'s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down a touch, while Japan\\'s benchmark Nikkei fell 1.3% and Australian shares dropped 0.4%. South Korea\\'s market was off 0.4%. Moments earlier, the Bank of Korea unexpectedly cut its policy interest rate for the first time in three years, as uncertainties from a trade dispute with Japan added to anxiety about the economy\\'s outlook. On Wall Street, all three major indexes fell on Wednesday as weak results from trade-related CSX Corp stoked concerns that the protracted trade standoff between the United States and China could hurt U.S. corporate earnings. Earlier in the week, U.S. President Donald Trump kept up the pressure on Beijing with a threat to put tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese goods, amid market nervousness over when face-to-face talks will resume. The Wall Street Journal reported that progress toward a U.S.-China trade deal has stalled while the Trump administration determines how to address Beijing\\'s demands that it ease restrictions on Huawei Technologies.

We think we are somewhere in between those views,\" said Paras Anand, head of asset management for Asia Pacific at Fidelity International. Indeed, Treasury yields fell as concerns about the U.S.-China trade war boosted demand for safe haven debt and after data showed weakness in the U.S. housing market.  Yields on benchmark 10-year and 30-year bonds climbed more than seven basis points each, to 2.06% and 2.57%, respectively. U.S. homebuilding fell for a second straight month in June and permits dropped to a two-year low, suggesting the housing market continued to struggle despite declining mortgage rates. In the foreign exchange market, the dollar nursed light losses on Thursday, weighed down by lower U.S. yields and a rebound by the pound from 27-month lows. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Wednesday said the dollar was overvalued by 6% to 12%, based on near-term economic fundamentals. The dollar index versus a basket of six major currencies was nearly flat at 97.119 after shedding 0.2% the previous day.  The euro was not much changed at $1.1285 after crawling up 0.1% on Wednesday. The greenback fell 0.3% to 107.660 yen, extending an overnight loss of 0.3%. Sterling was steady at $1.2433. It had stumbled to $1.2382 overnight, its lowest level since April 2017 on concerns of a no-deal Brexit. Precious metals were in demand. Gold prices rose more than 1% on Wednesday as weaker-than-expected U.S. data reinforced expectations for an interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve later this month, dragging the dollar lower.

Silver soared about 2.5% on Wednesday to hit a more than four-month high of $15.96, extending gains for a fourth straight session. The metal was last quoted at $16.06. Oil futures fell on Thursday, pushing losses for a fourth straight session after U.S. government data showed large builds in refined product stockpiles.

       " ' \"Orange Is the New Black,\" finishing its seven-season run on July 26, was big. Big in its reach (presumably, though actual viewing figures for Netflix series are still an occult mystery). Big in its influence, as one of the first genuinely original programs in the new medium of streaming. Big in its ambitions to represent faces and situations that had been left off TV screens. But also, it was simply big — teeming, packed to the ceiling with characters and story — in a way that becomes clear when you peek at Netflix\\'s spoiler list for its final season. Oh, the things I cannot tell you about this show! Deaths and releases and imprisonments. Reappearances and disappearances. Love and change and illness and new circumstances and more death. A dozen and a half characters are named; far more are implied. The list does not say anything about the chickens, though. So I will tell you about the chickens. If you\\'ve watched \"Orange,\" you remember the chicken, in Season 1, rumored to be roaming the grounds of Litchfield, the women\\'s prison at which the series is set. The bird became a legend, a talisman, a symbol of elusive liberty and hope. In one of many callbacks to the series\\'s beginnings, the final season features more chickens, being raised as part of a program for the prison\\'s \"neurodiverse\" inmates. One clucker meets a bad end, and Suzanne Warren (Uzo Aduba) becomes convinced that there is a murderer among the flock. She tries separating them, confining them, surveilling them. You can\\'t be too careful with chickens, she says. They\\'re \"superpredators.\" The prisoner becomes the jailer: O.K., it\\'s not subtle. But the chicken is a pretty apt metaphor for \"Orange.\" Chickens are, after all, confined animals. They are — like the women locked up by a private prison corporation — creatures kept for profit. They are especially associated with the maternal, that is, the egg. They can\\'t fly very well, which is to say, they are grounded by factors beyond simply their cages. They maintain, within captivity, their own pecking order. A chicken is not a lofty winged symbol of freedom, like the eagle or butterfly. Yet it scratches out a living. It perseveres. It is, like \"Orange Is the New Black\" itself, an odd, sometimes ungainly, yet majestic being. I\\'m not sure what to call the current creative era of TV — the one that began, roughly, with the twilight of cable classics like \"The Sopranos\" and \"Breaking Bad\" and with the dawn of streaming television. The Netflix era? The post-antihero era? But whatever it is, \"Orange Is the New Black\" was the beginning of it. When it arrived in summer 2013, it was not the first original series to air on Netflix. But it was really the first \"Netflix series\" in the sense we think of it now. \"Lilyhammer,\" in 2012, was a Norwegian import; \"Arrested Development,\" earlier in 2013, was a revival. Even \"House of Cards,\" for all the attention it got when it debuted a few months before \"Orange,\" was a dark drama about a brooding, dastardly alpha male that could have aired on Showtime. \"Orange Is the New Black,\" on the other hand, was an original story, as opposed to \"Cards,\" which had been adapted from a British series. (The creator, Jenji Kohan, used Piper Kerman\\'s prison memoir of the same name as a jumping-off point.) It had some of the markers of old-school network TV but the specificity and scope of premium cable. It was nuanced and ambitious, but also broad and unpretentiously bawdy. It was dedicated to telling underrepresented stories. It was something else, and it spent seven seasons establishing exactly what. When Netflix first started making programming, it wasn\\'t clear what \"Netflix shows\" would look like, even to the people making them. \"Arrested Development\" Season 4 was a four-dimensional web of narrative, within which you might chase a plot thread from Episode 3 forward to Episode 8 and back to Episode 1. \"House of Cards\" simply approached streaming as premium cable by other means. \"Orange\" was the first series to show us how streaming TV would really work and to teach us how to watch it. The show looked like traditional TV, even more so than its fancier recent contemporaries in cable. It didn\\'t aim for the striking images of a \"Breaking Bad,\" the lapidary indie-film intimacy of \"Enlightened\" or the meticulous design curation of \"Mad Men.\" Its aesthetic and composition were utilitarian, drab even, fitting its institutional setting. It achieved its effects more through conversation than through luminous visuals, much as early TV modeled itself on theater as opposed to cinema. It even had a TV schedule, of a sort; it came out once a year, always in June or July. But in practice, in the way the viewer encountered it, it was like little that preceded it. Its distinguishing assets were size and time: The seasons and episodes could be vast, and you could watch them as fast as you wanted. This was immersive, and it was suited to a story that began with a character being thrown into the deep end. Piper Chapman (Taylor Schilling), a Brooklyn artisanal soap maker convicted on a drug charge, has to suddenly acclimate herself to a sprawling society of women of far less privilege. The enormous catalog of characters and alliances, which was a barrier of entry with sweeping weekly series like \"The Wire,\" was easier to take in when you swallowed it whole, rather than in weekly bites. But watching a show is only half the cultural experience of TV. The other half is the conversation around it, which changes when you no longer have people watching one show on one channel on one night. The audience would not be aggregated, they would have to find one another — something enabled by social media, which helpfully rose around the same time. As one of the first streaming phenomena, \"Orange\" taught us about this too. Its cultural reach wasn\\'t immediately apparent; we didn\\'t, and still don\\'t, have the kind of independent ratings figures for it that we do for network and cable series. Netflix shows — like Amazon shows, and Hulu shows, and presumably all the shows to come on HBO Max and Disney Plus and Apple TV Plus and so on — would not announce themselves overnight with big Nielsen numbers. They would rise up and percolate outward, like the whispers around a cell block. Then there was the matter of whose stories \"Orange\" told. The era of celebrated TV that preceded it had a preferred protagonist type: mostly white, mostly men, mostly like the sorts of people who ran TV networks. The next era would be open to a wider range of identity, color, sexual orientation and life experience. And \"Orange\" was instrumental in busting those gates open. At first, it seemed like it would center privileged, WASP-y Piper as the audience\\'s guide into a world of black and brown and lower-income women. But she turned out to be the series Trojan Drug Mule. She smuggled the viewer in; once inside, we found a series in which anyone, any episode, could be the lead. \"Orange,\" though it had its share of male guards and significant others, was thoroughly and unapologetically woman-centric. It was polymorphous in gender and sexual identity. Its inmates were transgender, straight, bi, gay, \"gay for the stay.\" More than diverse, it was complex. Its prison cliques tended to divide along racial lines, but within those groups were subdivisions, differences that came from generation, from background, from the simple fact that every person is an individual. The episodes\\' structure bolstered that philosophy, interweaving flashbacks into the present-day narrative. We learned how Tiffany Doggett (Taryn Manning), introduced as Piper\\'s belligerent, Bible-thumping antagonist, had her sense of self-worth destroyed in her childhood; how Dayanara Diaz (Dascha Polanco) evolved from a dreamy, artistic young girl into a hardened felon; how Gloria Mendoza (Selenis Leyva) landed in prison while escaping an abusive relationship. The series was an illustration of the principle that, when it comes to representing people, quantity sometimes does equal quality. When you have an abundance of characters of different colors, ethnicities and class backgrounds, you can show that none of those groups are monoliths, because no one person has to represent an entire demographic. In a way, the composition of \"Orange\" — a vast ensemble, composed of subgroups that break down into sub-subgroups — was a metaphor for Netflix, and the ways in which it was and wasn\\'t like mass-media TV of the past. Like the old broadcast networks, it aimed to make TV for everyone. But like the niche cable channels, it didn\\'t try to make each individual show appeal to everyone. It was macro and micro, a confederation rather than a monoculture. To tell its story of a new America, \"Orange\" used one other old-TV trick: It had a flexible timeline, in which a little more than a year passed in prison time, yet the series ran from the mid-Obama years to Donald Trump\\'s 2019, with each season reflecting the politics of the outside world. In the final season, this means a #MeToo story line and a brutal arc about I.C.E. and immigration detentions. In another series, this might seem like a forced attempt to keep up with current events. In \"Orange,\" it works; its prison world is one where time moves differently than on the outside, where the names and policies may change, but the essential divide remains between those who get to cross the wall, and those who can\\'t. This is a good place to point out that, however heavy the material, \"Orange\" is consistently a laugh riot, even when it has involved actual riots. This is the final way in which the series is a work of this TV era, in which the best work is dominated not by comedies or dramas but by series — \"BoJack Horseman,\" \"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,\" \"Atlanta,\" \"Better Things,\" \"Transparent,\" \"Fleabag\" — that exist in the uneasy and fertile zone between the two. \"Orange\" defies categorization more fiercely than most. Literally, in awards competition, it\\'s been submitted as both a comedy and a drama, underscoring how arbitrary those categories are to begin with. In part, this is in the show\\'s creative DNA. Kohan previously made \"Weeds,\" a dark Showtime comedy about a suburban widow who takes up drug dealing. In part, \"Orange\" is an update of satires like \"M*A*S*H,\" which steered as hard into the absurdity of institutional bureaucracy as it did into the tragedy of war. But its unnerving blend — not \"dark comedy\" or \"light drama\" but straight-out hilarity intercut with stark horror — might also be the only honest way to capture the complexities of its subject and its characters. Some of the inmates are nonviolent offenders; others have killed. Some have suffered bad breaks, abuse or straight-up injustice; others are dangerous, vicious and unrepentant. \"Orange\" extends understanding to all of them (as well as to bullying guards and cynical prison executives) while not simply excusing anyone. If it\\'s jarring in how it can shift from laughter to shock, slapstick to shivving, it may be because accepting the complexities of real, flawed humans in a flawed system is jarring, too. This has honestly made the seven years of \"Orange\" a tough balancing act. It was strongest in its first four seasons, at the end of which the young, hopeful inmate Poussey Washington (Samira Wiley) was choked to death while being restrained by a guard. Her wrenching, violent end alienated some viewers to whom it prodded at the wounds of real-life police brutality cases, or recalled an ignominious history of series killing off lesbian characters.  The incident was polarizing, but it was not handled lightly or forgotten. In retrospect, it was the fulcrum of the series\\'s whole run, and its repercussions continue through the end of the final season. In Seasons 5 (set during the resulting riot) and 6 (dealing with the riot\\'s aftermath), the series tilted more toward the somber, and the comedy felt more discordant. Season 7 — not to violate the perimeter of Netflix\\'s maximum-security spoiler list — is, if not the show\\'s best, a return to form. The centerpiece is the story of Tasha \"Taystee\" Jefferson (the outstanding Danielle Brooks), facing life in prison for a murder she didn\\'t commit during the riot. The first person Piper met in Litchfield, Taystee, in retrospect, is the actual aching heart of \"Orange.\" The season steers between nihilism and false hope. It recognizes that the weaknesses of the justice system and the forces behind the cycle of crime may be intractable. (In another blunt metaphor, a reform-minded new prison official asks how she can adjust a chair in her office; \"You can\\'t,\" she\\'s told. \"It\\'s broken.\") Yet it holds out the possibility of redemption, small acts of decency and strokes of luck. \"Orange Is the New Black\" is not the best series of its time, but it just might be the most representative of what is best and most exciting about TV during this period of intense change. Is it comedy or drama? Is it an old-school throwback or a harbinger of the future? Is it a show formed by the imperatives of streaming or a show that created the genre\\'s rules? The beauty of a series this expansive and polymorphous is that it can be all of these things at once. It is the chicken, and it is the egg.',\n",
       " ' When the first season of \"Orange Is the New Black\" premiered in 2013, the majority of its cast were relative unknowns. Fast-forward to the present: \"Orange\" veterans and alumni are seemingly everywhere from the screen to the stage. Below, a look at Litchfield Penitentiary\\'s biggest breakouts.  Uzo Aduba studied classical voice at Boston University before moving to New York to pursue theater. She was on the verge of quitting acting when she learned she had landed the part of the zany, troubled Suzanne Warren, also known as Crazy Eyes, a role for which she won two Emmys. Although Suzanne doesn\\'t sing often enough, Aduba has showed off her pipes several times, singing opera on \"The View,\" performing a duet with Taylor Swift and playing Glinda the Good Witch in \"The Wiz Live!\" on NBC. Next, she\\'ll be playing a trailblazer: Shirley Chisholm, the first African-American Congresswoman, in the coming FX limited series \"Mrs. America.\" The androgynous Australian model, singer and V.J. Ruby Rose broke through in the United States as Stella Carlin, Piper\\'s devious love interest in Season 3, and quickly became a face of gender-fluid awareness. Her \"Orange\" stint was brief, but her star has been on the rise since, with roles in several blockbuster action films including a sharpshooter in \"XXX: Return of Xander Cage,\" a sultry assassin in \"John Wick: Chapter 2\" and — why not? — a marine scientist in the monster-shark opus \"The Meg.\" Next up, Rose will star as Kate Kane, better known as Batwoman, TV\\'s first openly lesbian superhero, in a series that will debut on CW in October. Dascha Polanco, a nursing student when she tried out for \"Orange,\" came to her audition straight from an overnight hospital shift, still in scrubs. She continued her studies — and held down an administrative job at a Bronx hospital — throughout the shooting of Season 1. Since playing the increasingly hardened Dayanara Diaz, Polanco has worked with David O. Russell (who cast her as Jennifer Lawrence\\'s B.F.F. in \"Joy\") and Ryan Murphy (who cast her as a no-nonsense detective in \"The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story\"). She also joined Natasha Lyonne in \"Russian Doll,\" playing a disaffected love interest, and is next set to appear in Lin-Manuel Miranda\\'s film adaptation of his Broadway musical \"In the Heights.\" Much like Nicky Nichols, her plucky \"Orange\" character, this onetime \"American Pie\" star fell into a heroin addiction and had to claw her way back out. Natasha Lyonne\\'s struggles with dependence and with other health issues (including Hepatitis C, a collapsed lung and a heart infection) nearly derailed her career, but \"Orange\" saved it and led her to an Emmy nomination. She also mines elements of her past trauma as Nadia Vulvokov in the critically lauded Netflix series \"Russian Doll,\" a show she co-created, produced, directed and wrote. Lyonne recently signed a first-look television deal with Amazon Studios. Danielle Brooks was fresh out of Juilliard when she was cast as Tasha Jefferson, known as Taystee, the brash best friend of Poussey Washington (Samira Wiley). Since being cast in \"Orange,\" she has added more TV work to her resume, stealing scenes in guest spots from Jemima Kirke on \"Girls\" and from Aziz Ansari on \"Master of None.\" Brooks has also found success in the theater world: She made her Broadway debut in the 2015 revival of \"The Color Purple,\" earning a Tony nomination for her powerful portrayal of Sofia, and earlier this year she played Beatrice in the Shakespeare in the Park production of \"Much Ado About Nothing.\" Samira Wiley, who had already met Brooks while they were both studying at Juilliard, hung onto her bartending job through the filming of Season 1 of \"Orange,\" scared that she might be written off. (This had happened to her before, after appearing in the first two episodes of \"Unforgettable.\") Instead, she played the good-natured Poussey Washington for four seasons until her character\\'s shocking death. She then moved from one women\\'s prison to another, joining the Republic of Gilead in \"The Handmaid\\'s Tale\" (along with the fellow \"Orange\" alum Madeline Brewer). Wiley\\'s portrayal on that series of the valiant refugee Moira won her an Emmy, and she has stayed busy recently as Karen\\'s love interest on \"Will & Grace.\" Up next: \"BIOS,\" a sci-fi feature with Tom Hanks. Asia Kate Dillon, who identifies as gender nonbinary, played Lucifer in an off-off-Broadway production of \"The Mysteries\" before joining \"Orange\" in Season 4 as the calm and collected white supremacist Brandy Epps. (Dillon\\'s real-life neck tattoo, which reads \"Einfühlung,\" translates as \"empathy.\") Dillon then turned up playing Taylor Mason on \"Billions,\" the first major gender nonbinary character on American television. That role and a role as the Adjudicator in \"John Wick: Chapter 3\" have made Dillon a sort of nonbinary emissary to the wider culture.  Diane Guerrero almost quit acting just before landing her \"Orange\" gig, portraying the sociable inmate Maritza Ramos. The following year, she landed the part of the outgoing best friend Lina on \"Jane the Virgin.\" More recently, she starred as Crazy Jane, a superhero with multiple personalities, on the DC Universe show \"Doom Patrol.\" Guerrero advocates for immigration reform, and her memoir, \"In the Country We Love: My Family Divided,\" is reportedly being developed for television. Matt McGorry is a former bodybuilder, personal trainer and all-around buff guy. He had bit parts in a couple of New York-based shows (\"Gossip Girl,\" \"Person of Interest\") before landing the role of Officer John Bennett, the \"nice guard\" who impregnated Dayanara. While still on \"Orange\" — he left after Season 3 — McGorry joined the cast of \"How to Get Away With Murder\" as the awkward Asher Millstone. Along the way, he has become a household name for his (polarizing) outspoken feminism and his outrageous stripper-dance moves. A onetime fixture in New York\\'s downtown club scene (singing operatic versions of heavy metal songs), Laverne Cox cautiously declined to leave her job at the drag show cabaret Lucky Cheng\\'s while the first season of \"Orange\" was in production. But within a year of playing the prison hairdresser Sophia Burset, Cox had become Hollywood\\'s most famous openly transgender actress — the first to get an Emmy nomination, to be on the cover of Time magazine, to have a wax figure installed at Madame Tussauds. Since then, Cox has donned a corset to play Dr. Frank-N-Furter in a TV version of \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" and hosted the reality show \"Glam Masters.\" She was also a regular on the short-lived CBS legal drama \"Doubt.\"',\n",
       " ' In his Netflix film \"Rolling Thunder Revue,\" which chronicles Bob Dylan\\'s face-paint-streaked 1975 tour of the same name, Martin Scorsese introduces us to a former congressman from Michigan named Jack Tanner. Tanner sits at a farmhouse table in a spacious home, wearing a tweed jacket and no tie, hair gray and a little shaggy, a patrician Everyboomer who could have walked out of a financial-planning ad. In November of \\'75, he says, he was on the way home from a meeting with Jimmy Carter when a storm grounded his plane in Niagara Falls, N.Y. He called Carter from the motel. \"He says, \\'Well, you just hit the jackpot,\\'\\u2009\" Tanner recalls. \"\\u2009\\'Bob Dylan is doing this Rolling Thunder concert there tonight, and you can go.\\'\\u2009\" This is a trope in documentaries about \\'60s and \\'70s pop culture, including Scorsese\\'s own: the aging boomer dewily recalling his brush with the generational moment. Tanner, like Dylan and Scorsese, was born slightly ahead of the baby boom. But he was drawn to the new generation\\'s youthful energy, he explains, especially working among the silverbacks in the House of Representatives. \"Dylan was considered the enemy, really, by a lot of these guys,\" he says. The film cuts to Dylan and his band ripping through a fierce \"Hurricane,\" his protest anthem about the wrongful triple-murder conviction of the boxer Rubin Carter. Midsong, Scorsese returns to Tanner, who recites the lyrics: \"Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties/Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise.\" His voice seems far away, as if the song\\'s moral clarity were a solvent stripping away the decades of little compromises and rationalizations and self-disappointments that make a politician\\'s life, recalling an earlier iteration of himself. Tanner\\'s squareness rescues him from cliché: There is something surprisingly affecting about watching a congressman talk about the music he loves. It\\'s a charming scene, not much diminished by the fact that Jack Tanner does not exist. He is one of several fictional elements that Scorsese filigrees around the tour-documentary core of \"Rolling Thunder Revue\": a character lifted, in a novel crossover move, from Robert Altman\\'s \"Tanner \\'88.\" That 1988 HBO mini-series followed the long-shot Democratic presidential campaign of the titular character, played by the actor Michael Murphy. His appearance in \"Rolling Thunder Revue\" is, on its face, puzzling; why, Rob Salkowitz wondered in Forbes, did Scorsese summon a fictional politician to speak to Dylan\\'s influence \"when you probably could have gotten the exact same lines out of a real person like Gary Hart?\" But Tanner\\'s fictionality gives him a peculiar resonance that Hart wouldn\\'t have had. He\\'s not a member of a generation; he\\'s a mirror. Like \"Rolling Thunder Revue,\" \"Tanner \\'88\" is a road movie doubling as a generational odyssey. The loose script was written by the \"Doonesbury\" cartoonist Garry Trudeau, and like the comic strip\\'s characters, Jack Tanner is a sharp but affectionate satire of a baby boomer in autumn. His early radicalism has aged into a vague, self-satisfied liberalism, warmed by the afterglow of his participation in historical moments, or at least his proximity to them. He is proud to have an F.B.I. file, but there\\'s nothing very incriminating in it. Watching a Tanner campaign ad stuffed with stock footage from the 1960s, a focus-group member complains: \"He had Kennedy, he had Martin Luther King — I mean, where\\'s his ideas?\" Trudeau, like most of the baby boom\\'s great bards, makes certain assumptions about where his generation\\'s center of gravity lies. His archetypal boomer has traded dean\\'s-office occupations for corner-office employment, but a little sheepishly, walking away from the counterculture without really repudiating it. These boomers have mellowed, yes, but they have also mellowed the country: made it a more liberal, tolerant, open-minded place, a place where a moderate Democratic Leadership Council type like Jack Tanner can propose drug decriminalization or, briefly, make \"social justice\" his campaign theme. Even the most irreverent versions of this generational self-portrait can never fully evade the smugness they intend to skewer — the implication that their subjects, for all their narcissism, excess and eventual hypocrisy, were ultimately on the winning side of history. But sometimes history throws a curveball. From the perspective of 2019, the arc of boomer politics does not seem to have bent inexorably toward Tanner\\'s mushy liberalism; for now, at least, it ends with Donald Trump. According to Pew Research Center polling, boomers now identify with the conservatism of the Republican right more readily than any other political ideology. Today\\'s politics are shaped far less by the intra-Democratic street fighting of 1968 or Vietnam or Watergate than by the subtler, structural consequences of the Civil Rights and Immigration and Nationality Acts: the black-and-white part of the \\'60s, not the Day-Glo coda that dominates the ex-hippie narrative. Resurfacing in \"Rolling Thunder Revue,\" Jack Tanner looks less like an avatar of a generational experience and more like a figure who has newly found himself outside it. We know now that the real story wasn\\'t the people at the protests and the concerts; it was all the people who weren\\'t. This lends a plaintive edge to his nostalgia, and to Scorsese\\'s. After the film fades out on Tanner, a voice — it sounds like Scorsese himself — intones: \"Let America be America again. Let it be the dream it used to be.\" These are the opening lines of a Langston Hughes poem. John Kerry, that Zelig of the boomer political experience, used the first sentence as a slogan in his 2004 campaign. \"It\\'s a statement about what\\'s broken,\" a campaign staff member told The Times that June, \"and that something\\'s broken — but it\\'s also a statement of hope and aspiration.\" In Scorsese\\'s mouth, the words seem at once to refer to the actual Rolling Thunder Revue — an attempt to \"rediscover America,\" as Allen Ginsberg, who came along for the ride, described it — and to his own film, a bombastic plea to let the boomer legacy be the dream it used to be. But \"Let America Be America Again\" is a dark and angry poem, an explicit critique of national nostalgia. Hughes denounces the vast chasm between America\\'s promises and its reality for people of color, for immigrants, for the poor, answering the stanza that Kerry and Scorsese borrowed with a bitter parenthetical: \"America never was America to me.\" He concludes the poem with a call to \"make America again!\": an exhortation one word short of a Trump slogan but a world removed from it, a call not to the sentimentality of the left or the right but for rebuilding the thing from the original blueprints, and better this time. He is saying that the most comforting stories Americans tell themselves about themselves are the ones that never happened.']"
