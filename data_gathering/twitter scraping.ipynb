    "Twitter has a very restrictive API/charges you for more than 50 requests a month (!), so I looked into other options to try to scrape down the text from tweets. A classmate suggest Twint, which looks like a great tool, though turned out to be hard to install for inexplicable reasons and then ended up not actually working on my machine?\n",
    "\n",
    "Twint prints out an output of the tweets it scrapes, but also ostensibly is meant to be able to save down the actual data into a csv, json or directly into a pandas dataframe. For some reason, on my machine it won't save the scraped data down. So this notebook consists mostly of my workaround for getting at the scraped data which involves saving down the system output of the scraper to a .txt file, then reading the contents of that file back into the notebook as a string upon which the sentiment analysis could be performed. As with the NYT article scraping, I did the actual scraping with .py file in the terminal, rather than from the notebook, which would be a little over-burdened by the scraping at scale."
