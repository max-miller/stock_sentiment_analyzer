0,2016-01-01," Cherry Jones may have played the president on the Fox series ""24,"" but she admits to being a ""theater snob"" who always thought she would do her best work on the stage. Then she saw the first season of ""Transparent,"" the critically lauded series on Amazon, chronicling the life of Maura Pfefferman (Jeffrey Tambor), who comes out to her adult children as a transgender woman. ""Why, oh, why can't I be on a show like that?"" Ms. Jones asked. Ms. Jones, 59, had to wait only a few months for her wish to come true. Jill Soloway, the creator of ""Transparent,"" called her with a proposal for the second season: She wanted Ms. Jones to play a swaggering, stately poetry professor named Leslie Mackinaw, modeled on the radical feminist poet Eileen Myles (whom Ms. Soloway had just started dating). Mackinaw has a complicated relationship with Maura and her daughter Ali, played by Gaby Hoffmann. ""We Skyped, and she told me the arc, and I just couldn't believe Jill was talking to me,"" Ms. Jones said. ""And within weeks, I found myself in a scene with Gaby Hoffmann and Jeffrey Tambor. I was such a fan I could barely look at them. It was like I had just walked out of my living room into an iconic American television show."" Below are excerpts, edited and condensed, from a conversation about Ms. Jones's experience working on the show and what she has coming up next.  Q. Your character, Leslie Mackinaw, is based on the real-life poet Eileen Myles. Did you know that going into it? A. In that first Skype, Jill asked me if I knew who Eileen was, and I said, sadly, that I did not. She mentioned that they were seeing one another, and that the idea had come for this older poetry professor and Ali to have a kind of relationship. But I'm not really playing Eileen; I could never capture the charisma of Ms. Myles. We are actually together in three different scenes, so if I really had been trying to do Eileen, it would have been even more intimidating than it was. Q. Why do you think Ms. Soloway thought of you to play Leslie? A. Well, I think it was important to her that I was a bona fide older lesbian. But it was so funny. I said to Jill: ""All my life I've been gay and have always known I was gay. I was a tomboy and always thought I was pretty masculine."" So when she said, ""You're going to be playing this great dude dyke professor,"" I thought, Perfect. And then I realized, I am such a girl. I had to really work on my dude dykeness. Thanks to Eileen Myles, I got my hair cut into this short style. It's changed my life. I feel semi-hip now. Q. A lot of your character's arc focuses on tensions between radical feminists and the transgender community. Did you know about those issues beforehand? A. You know, before working on this show, I didn't know a trans person well at all. And now I am surrounded by all these trans writers and actors who are leading the way and teaching me so much. Intellectually, I understand both sides of the argument my character engages in, but as someone who tries to love all human beings, I think it's just ridiculous in the end. Often, trans women have no safe place to turn. I certainly don't want to be on the side of those who make their lives more difficult. It seems absurd in this day and age, especially when we are just tiny specks in the universe. Q. How do you feel about being involved in a show that touches on gender in a new way? ""Transparent"" pushes a lot of boundaries. A. It is so rare in any form of American entertainment that you feel like you are making a difference. I sort of feel like it is the 21st century's version of ""All in the Family."" That was a show when I was a kid in the '70s that was opening people's eyes and dealing with prejudice and addressing a couple of centuries' worth of baggage, and doing it nightly for 40 million people. I wish ""Transparent"" could get out to that many people. Q. What's next for you? I know you are going to be in the mini-series based on Stephen King's novel ""11/22/63,"" about the day John F. Kennedy died. A. Yes, I was shooting ""Transparent"" at the same time I was shooting ""11/22/63."" I would play Leslie Mackinaw and then get on a plane to Toronto and play Lee Harvey Oswald's mother. The characters were as divergent as they could be. It was like I was in my own little rep company. I know for certain we are taking ""The Glass Menagerie"" to the Edinburgh Festival and Dublin for three months next year, and I am so excited. Hopefully Zach Quinto and Celia Keenan-Bolger and Brian J. Smith can join us again. How cool to get to go from Leslie Mackinaw to Amanda Wingfield! I'm having the kind of year actors live for. Q. You are so closely associated with the New York theater scene. Are you glad to be expanding into more television work? A. Theater will always be my home, but I remember Julie Harris and Frances Sternhagen beating advice into my head when I was being a little theater snob in the '90s. They said, ""Darling, if you want to work when you are older, you have got to diversify."""
0,2016-01-12," DESNA, Czech Republic — When the January issue of National Geographic landed in his mailbox last year, Petr Pus nearly fell to the floor. There on the cover and throughout the issue were members of the Kayapo tribe, living far up the Amazon in conditions more Stone Age than information age, all of them adorned with face paint and a glittering assortment of beads. ""I couldn't believe it,"" said Mr. Pus, the marketing director for Preciosa Ornela, which claims to be the world's largest producer of high-end glass beads. ""They were literally wearing our beads."" Venture up the Amazon or into a Masai Mara village in Kenya, explore a jungle bazaar in southern India or even a roadside shop in Arizona selling Navajo knockoffs, and the chances are excellent that most of the beads you will see were produced in this unlikely mountain village a stone's throw from the Polish frontier and a short drive to Germany. For four and a half centuries, since Czech artisans brought back the secrets of glassmaking from the Venetian island of Murano, the narrow and tree-choked valleys of northern Bohemia have been producing a dizzying array of glass beads in all manner of colors, sizes, shapes and decorative flourishes. And despite passing through history's threshing machine with a series of conquering rulers, including kings, emperors, freedom fighters, Gestapo thugs and communist dictators, the artisans are still at it. The Preciosa factory, which produces the beads using a mixture of traditional processes and modern industrial techniques, remains, with 900 workers, the chief employer in this small village of 3,000 people. And while a flood of cheaper Chinese beads has poured out of Asia over the last five or six years, putting many of Bohemia's traditional mom-and-pop beadmakers out of business, producers of the higher-end products — known as seed beads and made here by Preciosa and in Japan by a few operations — are experiencing one of their periodic bursts of prosperity. ""It's a good job, with good pay and you get to say you are helping to make products that are the best in the world,"" said Zdenek Gyalog, 29. He oversees the sorting department, whose workers, in many cases, have been at Preciosa for 15 or 20 years, and their parents before them. ""If my son, someday, comes to me and says he wants to go into this business,"" Mr. Gyalog said, ""I certainly would not oppose it."" Desna became a center of Bohemian bead production a little over 150 years ago when Josef Riedel, the descendant of generations of glass traders and manufacturers, built a factory astride a chattering river with the ragged Jizera Mountains looming on all sides. Some of his original buildings are now part of the Preciosa complex. The Riedel family tomb dominates a steep hillside across the road from the factory, and the white mansion of the man once known as the glass king of the Jizera Mountains is down the road, now a museum. For centuries, beads and glass vessels were made here in small workshops, or in literal cottage industries run by families, often as a second source of income. The houses are still easily identifiable in the surrounding countryside, notable for their two chimneys, indicating that a glass furnace anchored one part of the property. Today, nearly all of those mom-and-pop operations have fallen by the wayside, said Josef Nagy, 48, who runs a small beadmaking operation in the village of Pencin, not far from the Preciosa complex in Desna. Since only Preciosa has the technology capable of making the higher-quality seed beads, smaller manufacturers — like Mr. Nagy's company, Fipobex — target smaller and more specialized markets. But the Chinese competition does not make it easy. ""Everybody is struggling,"" Mr. Nagy said. A decade ago, he had 120 employees. Now there are only 15, and much of the equipment in his aging factory sits idle. To make up for the lost revenue, the company started giving tours, opened a goat farm, a museum of agriculture, and a craft shop where people can experiment with making their own beaded jewelry. ""We could see the writing on the wall,"" Mr. Nagy said. But as the smaller operations have struggled, Preciosa's bead factory in Desna has only flourished, as has the town. ""As we say, beads are a cheap joy for poor people,"" Mr. Pus said, leading the way late last year across a water-slick floor in an old, traditional furnace room. Through eight gaping gates, workers scoop molten glass out of red-hot pots in the brick furnace. The glowing ingots sink with an angry hiss into wooden tubs of water large enough to swallow an easy chair. The seed beads that are the basis of Preciosa's current prosperity are more difficult to produce than ordinary glass beads — in which molten glass is pressed into a mold — but allow artisans a wider array of treatments, flourishes and colors. Glass rods are melted in a furnace, then, while still pliable, pulled through a machine that shapes them into a strawlike tube. The end result looks a bit like a cocktail straw, although there are 20 sizes, each creating its own size of bead, and 20 basic colors that can be mixed into an almost endless selection of tones and shades, some opaque, some transparent. The holes in the straw can be round, triangular, star-shaped, even double-barreled, and a second color can be used to accent the hole or create baked-in glass patterns on the bead's face. The glass straws are sent through a slicing machine that bites off bead-size lengths, which are then reheated gently and put into a spinning machine that shapes the pliable glass into perfectly round beads that are then sorted and polished. ""And at the end of all that, all you have is one measly glass bead,"" Mr. Pus said. Leos Adler, Preciosa's bead production manager, set some sample boards on a conference room table. ""Our No. 1 market at the moment is India,"" he said. Beads are used there in Hindu ceremonial garb, but also in everyday products like the mangalsutra necklaces worn to signal that a woman is married. Preciosa sells directly to 70 countries and, through regional distributors, to 40 more. In Africa, the company sells to the Masai and Samburu tribes in Kenya and Tanzania, and to the Zulus, Xhosas, Ndebele and other tribes of southern Africa. ""You go to the Masai Mara and a lot of the beads you will see in the tourist markets are cheap Chinese products,"" Mr. Adler said. ""But the Masai themselves will only use our beads for their personal use."" In North America, the largest market is for home hobbyists, but several Native American tribes also purchase the beads for higher-end pieces aimed at collectors and flush tourists. Southern Sudan has also become a big market, Mr. Adler said. In South America, there are ceremonial garments for religious occasions, like childbirth ceremonies, as well as costumes for Carnival and an assortment of belts, napkin rings and jewelry for everyday use. The biggest surprise of recent years was an explosion of interest in Czech beads in Ukraine and Russia, where they were suddenly being used to adorn religious icons and paintings. ""It has become a huge market,"" Mr. Adler said. ""And it just happened."" One place the beads are not sold in large numbers is the Czech Republic. ""I only have one thing made out of beads at home,"" said Mr. Gyalog, the Preciosa supervisor. ""It's a bracelet."" Katerina Hruskova, assistant chief curator at the Museum of Glass and Jewelry in the nearby city of Jablonec nad Nisou, where an exhibition of Czech beadwork since 1700 had recently opened, said that was understandable. ""It is just a job for the people who live here,"" she said. ""If you are working eight hours or more every day with beads, you don't really want to go home and see beads."""
0,2016-01-13," Netflix is taking steps to dominate the world of digital streaming globally. Which other tech company does it most take after? For technology columnist Farhad Manjoo, the answer is Amazon. ""What if Netflix is the Amazon of the entertainment industry â the embodiment of a slow, expensive, high-risk effort to consume the entirety of your business?"" Mr. Manjoo writes in the State of the Art column, posing that question to media moguls. The parallels between Netflix and Amazon are striking, Mr. Manjoo says. Like Amazon, Netflix has the ability to surprise with a bold and no-holds-barred strategy, such as switching on its streaming service in more than 130 countries earlier this year. Netflix — similar to Amazon — is also spending huge sums to cement its business lead and is gathering mounds of data about users and their habits. As the company gains more consumers, more data and more content, that will push Netflix into a virtuous circle of profit and growth — just like you-know-who, Mr. Manjoo writes. More evidence of Netflix's Amazon-like qualities is likely to come next week. On Tuesday, Netflix will report its fourth-quarter results."
0,2016-01-14," Q. Is there a way to watch Amazon's Instant Video on my television instead of my tablet? If I'm subscribed to Amazon Prime in the United States, can I watch the Prime Instant Video outside the country, like when I'm traveling overseas for work? A. If you want to move the picture to a bigger screen, Amazon has a version of its video app available on several devices that connect to your television set in one way or another; you may already have the hardware on hand. A few inexpensive set-top boxes designed to stream video to the TV can tap into Amazon's video library, including the company's own Fire TV and Fire TV Stick devices. Hardware from Roku, TiVo and Panasonic can also stream Amazon Instant Video to the television screen. Game consoles like Microsoft's Xbox One and Xbox 360, Sony's PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 models, and the Nintendo Wii U and Wii can stream Amazon's video content to the connected TV screen. Smart TVs and Blu-ray disc players from several major manufacturers also have Amazon's app for videos built in. Although an official Amazon Video app has yet to arrive for the Apple TV, the company does make an iOS app for its streaming video service, and content from an iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad can be beamed to the television by way of Apple's AirPlay technology; some recent Mac laptops can stream content from the browser to the TV screen with AirPlay as well. Although Amazon Video does not officially support Google Chromecast, you might be able to stream video from Amazon's website on the Chrome browser to the TV-connected Chromecast device. As for watching Amazon Prime Instant Video when traveling beyond the United States, Amazon's Terms of Service states that you cannot use its video service outside the country because of restrictions from its content providers. But while legally streaming Amazon Video may be forbidden overseas, videos you fully download to your tablet from the site before you go can be viewed wherever you happen to be."
1,2016-01-14," Drones might get all the attention, but Amazon's interest in more traditional methods of moving things around is not slowing down. The retailer's China subsidiary has received United States approval to ship ocean freight for other companies. That could make it cheaper and easier for sellers on Amazon to move goods from Chinese factories to Amazon's American warehouses. Amazon's Federal Maritime Commission filing was noticed by Flexport, a logistics firm based in San Francisco. Amazon China could start ""cross-docking"" goods in United States ports ""for direct injection into Amazonâs courier network,"" Ryan Petersen, Flexport's chief executive, wrote on Thursday in a blog post. An Amazon spokesman declined to comment. Mr. Petersen noted that ocean freight does not cost much by itself these days â under $10 to ship a flat-screen TV across the Pacific. As a result, ""a considerable portion of logistics costs come through labor costs â particularly compliance and coordination of cargo handoffs between different players in the chain,"" he wrote. ""Itâs here that automation, something no traditional freight forwarding company can do even 1 percent as well as Amazon can, becomes the key competitive advantage over legacy freight forwarders."" Other recent moves by Amazon in the logistics space reportedly include acquiring the 75 percent of the French delivery company Colis PrivÃ© that it does not already own. It is also said to be negotiating for its own fleet of cargo planes. And Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, personally invested in Convoy, a start-up by an ex-Amazonian that books local and regional trucks on demand. Amazon wants to get people their purchases as fast as possible, but it also wants to shave some dollars off its shipping costs, said Jarrett Streebin, founder of EasyPost, a logistics company in San Francisco. ""Having their own fleet of planes will be a huge move,"" Mr. Streebin said. ""They would no longer need to spread out their more expensive inventory around the country or pay FedEx to get it somewhere by the next day. They could send it themselves from one hub."""
0,2016-01-15," When the Mexican actor Gael García Bernal won a Golden Globe last Sunday for his portrayal of an impetuous orchestra conductor in ""Mozart in the Jungle,"" television viewers were as stunned as he was. Even more so when the Amazon comedy about the fictional New York Symphony, directed by Paul Weitz, edged out contenders like ""Veep"" and ""Transparent"" for best comedy series. As the actor Albert Brooks put it on Twitter after it won its second Golden Globe, ""If Mozart in The Jungle wins any more awards someone will have to see it."" But maybe the rest of the world is just catching up with New York's classical music enclave. For the last year, the show has been the talk of symphony halls, conservatory corridors and orchestra pits, mostly because it is based on the 2005 memoir written by Blair Tindall, a former New York City freelance oboist whom many musicians know or have heard. In her tell-all, Ms. Tindall, now 55, chronicled cocaine-fueled late nights and freewheeling sexual high jinks among classical musicians in the 1980s and 1990s. The revelations were scandalous when published, in large part because the pseudonyms Ms. Tindall used barely veiled her paramours. She burned so many bridges then, it seemed the only people willing to embrace her worked in Hollywood. Producers agonized over whether the show would reflect the author's singular experience or embrace a more contemporary New York sensibility. They arrived at something in between: a whimsical drama exploring a competitive world. Musicians who have watched ""Mozart in the Jungle"" say it is slowly finding an audience here among the classical-music crowd, who have been drawn to the affable Mr. García Bernal and the 20-something oboist played by Lola Kirke, the sister of Jemima Kirke from ""Girls."" It doesn't hurt that Bernadette Peters, a Broadway favorite, also stars, as the orchestra's manager. The producers have hired New York musicians as on-screen extras, making for a fun peer-spotting exercise. The second season is studded with classical-world celebrity cameos, including musicians like Joshua Bell and Lang Lang, and the Grammy-winning pianist Emanuel Ax, who played the interactive video game ""Dance Dance Revolution"" at a dive bar during one episode. Gustavo Dudamel, the wunderkind Venezuelan conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, makes an appearance as a backstage handler. ""I've heard a lot of colleagues describe it as a guilty pleasure,"" said Lara St. John, a Canadian-born violinist who has played with many of the major symphony orchestras. ""But I don't see the guilt."" Ms. St. John has watched the show since its premiere in 2014 and said the overall story is compelling, despite a few artistic liberties. ""I too know people who do multiple gigs a night to make money,"" she said. ""And we all know people like Pembridge,"" referring to an egomaniacal former conductor played by Malcolm McDowell. But Ms. St. John conceded that she has the luxury of professional distance. ""I'm not familiar with the people in the book, so it doesn't bother me,"" she said. Jason Schwartzman, one of the show's producers, said it wasn't trying to recreate New York in the 1980s, nor were they aiming for a documentary about Ms. Tindall's life. AIDS had a sweeping impact on the Broadway community in that era. And drug use and casual sex were prevalent. ""Our show is not an adaptation, but the book is the touchstone for this whole thing,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""Blair's book was a moment when the sheen on classical music was lifted."" Marilyn Cole, a freelance oboist, was hired to train Ms. Kirke for her role as Hailey Rutledge, the New York City comer with dreams of joining a world-class orchestra. Ms. Cole, who has played in Broadway shows and numerous orchestras, said her primary concern was that the producers would portray her New York peers as petty and backbiting. They didn't. ""I came here and found an oboe community that is really a community,"" she said. She oversees Ms. Kirke's ""oboe playing"" on set. (With a few exceptions for credits and selected scenes, the music is from existing recordings that have been licensed.) And, as one might expect, oboe players are the most nitpicky about the actress's performance. ""A lot of the time they say she needs more of a roundness in the pursing of her lips,"" Ms. Cole said. ""But the comment I hear from non-oboists is that they are happy with her work."" Indeed, everyone has an opinion. Mr. Weitz grew up in New York City and heard from Orin O'Brien, a family friend who in 1966 was the first woman to become a member of the New York Philharmonic. ""She took me to task for all the swearing,"" he said, laughing. Ms. Tindall, who inspired Ms. Hailey's character, lives in Los Angeles and has had something of a colorful life outside the symphony hall. In 2007, her monthslong marriage to Bill Nye, better known as the Science Guy, was declared invalid. (The megachurch pastor Rick Warren had performed the ceremony the year earlier in front of 400 people at an entertainment conference.) Not long after, Mr. Nye filed a restraining order against her, claiming he caught her trying to poison his rose garden while clad in black clothes and a hat. Ms. Tindall said in a telephone interview that she was stressed at the time and never intended to harm Mr. Nye. Journalists critical of the show have also caused her tsoris. Last year, Ms. Tindall sparred online with Margaret Lyons, a television columnist from New York magazine, after Ms. Lyons tweeted that the oboe playing looked fake. ""It was an observation,"" Ms. Lyons said. ""The veracity of that kind of thing doesn't make or break a show."" Ms. Tindall also lashed out at Anne Midgette, the chief classical music critic for The Washington Post, who panned the book in a 2005 review in The New York Times, and described the first season as ""a seventh-grader's notion of what life in this business might be like."" ""I get really angry when people write something but don't come from a background where they know what they are talking about,"" said Ms. Tindall, noting that most critics are not professional musicians. Ms. Midgette, who is married to Greg Sandow, a critic and composer, declined to comment on the kerfuffle. Her review of the show's second season  was more favorable. ""I'm glad she likes it better,"" Ms. Tindall said. ""I hope she realizes now I'm not a monster."" But some musicians from the author's era have a hard time watching the show or have avoided it altogether. ""It is not that I hate Blair,"" said Randall Ellis, the principal oboist of the Mostly Mozart Festival. ""I just resent some of the things she wrote in the book."" He gave up, mostly, after the pilot, irked by a scene early on in which a cellist breezed in late for a performance. ""You either don't go into the pit or get fired the next day,"" he said. But Victoria Paterson, a violinist who worked on the show ""Smash"" and toured with Barbra Streisand, said she had seen several episodes of ""Mozart in the Jungle"" and liked it. ""The television show is so fleshed out,"" she said. ""Classical music isn't so nerdy."" She did take issue with some of Ms. Tindall's characterizations in the book, like one flute player she worked with on ""Phantom of the Opera."" ""Blair pooh-poohed her and made her look lame,"" Ms. Paterson said. ""But we don't see her that way."" But what galls her most are colleagues who suggest ""Mozart in the Jungle"" doesn't reflect their everyday lives. ""Of course it's not like that,"" Ms. Paterson said she told a friend. ""You have two kids and you are 40. You have to pick up your kids after school. No one is going to make a show about that."""
1,2016-01-15," Bets on the biggest purveyors of technology — companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft — powered three of the top-performing funds of the fourth quarter. The Fidelity OTC Portfolio, for example, can invest anywhere its manager, Gavin S. Baker, sees promise, but by charter, it tilts toward well-recognized growth companies trading on the Nasdaq. Apple was its biggest stake at the end of November, accounting for nearly 9 percent of the portfolio. Google's holding company, Alphabet, came in second, at nearly 8 percent. Mr. Baker, who has managed the fund since 2009, said he believed that the best companies combined top technology with burly brand names and large scale. Take Alphabet, he said. ""Not only does it have a great brand, but every day it does seven to eight times as many searches as all of its competitors combined. So every day its search accuracy is improving that much faster than competitors'."" As befits a growth investor, Mr. Baker is a technophile. He will riff at length about the technological themes that undergird his picks, like the omnipresence of cloud computing, the maturation of solar power and the promise of artificial intelligence. Skeptics complain the information age isn't yielding benefits comparable to the industrial revolution, but that is humbug, he says. ""The steam engine, to take advantage of that, you needed to dig canals and put in railroads. The peak change was 75 to 100 years after the invention."" As far as the microchip goes, he said, ""All of the infrastructure is in place, and we're entering the period of peak economic and social change."" Even video game makers are benefiting, he said. Consider Activision Blizzard, another top holding and the producer of Call of Duty and Guitar Hero. A decade ago, its market comprised a few million game consoles and personal computers, Mr. Baker said. ""Now you have a billion smartphones, all of which you can play a video game on."" And Activision Blizzard is trying to broaden its share of the mobile market with its pending acquisition of King Digital Entertainment, maker of the game Candy Crush. Mr. Baker's fund, with an expense ratio of 0.83 percent, returned 13.34 percent for the quarter, compared with 7.04 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. As its name suggests, the Value Line Larger Companies focused fund, managed by Cindy J. Starke, also banks on big outfits. Like Mr. Baker's fund, it lately held Apple, Alphabet and Activision Blizzard. Ms. Starke said she, too, believed in the power of brands, even when they weren't pre-eminently technology companies. ""Brands hold their value, and a global brand isn't dependent on one geography,"" she said. Estée Lauder, Starbucks and Nike were all among her fund's recent stakes. ""Their markets are growing because they address the whole world,"" she said. Sturdy brands also drew her to Constellation Brands, which owns the United States rights to popular Mexican beers like Corona, Modelo and Pacifico, as well as a groaning cellar of wines. ""In good times and bad, people still drink wine and beer,"" she said. Ms. Starke took over her fund about a year and a half ago. It then held more than 80 stocks. She set about paring that number, with an aim of keeping the portfolio at 30 to 50 holdings. ""In large-cap growth, it's hard to outperform with a big portfolio,"" she said. ""A concentrated portfolio is the way to do it."" With too many holdings, a fund can end up looking too much like the broader market and merely matching its return. She also plowed a greater portion of the fund's money into her top picks. Previously, the top 10 holdings accounted for about 14 percent of the portfolio, she said. Now they are more than 40 percent. The fund's biggest sector weightings are information technology, health care and consumer discretionary. Those tend to produce the best earnings growth, she said. ""I'm looking for healthy earnings growth and healthy sales growth,"" she said. Ms. Starke's fund, with an expense ratio of 1.12, returned 9.92 percent in the fourth quarter. Robert W. Kleinschmidt of the Tocqueville fund recently had some of the same recent top holdings as Mr. Baker and Ms. Starke. But he found them through a different — and longer — path. He calls himself a contrarian value investor and has been managing his offering since 1992. Like Mr. Baker's fund, it lately held shares of Microsoft. Mr. Kleinschmidt said the fund had owned the stock for about a decade, even as the company was seen as falling behind competitors like Apple and Google. But Microsoft kept putting up strong numbers, he said. ""Forget the name,"" he said. ""If I just gave you their market share, their cash flow, their return on equity, if I showed you all of that, would you be interested? Yes. Most people would be."" Facebook, an overlap with both Mr. Baker's and Ms. Starke's top holdings, is a more recent purchase. Mr. Kleinschmidt said he was attracted to the social network's enormous customer base, about 600 million people when the company went public in 2012. Tocqueville bought shares in the months after Facebook's initial public offering, when the stock sagged. ""I reasoned a smart management team would be able to figure out how to make money on 600 million users,"" Mr. Kleinschmidt said. Facebook says its network has grown and estimates more than a billion people use its service daily. Mr. Kleinschmidt has patience. As he has with Microsoft, he will stick with a stock for years. His fund's annual turnover ratio is 15 percent. In contrast, the average actively managed stock fund tracked by Morningstar turns over about two-thirds of its portfolio annually. ""One of the hardest things to do in this business — and yet one of the best things — can be to sit on your hands and not let the market's noise convince you that you have to do something,"" he said. Mr. Kleinschmidt cautioned that his turnover might increase in coming months. As a contrarian, he said he often finds buying opportunities when the market sags, as it has lately. ""The essence of a contrarian thinker is to lean against the wind. You do that by looking into situations where the prevailing feeling is, 'Oh, my God.'"" Mr. Kleinschmidt's fund, with an expense ratio of 1.25 percent, returned 10.97 percent in the fourth quarter."
2,2016-01-15," Walmart, whose supercenters once transformed the way Americans shop, announced on Friday that it would close a record number of stores in the United States and overseas, as it fights to hold its ground in a retail landscape under siege by the behemoth Amazon. The giant retailer, based in Bentonville, Ark., said in a statement that it would shutter 154 stores in the United States, or about 3 percent of its locations, as well as 115 stores overseas. It will also end its Walmart Express small-store format, which failed to catch on in urban areas. As many as 10,000 employees could lose their jobs in the United States and 6,000 elsewhere, it added. The closures underscore the turmoil faced by brick-and-mortar retail across a variety of fronts. Web merchants are gobbling up a growing share of shopping dollars, their vast online catalogs rendering Walmart's sprawling superstores increasingly less relevant. And consumers are spending less on traditional retail items like apparel. According to one estimate, Amazon accounted for almost a quarter of all retail sales growth last year. Other retail stalwarts, including Macy's, Sears and J. C. Penney, are also shuttering stores after a weak holiday sales season. ""Closing stores is never an easy decision, but it is necessary to keep the company strong and positioned for the future,"" Doug McMillon, Walmart's president and chief executive, said in a statement. ""It's important to remember that we'll open well more than 300 stores around the world next year,"" he said. ""So we are committed to growing, but we are being disciplined about it."" Mr. McMillon had warned investors late last year that the company was considering shifts in its retail strategy. At the higher end of its new plan to add 142 to 165 new stores, Walmart's store base in the United States would still rise; at the lower end, Walmart would, for the first time, shrink its United States footprint. The closings account for less than 1 percent of global square footage and revenue, which totaled $485 billion last year.  Walmart's exit from its smaller-format stores also highlights the difficulties it has faced in reaching more urban consumers. Introduced in 2011, its Express stores are slightly larger than a typical dollar store and were an effort to establish the retailer in bigger cities. But they have failed to make significant inroads or generate enough returns in the face of cutthroat competition from dollar stores and other discounters. Over all, Walmart has been slow to pull out of a flat sales period after the recession and was slow to react to the pace of growth in online shopping. Although sales have improved, the retailer has warned of lower profits going forward because of its investments in its work force and e-commerce. Over the last year, Walmart's stock has tumbled 30 percent to its lowest level in half a decade. Despite heavy spending on e-commerce initiatives, Walmart's online sales growth is slowing. ""Physical retail, and large box in particular, is at a tipping point,"" Richard Church, a retail analyst at the data analytics firm Discern, wrote in an email. ""There are too many stores in the U.S. across all retail sectors, low end to high end and everything in between,"" Mr. Church wrote. ""This is never more evident than when consumer demand is sluggish and decelerating, as it is now."" It is a difficult time for retailers over all. Though gas is cheap and the job market is strong, retail sales have struggled to gain any traction, falling  0.1 percent in December from the previous month, according to figures released by the Commerce Department on Friday. The National Retail Federation, an industry trade group, separately estimated that holiday sales rose just 3 percent from the previous year, below its projection of 3.7 percent growth. The tepid showing by consumers adds to worries among investors, already troubled by the market turmoil in China and elsewhere around the globe, that the recovery in the American economy remains fragile. There are bright spots in retail, like Lululemon Athletica, which raised its earnings outlook as it continued to ride a boom in athletics wear. L Brands, which owns Victoria's Secret, reported its ""best December ever"" after the lingerie brand generated holiday buzz with a star-studded fashion show. But heavyweights like Gap and Macy's reported dismal holiday sales as warm weather in much of the country hurt sales of winter clothing. And on Thursday, Best Buy said its winter had been disappointing so far; sales have been hurt by a lull in demand for smartphones and other consumer electronics despite heavy discounting. Noam Paransky, a director in the retail practice at the consulting firm AlixPartners, said that retailers were reaching the limits of competing on price, especially with online merchants eager to beat prices. Brick-and-mortar retailers needed to come up with a better proposition, he said, to lure shoppers into their stores. "" 'Stack it high and let it fly' doesn't work anymore,"" he said. ""They have to figure out how to make shopping fun again."" About 16,000 store employees will be affected worldwide by the closings, Walmart said. The stores are scheduled to shut down by the end of January. Walmart said it intended to transfer as many workers as it could to nearby stores and offer severance pay to those who do not find new positions. The company is the nation's largest private-sector employer. Workers' groups blasted Walmart's move. ""For Walmart, its workers are disposable,"" said Jess Levin, communications director at Making Change at Walmart, a group backed by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union and a longtime critic of working conditions at the retailer. ""These latest store closings could very well be just the beginning,"" she said. ""This sends a chilling message to the company's hard-working employees that they could be next."" Of the 154 locations Walmart will close in the United States, 102 will be Walmart Express stores. The company said it would focus more on the slightly larger Neighborhood Market format, which has logged stronger sales (though it will also close 23 of those stores). Walmart is also closing 12 supercenters and four Sam's Club membership stores. The bulk of Walmart's 115 closings overseas are in Brazil, where the economy is slowing. The retailer will also close 55 primarily small, loss-making stores in other Latin American markets, it said. The closures are expected by the end of the month. Walmart said that costs associated with the closings would shave an estimated 20 to 22 cents from its earnings per share, and that the effect would be felt mostly in its fourth-quarter results, which it reports next month. That effect is not reflected in its quarter or full-year earnings guidance."
0,2016-01-16," BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. — Rocking a pinstriped Paul Smith suit and boots that she had picked up in Paris, Eileen Myles rolled into the Golden Globes here last weekend on the arm of her girlfriend, Jill Soloway, the creator of the Amazon series ""Transparent,"" who was outfitted in a pink tuxedo and platform sneakers. Cool? The epitome. But talk about a ""dyke out of water,"" as Ms. Myles later described herself. At 66, she has spent the last four decades in the relative obscurity of punk poet-dom, publishing over 20 books of poetry, fiction and criticism, almost all with maverick presses. A generation of female writer-performers view her as indispensable. The rest of us: Eileen who? ""I'm a loudmouthed lesbian, which means mainstream invisible,"" she said. That is changing, though, and in many ways Ms. Myles — to her ecstatic bewilderment — has Hollywood to thank. First came ""Grandma,"" starring Lily Tomlin as Elle, an indomitable lesbian poet. The character was not overtly modeled on Ms. Myles, according to Paul Weitz, the film's writer-director. But her poetry is showcased. (When Mr. Weitz called to seek permission, the ever-blunt Ms. Myles recalled responding: ""Am I going to be some old lesbian sitting on the porch scratching her balls? Because that's kind of embarrassing."") The second season of ""Transparent,"" the acclaimed series about gender and sexual identity, arrived late last month, and Ms. Myles is all over it. Cherry Jones plays a poet based on her, her poetry is recited by various characters across multiple episodes, and Ms. Myles appears as an extra. ""The best thing @transparent_tv has done is made more people aware of @EileenMyles,"" the critic Ken Tucker wrote on Twitter. The timing was perfect: HarperCollins had just published her collection ""I Must Be Living Twice: New and Selected Poems 1975-2014"" and reissued ""Chelsea Girls,"" her out-of-print 1994 autobiographical novel, both of which generated strong reviews. As the books, movie and series started feeding one another, Ms. Myles finally started reaching the masses. (Well, maybe not Kardashian masses. But still.) ""It's real, and it's accidental,"" she told me at a coffee shop the afternoon after the Globes. ""You know, evolution is not an even process. There are surges, and there are micromoments. Certainly a career as an artist is that way."" She added of her current surge: ""I'm a little grateful, humble. And I'm excited to see what happens next. I keep being told: 'You need to capitalize on this. You've got to use it.' So I'm going to go sit in Texas — I have a house in Marfa — and try to decide what the most important thing is to do next."" The answer may involve a screenplay or series of her own. ""I have some ideas about there being a show that is even more about poets,"" she said. ""Poems, as eggs, should be put in larger baskets."" Adapting ""Chelsea Girls"" for the screen is another possibility, she said. The book recounts her childhood and then takes an alcohol-soaked ride through the East Village of New York in the 1980s. (Not in the book: Ms. Myles recalled how she and her girlfriend at the time planned to make art films, including one called 'Lavender Booties,' about two butch lesbians who are always crocheting. It was to be in black and white — except for the booties.) But Ms. Myles's new status as a Hollywood inside-outsider hasn't entirely softened her feelings about the entertainment business. She was still reeling from the Globes, which she described as ""a mild acid trip."" And a bad one, in some ways. She was incensed, for instance, about Ricky Gervais's monologue, which included a graphic joke about the genitalia of Jeffrey Tambor, who plays a transgender character on ""Transparent."" ""It was completely horrifying and such an incredible example of bullying,"" she said. ""The message was, 'Here, this is fun, this is what we serve first at our party.'"" She continued: ""But there's also a bright side, I guess. That kind of contempt, sexism and bullying is the squawks of a falling empire, which I think Hollywood is."" (Mr. Gervais, responding to an outcry that his monologue, including a joke about Caitlyn Jenner, was transphobic, said on Twitter: ""You have every right to be offended. Just don't cry when no one cares."") Ms. Myles met her girlfriend in May, when they were panelists at a museum event in San Francisco. Coincidentally, Ms. Soloway, 50, had been doing research on Ms. Myles, whom she had never met, because her ""Transparent"" writing staff had suggested modeling a character on her. ""Jill admitted later that she had this whole dossier on me,"" Ms. Myles said. ""It was cute and romantic."" Ms. Soloway, in a December profile in The New Yorker, said that, around that time, she had read one of Ms. Myles's journals, which had been purchased by the ""Transparent"" staff. ""I open it up, and the first thing it says is, 'Whoever falls in love with me is in trouble,'"" Ms. Soloway told the magazine. Asked what she meant by that, Ms. Myles broke into a goofy grin. ""It could also be true that anybody who falls in love with Jill is in trouble — deeply, deeply in trouble,"" she said, with a laugh. ""If you both have strong wills, you're always pushing the boundaries. Love is trouble, you know, which is one thing that is so great about it."" In an email, Ms. Soloway said: ""I see Eileen as a wayward walking country minister posing as a dyke poet. Her mind is the most expansive mind I've ever had the pleasure of being in contrast to. There is no thought or impulse of mine, be it revolutionary, feminist, radical, dirty, beautiful, silly, abstract or murderous, that feels ugly. That totally frees me up to say to myself: more, more, more."" In person, Ms. Myles was generous and engaging, even when I stumbled upon the occasional sore subject. For instance, I mentioned an article about her in The Boston Globe in which she was described as the New York poetry scene's ""godmother even before she was old enough to be a godmother."" Wrong thing to say. ""Godfather would be better,"" she said, a bit curtly. ""I ask my nephew to call me Uncle Eileen."" Ms. Myles continued: ""Gender is such a big issue today, but in so many micro ways. Here's an example. I wear my jeans low, and I continually get stopped at airports. The scans tell them I should be a man. The T.S.A. people call it a 'groin anomaly.' Can you believe that? ""One screener woman literally said to me, 'Do you have a penis?' And I answered, 'Were you seeing a penis on your monitor?' And she said, 'I'm asking you seriously: Do you have a penis?'"" (Ms. Myles's answer: ""Not today."") Ms. Myles grew up in blue-collar Arlington, Mass. Deciding in 1974 that she wanted to pursue a career in poetry, she moved to New York and became an assistant to James Schuyler, the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet. She seems to have done an impossibly enormous amount of living. She once toured the country in a minivan with an all-female poetry group called Sister Spit. She has conducted writing workshops in Mexico, taught at the University of California, San Diego, served as artistic director of the Poetry Project in New York and — oh, yeah — run for president; she campaigned as an ""openly female"" write-in candidate in 1991 and 1992, traveling to 28 states. ""Eileen is kind of like a gunslinger, with pretension as the enemy,"" Mr. Weitz said in a phone interview. She laughed at the image. ""You know, Jill and I wrote this document — I guess it's a manifesto — when we were in Paris that talks about how men should agree to stop writing books for 50 years, and men should stop making films for 100 years,"" she said. ""Extreme! But I think that movements only grow by hyperbole. It's not that we literally think it will happen or should happen or has to happen. But it has to be put out there. Because I want everything. I don't want delicate change — the chipping away slowly. Screw that."""
0,2016-01-19," We sat around my sisterâs dining room table, laughing so hard we had tears in our eyes, reliving and rehashing the events of the night before. My aunt and uncle âfishingâ for each other on the dance floor. My brotherâs hilarious toast to the bride and groom (my other brother). My cousinâs Russian girlfriend responding to someoneâs question of âWhere did he find you?â with âAmazon Prime.â  There is nothing like a wedding reception at a whiskey distillery to keep things entertaining. Since my husband, a Navy helicopter pilot, deployed in early October, moments like these have been rare. While I was surrounded by family, laughing with abandon, it felt as if he were simply in the next room watching the Chiefs game with some of the guys, instead of on a ship, somewhere in the Middle East.  As my aunt told a story, my newly turned 5-year-old climbed on my lap. She quietly slid my phone off the table, and asked in a whisper if she could look at pictures. I kissed her head and nodded as I laughed along with the other adults. Moments later, we were all interrupted as my daughter started to cry. Not sniffling. Iâm talking lose-your-mind-something-is-really-wrong-wailing-hysterically kind of cry. I looked down at my phone and saw what stared back at her: a âtoday in historyâ picture of my husband holding her in the hospital, his face full of the wonder and joy that new parenting brings.  âDaddy,â she said, sobbing. âI miss my daddy.â I scooped her up and carried her upstairs to a rocking chair to console her. My father (her Papa) and her cousin Finley came up to help soothe her, but she wasnât having it. âI donât want YOUR daddy,â she cried to me. âNot Finleyâs daddy, or Addieâs daddy, I want MY daddy.â Over, and over again she said it, until a funny video of her playing at the pool with my husband (accompanied by promises of doing that again soon) consoled her. Those 20 minutes felt like 20 years. Finally calm, we walked downstairs to find a quiet dining room, where the tears of laughter in everyoneâs eyes had quickly been replaced by ones of deep sympathy and palpable sadness. Later that night, once the children were asleep, I found my generally stoic brother (Addieâs daddy) in the basement, also in tears. As he wrapped his arms around me, he offered: âThis just seems so hard for you guys. Is it really worth it?â My husband and I started dating while he was in flight school; there has never been a version of us where he wasnât in the military. We've been together for 10 years, all of it colored by his service. Itâs easy to focus on the bad, the hard and the tragic that comes with being a military family. The missed birthdays, anniversaries, holidays. The back-to-back deployments. The pacing when the news reports a helicopter down, or sailors detained in Iran, and you havenât received an âIâm O.K.â message yet. The awful, guilt-ridden relief you experience when you learn that your spouse will come home to you and your two children, when you know there are others who wonât. The waiting, the praying, the wishing â no, itâs not worth it. Not even a little.  But those bad moments are just one piece of it. We've been to Japan, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Singapore and all over the world. We have visited places I had only read about. I stood on a stage in Pensacola, Fla., and pinned wings of gold to his uniform for the first time. One night in Guam, he gave me a flag that had flown over his base in Iraq and thanked me for loving and supporting him. We have made countless, incredible friends we never would have met without the Navy.  Even the hard parts  (like now) have their sweetness. A few days ago, my husband called our daughter on her birthday. Because he couldnât get her a gift this year, he said, he learned to play her favorite song on the ukulele. Thousands of miles away, as he sang, âI lava you,â she sat at the kitchen table, beaming from ear to ear. Years from now, our two children may remember how hard this deployment was for them. They may recall the heartache, the sadness and the occasional tears. I hope not. Instead, I hope they remember the joy they felt on Christmas when they found Santa left a âhugâ from Daddy (traced paper hands held together by ribbon) in their stockings. I hope they remember writing him love letters and looking forward to him coming home. I want them to remember the bedtime snuggles with me telling them goofy stories about their father that make them giggle. Iâll bet our 5-year-old always remembers the birthday her daddy called from his faraway ship, just to sing her a song. Is it worth it? I tell my brother Iâm not sure. But Iâm not sure I would have it any other way. "
0,2016-01-20," There's a little parlor game that people in Silicon Valley like to play. Let's call it, Who's Losing? There are currently four undisputed rulers of the consumer technology industry: Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, now a unit of a parent company called Alphabet. And there's one more, Microsoft, whose influence once looked on the wane, but which is now rebounding. So which of these five is losing? A year ago, it was Google that looked to be in a tough spot as its ad business appeared more vulnerable to Facebook's rise. Now, Google is looking up, and it's Apple, hit by rising worries about a slowdown in iPhone sales, that may be headed for some pain. Over the next couple of weeks, as these companies issue earnings that show how they finished 2015, the state of play may shift once more. But don't expect it to shift much. Asking ""who's losing?"" misses a larger truth about how thoroughly Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft now lord over all that happens in tech. Who's really losing? In the larger picture, none of them — not in comparison with the rest of the tech industry, the rest of the economy and certainly not in the influence each of them holds over our lives. Tech people like to picture their industry as a roiling sea of disruption, in which every winner is vulnerable to surprise attack from some novel, as-yet-unimagined foe. ""Someone, somewhere in a garage is gunning for us,"" Eric Schmidt, Alphabet's executive chairman, is fond of saying. But for much of the last half-decade, most of these five giants have enjoyed a remarkable reprieve from the bogeymen in the garage. And you can bet on them continuing to win. So I'm coining the name the Frightful Five. It's not just because I'm a Tarantino fan. By just about every measure worth collecting, these five American consumer technology companies are getting larger, more entrenched in their own sectors, more powerful in new sectors and better insulated against surprising competition from upstarts. Though competition between the five remains fierce — and each year, a few of them seem up and a few down — it's becoming harder to picture how any one of them, let alone two or three, may cede their growing clout in every aspect of American business and society. ""The Big Five came along at a perfect time to roll up the user base,"" said Geoffrey G. Parker, a business professor at Tulane University and the co-author of ""Platform Revolution,"" a forthcoming book that explains some of the reasons these businesses may continue their dominance. ""These five rode that perfect wave of technological change — an incredible decrease in the cost of I.T., much more network connectivity and the rise of mobile phones. Those three things came together, and there they were, perfectly poised to grow and take advantage of the change.""  Mr. Parker notes the Big Five's power does not necessarily prevent newer tech companies from becoming huge. Uber might upend the transportation industry, Airbnb could rule hospitality and, as I argued last week, Netflix is bent on consuming the entertainment business. But if such new giants do come along, they're likely to stand alongside today's Big Five, not replace them. Indeed, the Frightful Five are so well protected against start-ups that in most situations, the rise of new companies only solidifies their lead. Consider that Netflix hosts its movies on Amazon's cloud, and Google's venture capital arm has a huge investment in Uber. Or consider all the in-app payments that Apple and Google get from their app stores, and all the marketing dollars that Google and Facebook reap from start-ups looking to get you to download their stuff. This gets to the core of the Frightful Five's indomitability. They have each built several enormous technologies that are central to just about everything we do with computers. In tech jargon, they own many of the world's most valuable ""platforms"" — the basic building blocks on which every other business, even would-be competitors, depend. These platforms are inescapable; you may opt out of one or two of them, but together, they form a gilded mesh blanketing the entire economy. The Big Five's platforms span so-called old tech — Windows is still the king of desktops, Google rules web search — and new tech, with Google and Apple controlling mobile phone operating systems and the apps that run on them; Facebook and Google controlling the Internet advertising business; and Amazon, Microsoft and Google controlling the cloud infrastructure on which many start-ups run. Amazon has a shopping and shipping infrastructure that is becoming central to  retailing, while Facebook keeps amassing greater power in that most fundamental of platforms: human social relationships. Many of these platforms generate what economists call ""network effects"" — as more people use them, they keep getting more indispensable. Why do you chat using Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp, also owned by Facebook? Because that's where everyone else is. Their platforms also give each of the five an enormous advantage when pursuing new markets. Look how Apple's late-to-market subscription streaming music service managed to attract 10 million subscribers in its first six months of operation, or how Facebook leveraged the popularity of its main app to push users to download its stand-alone Messenger app. Then there's the data buried in the platforms, also a rich source for new business. This can happen directly — for instance, Google can tap everything it learns about how we use our phones to create an artificial intelligence engine that improves our phones — and in more circuitous ways. By watching what's popular in its app store, Apple can get insight into what features to add to the iPhone. ""In a way, a lot of the research and development costs are being borne by companies out of their four walls, which allows them to do better product development,"" Mr. Parker said. This explains why these companies' visions are so expansive. In various small and large ways, the Frightful Five are pushing into the news and entertainment industries; they're making waves in health care and finance; they're building cars, drones, robots and immersive virtual-reality worlds. Why do all this? Because their platforms — the users, the data and all the money they generate — make these far-flung realms seem within their grasp. Which isn't to say these companies can't die. Not long ago people thought IBM, Cisco Systems, Intel and Oracle were unbeatable in tech; they're all still large companies, but they're far less influential than they once were. And a skeptic might come up with significant threats to the five giants. One possibility might be growing competition from abroad, especially Chinese hardware and software companies that are amassing equally important platforms. Then there's the threat of regulation or other forms of government intervention. European regulators are already pursuing several of the Frightful Five on antitrust and privacy grounds. Even with these difficulties, it's unclear if the larger dynamic may change much. Let's say that Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce company, eclipses Amazon's retail business in India — well, O.K., so then it satisfies itself with the rest of the world. Government intervention often limits one giant in favor of another: If the European Commission decides to fight Android on antitrust grounds, Apple and Microsoft could be the beneficiaries. When the Justice Department charged Apple with orchestrating a conspiracy to raise e-book prices, who won? Amazon. So get used to these five. Based on their stock prices this month, the giants are among the top 10 most valuable American companies of any kind. Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft are the top three; Facebook is No. 7, and Amazon is No. 9. Wall Street gives each high marks for management; and three of them — Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook — are controlled by founders who don't have to bow to the whims of potential activist investors. So who's losing? Not one of them, not anytime soon."
1,2016-01-20," ""American men, you love to fight,"" a supporting female character observes in the very male dark-comic thriller ""Mad Dogs,"" whose 10-episode first season debuts Friday on Amazon Prime. She's not wrong, as judged by television's continuing fascination with middle-aged male bellicosity. In HBO's coming ""Vinyl,"" testosterone and cocaine fuel a 1970s record executive through a midlife and career crisis. Showtime's Wall Street drama, ""Billions,"" treats money as expression of male potency; it's a show so macho that its alpha-dog hedge-fund wizard, Axe, shares a name with a body spray. In ""Mad Dogs,"" male angst goes on holiday. Four American men travel to Belize to visit a wealthy college pal, Milo (Billy Zane), for a 40-somethings-gone-wild getaway at his lavish oceanside villa. There's an aggressive edge to his invite, a determination to show how much better he's done than his friends: the cautious financial planner Cobi (Steve Zahn), the irresponsible Lex (Michael Imperioli), the family man Gus (Romany Malco) and the embittered Joel (Ben Chaplin). Milo has done well, but he hasn't done much good. His money comes from underworld connections, and his guests are soon drafted into a feud between him and a local crime lord. A bit like Billy Bob Thornton's Lorne Malvo in Season 1 of ""Fargo,"" Milo is an instigator, goading his friends into joining him to prove that they're still men. ""Where's the fire in your belly?"" he demands. It's a familiar theme, but thrillingly executed in the early going. Suddenly our soft American friends find themselves stuck in Belize with a stolen boat, a trove of illicit cash, numerous deadly enemies — and a couple decades' worth of interpersonal resentments coming out under the pressure. Cris Cole, working with Shawn Ryan (""The Shield""), adapted the series from Mr. Cole's British drama of the same name. The implicit ""… and Englishmen"" is lost in the Americanized version. But there's still plenty of midday sun. ""Mad Dogs"" is all blinding jewel tones, painting its setting as both gorgeous and alienating. Everywhere there are wild animals and menacing locals, underscoring the old theme of overcivilized characters confronting their atavistic core in the booga-booga tropics. Gus picks up on this directly: Milo, he says, ""went all Col. Kurtz"" in Belize. (That Gus is black at least complicates all the cultural othering going on here; at another point, he reminds Lex that Belize is not ""white man's America."") The horror (the horror!) begins soon enough. ""Mad Dogs"" starts off strong and constantly accelerating, driven by a frantically percussive soundtrack. It has a fine, macabre sense of humor, and the performances are strong from top to bottom. Mr. Malco, known for comic roles (""The 40-Year-Old Virgin""), is especially good as a suburban dad in extremis. Like many streaming series, though, it seems to be marking time in the middle (Amazon previewed six of 10 episodes for critics), as the characters try to escape Belize and the plot tosses them among so many frying pans and fires that the whole thing threatens to overcook. The strongest parts of these episodes come in the downtime, when the friends are thrown together in close quarters and reflect on their lives, their resentments and, of course, what it means to be a man. One idea they debate, at a dark moment, is the notion that, at the end of life, women regret things they have done and men regret things they haven't. There's no woman present to verify this theory — it's a refreshing change, in fact, when Allison Tolman (""Fargo"") turns up midseason to offer a counter-perspective. Exotic in its looks but predictable in its themes, ""Mad Dogs"" journeys into the heart of darkness and finds a man cave."
0,2016-01-22," Pegi Vail, 53, an anthropologist and the associate director of the Center for Media, Culture and History at New York University, studies backpacker subculture and the impact of travel on communities and on biodiversity. Her documentary, ""Gringo Trails,"" has been shown at dozens of festivals and in more than 20 countries since 2014, and recently was released on DVD (it is also available on iTunes and Amazon Video). Here are edited excerpts from an interview with her. Q. Why the focus on backpacker culture? A. I backpacked throughout my 20s. My first trip was to Europe, and I got inspired to do more. I went through China, Southeast Asia, Africa. For a young traveler on a budget, backpacking offered the possibility of more immersion, or so I thought. It did to a certain point, because you go to smaller villages, use local transportation. When I went to graduate school for anthropology, I decided to study my own tribe.  Describe a typical backpacker then and now. Most are still in their 20s, equally male and female and even if they're on a shoestring, the majority are from middle- to middle-upperclass families. However, the racial and ethnic profiles have changed with the education and income levels in different countries. So now there are many more travelers from Asia, Brazil, Russia and India. And they're using social media as much as, if not more than, Lonely Planet. That element of being connected, among themselves and to people back home, is the biggest change. You begin your film with the story of Yossi Ghinsberg, who in 1981 was lost in the Bolivian jungle for a month. His book about his adventures sparked a boom in backpacker travel to the town of Rurrenabaque. Your film showed how locals created canned adventures for the travelers who poured in. That's a very typical example of what can happen. In the case of Rurrenabaque, there aren't any policies that limit the numbers. Communities really need to plan ahead or at least react quickly to save their cultural and environmental resources. Your most jarring example of backpacker tourism run amok was Haad Rin, a town on the Thai island of Ko Pha Ngan, which went from a little-known beach to a giant party place, famous for its full-moon parties. What is the situation now? I was there in 1987. There were just a few huts to stay in, and in my youthful notions of paradise, that was it. Back then, it was really chill and beautiful. Now it's mostly buildings. I went after another backpacker told me about it, so of course I was part of that process. It keeps growing and now they have half-moon and quarter-moon parties. One example you show of tourism done right is the Chalalán Ecolodge in Bolivia, a natural and cultural immersion experience that Mr. Ghinsberg helped create. As one of the first community tourism businesses in the country it's commendable, but a two-night, three-day package there costs $800 for two people. Do backpackers partake? Chalalán is a great example because the people there have really become stewards of their own land and culture. We actually saw a number of backpackers who had decided to splurge at Chalalán; also, you can often get cheaper rates when you sign up in person. It's really about the things people value. Some backpackers don't blink about spending tons on beer."
0,2016-01-24," This week's quarterly earnings announcements will include results from three of the technology sector's most important companies: Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. Investors on Tuesday will try to divine from Apple's numbers just how quickly the company's growth is decelerating. Their focus will be on iPhone sales. On Thursday, Microsoft and Amazon investors will want to see strong growth in both companies' computing services businesses. Although Microsoft is an important software maker and Amazon is one the world's most successful e-commerce businesses, those companies also run two of the largest cloud services companies, selling remote computing services and information storage. —Katie Benner The Federal Reserve always planned to pause after raising interest rates in December for the first time since the financial crisis. The looming question as Fed officials gather on Tuesday and Wednesday for their first policy-making meeting of 2016 is how long that pause will last. Investors initially expected that the Fed would raise rates again at its second meeting of 2016, in March. But the downturn in equity markets, the rise of the dollar and the continued weakness of inflation have led some analysts to predict that the Fed may wait months before moving again. The Fed has a chance to update its economic outlook and its plans in the statement it will issue after the two-day meeting. —Binyamin Appelbaum Banco Santander of Spain will report its full-year results on Wednesday as earnings season kicks off for Europe's largest banks. In a surprise announcement last week, Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest lender, reported an annual loss of 6.7 billion euros, or about $7.2 billion, as it took a charge of €1.2 billion in the fourth quarter because of legal issues. Deutsche Bank is expected to discuss its full-year results in more detail at a news conference on Thursday. —Chad Bray A campaign against corporate tax avoidance picks up again on Wednesday when the European Commission expects to propose plans to remove six loopholes, which various European Union governments offer to companies and subsidiaries. The initiative is meant to complement a separate effort to stop Ireland, Luxembourg and other governments from striking favorable deals with individual companies like Apple and Amazon. The plans, set to be unveiled on Wednesday, are part of a legislative package that would require unanimous approval by the European Union's 28 governments. But commission officials say they are optimistic about eventual approval because many governments need the revenue to support their budgets. —James Kanter Royal Dutch Shell's chief executive, Ben van Beurden, above, faces a crucial test this week when his proposed acquisition of BG Group, the British oil and gas producer, for about $45 billion will be put to both companies' shareholders. Shell shareholders are expected to vote on Wednesday, and BG's on Thursday. Some investors have been skeptical about Shell going ahead with a big acquisition at a time of falling oil prices, but big shareholders like the Norway oil fund are supporting the deal. —Stanley Reed On Thursday morning, the Commerce Department will report the latest data on durable goods orders for December. Always volatile, overall durable goods orders are expected to decline by 0.5 percentage points on lower aircraft orders. Core demand, which excludes this factor, is expected to be flat, in line with November data. If the numbers are weaker, it would suggest that the manufacturing sector remained under pressure from a stronger dollar and weakness in major export markets like China and Europe. —Nelson D. Schwartz The Japanese central bank will decide on Friday whether to expand its economic stimulus program, under which it pumps trillions of yen into financial markets each month to keep interest rates low and to counter consumer-price deflation. Recent volatility in stock and currency markets has increased speculation that the bank, the Bank of Japan, could take action, though most analysts believe it will hold off for now. An upswing in the yen's exchange rate has been especially worrying for the Japanese authorities: A stronger currency tends to promote deflation and weaken profits in crucial export industries like cars and electronics. —Jonathan Soble The Commerce Department on Friday morning will release its initial estimate of economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2015. In recent weeks, the estimate for the growth rate in the gross domestic product for the period has fallen to about 0.8 percent from nearly 2 percent amid signs of weakness late last year, including lackluster retail sales. The consensus calls for an 0.8 percent rise, but some forecasters think the figure could come in well below that, or even show a contraction in the period. If that happens, it would lower the average rate for growth for all of last year to well under 2 percent. —Nelson D. Schwartz American and European negotiators have until Sunday to reach a new trans-Atlantic data-sharing deal after the current pact was invalidated late last year. Thousands of companies, including tech giants like Facebook and nontech businesses like Pfizer, had relied on the so-called safe harbor agreement to run their daily operations. But because of bickering over how American intelligence agencies have access to Europeans' data, a new agreement looks increasingly unlikely to be approved by Sunday. —Mark Scott"
0,2016-01-26," PARK CITY, Utah — It was the independent film equivalent of a crack of thunder. After its Sundance premiere on Saturday, ""Manchester by the Sea,"" a buzzy drama starring Casey Affleck as a handyman coping with family strife, sold not to a traditional studio distributor but to a streaming service. Amazon paid a hefty $10 million for the movie, beating out the likes of Fox and Universal. After years of dipping their toes into the Sundance water — picking up a documentary here, making an unsuccessful bid for a narrative film there — the big streaming services this time around are driving the deal-making. Halfway through the 11-day festival, which started on Thursday, Amazon had bought four films. Netflix had snapped up three and was chasing several more. Most traditional distributors had yet to buy anything. ""We're interested in distinctive films by artists who have something new and interesting to say,"" said Roy Price, head of Amazon Studios. The streaming service shopping spree does not just reflect the ability of these deep-pocketed insurgents to outspend the entrenched studios. Filmmakers, once dismissive of streaming companies, have been looking at the struggling art-house box office and deciding that getting their work seen by the widest possible audience — while being handsomely paid, of course — may be what matters most. ""You always want your film to be shown on a big screen with perfect sound and the best projection,"" said Sian Heder, who wrote and directed ""Tallulah,"" a comedic drama that had its premiere here on Saturday and sold to Netflix for about $5 million. ""But that's not always the reality anymore. The way that people consume media is changing."" Netflix, focused on building a global streaming catalog, is not especially interested in theatrical releases, even though it will sometimes put films in a few theaters to qualify them for awards. Cary Fukunaga's ""Beasts of No Nation,"" for instance, was simultaneously released in October on Netflix and in 31 theaters. (To the displeasure of Mr. Fukunaga, the film, while successful on Netflix, flopped badly in theaters, taking in $90,777.) In contrast, Amazon is trying to make inroads with filmmakers — in particular those with an eye toward the Oscars, including Kenneth Lonergan, the writer-director behind ""Manchester by the Sea"" — by approaching the independent film business much like a traditional distributor. ""For every movie that we do, we want as robust a theatrical run as the film will support,"" Mr. Price said. In other words, Mr. Price's Sundance purchases will arrive on the Amazon Prime streaming platform only after playing in theaters (for varying periods). In addition to buying ""Tallulah,"" which stars Ellen Page and Allison Janney, Netflix paid $7 million for the global streaming rights to ""The Fundamentals of Caring,"" a Sundance road movie starring Paul Rudd, Craig Roberts and Selena Gomez. Other Netflix purchases include ""Under the Shadow,"" a horror movie set in Iran. ""We're in the market for enjoyable films that have a great creative vision and that we can show to our members in 190 countries,"" said Jonathan Friedland, Netflix's chief communications officer. Also going home with Amazon from Sundance is the documentary ""Author: The JT LeRoy Story,"" about a mysterious writer whose identity shocked the literary world; it cost about $1 million to acquire, or roughly double what some distributors were willing to pay. Amazon also bought ""Complete Unknown,"" starring Rachel Weisz as a mysterious dinner guest, for a little more than $2 million, and ""Love & Friendship,"" a period drama based on a Jane Austen novella, for about $2 million. Roadside Attractions, co-founded by Howard Cohen and Eric d'Arbeloff, will work with Amazon to distribute ""Love & Friendship"" in theaters. ""The theatrical model continues to have a lot of value, especially because it means something to viewers when films play in theaters,"" Mr. Cohen said.  In his view, releasing films simultaneously in theaters and on video-on-demand platforms, streaming or otherwise, leaves consumers with a bad impression. ""It has somehow become a signal that the movie isn't any good,"" he said. A decade ago, before the digital entertainment boom vastly expanded viewing options, independent films were routinely able to break through in theaters. ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" for instance, bought at Sundance in 2006 by Fox Searchlight, collected about $70 million at theaters in North America, after adjusting for inflation. At its widest release, the movie played in 1,602 locations. But smaller films today are having a more difficult time selling tickets. Now, a movie like ""Brooklyn"" is considered a success. Fox Searchlight bought it at Sundance last year and it has taken in about $27.5 million since its release in November, playing in 906 theaters at its peak. Of the films sold at Sundance in 2015, only a handful took in more than $1 million at the domestic box office. As a result, some sales agents say, traditional distributors are being more selective at Sundance. ""Every year we have a little bit of that syndrome,"" said Jessica Lacy, head of independent and international film at ICM Partners. ""This time around, the breakout potential of some films in the lineup is not as obvious. That can be challenging for a traditional studio as it tries to figure out what deals make sense."" Ms. Lacy continued, ""That said, there are still quite a few promising films to debut."" A premiere is scheduled on Tuesday, for instance, for ""The Intervention,"" about a fumbled attempt by a group of friends to halt a marriage. Traditional buyers have not been sidelined entirely. As of midday Monday, Sony Pictures Classics had purchased ""Equity,"" a female-focused Wall Street thriller starring Anna Gunn, and a documentary called ""Eat That Question — Frank Zappa in His Own Words."" Lionsgate, through its Summit label, paid an estimated $2.5 million for ""Indignation,"" an adaptation of a Philip Roth novel. ""The market is a bit slower this year than last, but that is also because filmmaker teams have to sort through more options and decide what's most important to them,"" said Paul Davidson, senior vice president for film and television at the Orchard, an entertainment company known for movies like ""Cartel Land,"" an Oscar-nominated documentary.  ""For some, it's the largest check,"" Mr. Davidson said. ""For some, it's a real theatrical release."""
1,2016-01-26," For his first foray into streaming television, Woody Allen is relying on one of his tried and true formulas — casting an attention-grabbing young actress alongside himself. In this case, Miley Cyrus, the former Disney kid turned outré pop star, will appear in his coming streaming series for Amazon. The as-of-now untitled project, which is set in the 1960s, will also star Elaine May and Mr. Allen for a scheduled run of six half-hour episodes in 2016. Deadline first reported the casting news, which was confirmed by someone with knowledge of the show. Ms. Cyrus confirmed her role on Instagram, displaying a portrait of Mr. Allen that she said has been beside her bed for years. ""I was looking into his eyes when I got the call to be a part of the cast,"" she wrote, adding expletives and five unicorn emojis to convey her excitement. Last year, Ms. Cyrus returned to public view after a period of professional dormancy to host the MTV Video Music Awards, stoking controversy with her seemingly unfiltered comments and flamboyant outfits. At the close of the broadcast, she released an album, ""Miley Cyrus and Her Dead Petz,"" which she had recorded secretly, and without the participation of her record label. As an actress, she previously starred in Disney's ""Hannah Montana"" for four seasons, along with films like ""The Last Song"" and ""LOL."" She also appeared as herself in last year's ""A Very Murray Christmas"" and ""The Night Before."" Amazon announced in January 2015 that it had signed Mr. Allen to write and direct his first television show, adding to its growing stable of original programming that includes the Golden Globe winners ""Transparent"" and ""Mozart in the Jungle."" Mr. Allen quickly turned self-deprecating about the deal after it was made public. ""It was a catastrophic mistake for me,"" he told reporters at Cannes in May. ""I don't even know what a streaming service is,"" he elaborated in an interview with Deadline at the time. ""I never knew what Amazon was."" ""Amazon kept coming to me and saying, please do this, whatever you want,"" he continued. ""Well, this went on for a year and a half, and they kept making a better deal and a better deal. Finally they said look, we'll do anything that you want, just give us six half hours."" He added, ""I have regretted every second since I said O.K."""
0,2016-01-27," In the second season of ""Transparent,"" a quick scene gave me one of the most ecstatic highs I've had watching almost anything recently. ""Transparent"" is Jill Soloway's comedy on Amazon, which is loosely — and too narrowly — described as the awakening of Maura Pfefferman (Jeffrey Tambor), a 70-year-old transgender woman in Los Angeles. And it spoils nothing to say that at the end of this eighth episode, Maura has guilted her two bisexual but radically different adult daughters, Sarah (Amy Landecker) and Ali (Gaby Hoffman), into bringing her along to a women's — excuse me, ""womyn's"" — music festival. Before you even see them in Sarah's speeding minivan, you can hear guitars strumming on the soundtrack. And if you recognize the song, you have to laugh at the sheer of-courseness of the choice: ""Closer to Fine,"" the Indigo Girls' 1989 coffeehouse spiritual. It's so obvious in its earnestness, the musicians so perfect in their brand of feminist existentialism, that playing it is not just on the nose — it's on the entire face. This is practically the womyn's festival theme song. You're supposed to laugh, and I did. Ali and Sarah scream the lyrics — ""There's more than one answer to these questions/Pointing me in a crooked line/And the less I seek my source for some definitive/Closer I am to fine"" — while Maura, from the back seat, clutches a bag of Popchips, her long body stretched so that her big, bare feet are riding shotgun, and tries to mumble along. Maura has probably never heard ""Closer to Fine,"" or rolled her eyes if she has. But now she's so desperate to have a girls' weekend that she's willing to be swept up in a liberation anthem she doesn't even know. At this awkward point in her nascent womyn-hood, she's all feet. The whole scene should be the height of embarrassment: two grown women rocking out to folk music in a suburban car with their earth-mother ""Moppa."" The song rolls into the credits, which on boutique cable and streaming shows typically feature a pop song that sums up, with a wink of irony, the last shot or the mood of the entire episode. It's music that doesn't so much tell you how to feel as much as it tells you how the show feels: cool. But what makes this scene transcendent is the proud reclamation of the uncool, of obviousness. It clears out all of the self-conscious noise of being cool and concentrates instead on being free. And without exactly realizing it, I was also free. I was in the grip of an emotional force, of an exhilaration that has taken decades to come back to popular culture and now feels profoundly, perhaps inexorably, here. Presently, the beautiful mess of what it means to be alive, what it means to be human, is being staged almost entirely within the realm of women's sexuality. ""Transparent"" is a specific yet galactic conjuring of female energy, as strong as I've felt and seen anywhere, from any screen lately. And given what else is out there, that's something: For starters, ""Orange Is the New Black,"" ""Being Mary Jane,"" ""Broad City,"" ""UnREAL,"" ""Inside Amy Schumer,"" ""Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"" ""Jane the Virgin,"" ""Girls,"" ""Younger,"" ""PBS NewsHour"" (have you seen Judy and Gwen?). None of these shows argue anything essentialist or supremacist about women. Women are just simply — yet never only simply — at the center of their own adventures. The improvement isn't a matter of occupation; many of the women in these shows don't have one. It's a matter of behavior. These are messed-up, funny, unhappy, vulnerable, yet indomitable, people. They can feel anything and everything. So, by extension, can you. Then, at the movies, there's ""Carol,"" Todd Haynes's lesbian romance, which is hampered by its sense of discretion. In Mr. Haynes's film, set in the early 1950s, a strapping, affluent housewife named Carol Aird (Cate Blanchett) locks eyes across a busy Manhattan department store with a petite cashier named Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara). They fall for each other, hit the road and have a less blissful time in Carol's car than the Pfeffermans do in theirs. Carol and Therese are ruing the consequences of their love, fleeing the hurt of a morality clause in a legal judgment that, under the circumstances, sounds more horrific: morality claws. In discovering Therese, Carol stands to lose custody of her daughter, Rindy. Working from an adaptation by Phyllis Nagy of Patricia Highsmith's 1952 novel, ""The Price of Salt,"" Mr. Haynes is back in the mannerist mode of another of his period studies of sexual awakening and repression, the crest of which is ""Far From Heaven"" from 2002, a masterly conflation of film history and feminist tragedy. This time, he's just as interested in sexuality and the cinematic past. But where in ""Far From Heaven"" his strategy was to unpack and reveal, with ""Carol,"" he has decided to conceal. The camera obscures its two women in the glare of windshields and windows. You see the backs of their heads almost as frequently as you see their faces. ""Keep this room orderly,"" reads a sign in the staff cafeteria at Therese's department store, and on that front Mr. Haynes's doesn't disappoint. This is a work of respectful restraint. The film's lone sex scene is shot in part from abstracting angles and fades into a writhing blur. The weather is so gray and wet that ""rindy"" also might describe the film's look. This movie is the opposite side of transparent. It's opaque. That's on purpose, too. Mr. Haynes is a semiotician. He values the meaning of signs. This makes him fully aware of what, for instance, it means for a man with a camera to look at women. He's surely familiar with Laura Mulvey's essay ""Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema,"" the cultural-theory landmark that had its 40th anniversary last year, still reads like gospel and, in its timelessness, still thrills. In it, Ms. Mulvey deploys psychoanalysis to identify, interpret and condemn the patriarchal misogyny and homophobia in the movies' marrow. Her critique of the ""male gaze"" is so convincing that once you see things her way, there's no unseeing them. Mr. Haynes's movie works best, for me, on Ms. Mulvey's terms. Can a man — even a gay man, like Mr. Haynes — have a female gaze? Should he? The way he and Ms. Nagy present it, lesbianism obviates a male gaze. Therese turns to leave a record shop and notices a pair of women, standing intimately close, noticing her. The movie makes her a photographer, and many of her early pictures are of Carol, which means we're watching a romance about, among other things, a woman watching a woman. That shouldn't be intriguing; it's not even new. (There's Lisa Cholodenko's ""High Art"" from 1998, for one thing.) And yet it is. Ms. Soloway and her collaborators (including many lesbians, trans and cisgender women) also seem acutely aware of the implications of all that gazing. But Ms. Soloway's show seems allergic to the tentative politeness of Mr. Haynes's artistry. Dreamy flashbacks to Maura's mother and grandmother in Weimar Berlin, with their strategic inattention to language, accents and period accuracy, feel vividly like now. In the Dec. 14th issue of The New Yorker, Ariel Levy dropped in on planet Soloway and wove a report of the preciousness, eccentricity, academia and pre-emptive, presumptive femaleness that fuels the creation of the show. All the waves of feminism and queer theory seemed to have Ms. Levy questioning, understandably, whether to put on a wet suit. But to the extent that activist ideology operates within the actual show, it's presented as unsettled and up for debate. Ali's exploratory, politicized lesbianism offends her more traditional girlfriend (Carrie Brownstein, who also shows up for a minute in ""Carol"") and amuses the roving, rapacious Sarah, who, while stewing in a sauna, basically says that she couldn't care less about the patriarchy. The show makes it look easy to not care less, even though caring is a key to why ""Transparent"" works so powerfully. Like any good drama, it keeps inventing problems for itself to solve, in matters of religion, Jewishness, class and snobbery (though not so much on race — not yet). The show is a whirlpool, pulling in characters from other places and other eras, subtly psychologizing their behavior and revelations. The farther out it spins — juxtaposing the present and the past; history and ""herstory"" — the stronger it seems to get. Mr. Haynes, by contrast, has built an island for two. His lesbians are ambiguously adrift in some queer, icy before that makes you wonder if they'll experience — or help instigate — a version of Ms. Soloway's emphatically self-actualized after."
1,2016-01-27," Nearly a decade ago, Frank P. Quattrone, the star investment banker who took Amazon and Cisco Systems public in the 1990s, returned to the deal scene with a boutique investment bank catering to Silicon Valley. After re-emerging as a major force in the technology industry, Mr. Quattrone is now yielding day-to-day management to one of his top lieutenants. His firm, the Qatalyst Group, announced on Wednesday that George Boutros would take over as chief executive, overseeing overall management. The appointment is the first major leadership change at Qatalyst since Mr. Quattrone, 60, began the firm in March 2008, seven months after clearing his name in a bitter legal fight with the federal government. A veteran of Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse, Mr. Quattrone became known as a banker of choice for the dot-com boom. Yet he was waylaid by charges of hindering a government investigation into initial public offerings at Credit Suisse. Those charges were dropped in 2007. Instead of decamping to an investment firm, Mr. Quattrone chose instead to set up a boutique investment bank. It is a niche that has gained prominence in recent years, as firms like Centerview Partners, PJT Partners and Evercore Partners have secured roles on some of the biggest deals around. Since 2008, Qatalyst has grown from three employees to 53, and it says it has advised on more than 90 deals, including the sales of OpenTable, Motorola Mobility and Dropcam. Naming Mr. Boutros, 55, chief executive is a promotion that formally recognizes the role that the banker — who has worked with Mr. Quattrone since 1992 — has been playing at Qatalyst. ""George is one of the most experienced and accomplished M.&A. advisers on the planet,"" Mr. Quattrone said in a statement. ""He is very highly regarded by both our clients and team members at all levels, and I am confident that his leadership will propel Qatalyst to exciting new heights in the years ahead."" Mr. Quattrone will become executive chairman and focus on strategy. Other bankers at Qatalyst received promotions as well, including Jason DiLullo and Jonathan Turner, who have been named co-presidents."
2,2016-01-27," WHEN I asked Alexa earlier this week who was playing in the Super Bowl, she responded, somewhat monotonously, ""Super Bowl 49's winner is New England Patriots."" ""Come on, that's last year's Super Bowl,"" I said. ""Even I can do better than that."" At the time, I was actually alone in my living room. I was talking to the virtual companion inside Amazon's wireless speaker, Echo, which was released last June. Known as Alexa, she has gained raves from Silicon Valley's tech-obsessed digerati and has become one of the newest members of the virtual assistants club. All the so-called Frightful Five tech behemoths — Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook and Google, now part of Alphabet — now offer virtual assistants, which handle tedious tasks in response to voice commands or keystrokes, on various devices. Apple's Siri is the best known, having been available since 2011, but Microsoft now has Cortana, Facebook is testing one called M, and Google builds its voice assistant into its search apps. These companies are presenting scorecards of their progress with quarterly earnings reports in the next few weeks, so what better time to hand out report cards to their artificially intelligent assistants? With that in mind, I set up tests for the assistants and graded their abilities to accomplish 16 tasks in categories that most consumers generally enjoy: music, productivity, travel and commuting, dining, entertainment and interests like sports. In the end, none of the voice assistants earned a report card that would make a strict parent proud. Here's how they stacked up in terms of grade-point averages out of 4.0. ■ Google (Google) — 3.1 ■ Siri (Apple) — 2.9 ■ Cortana (Microsoft) — 2.3 ■ Alexa (Amazon) — 1.7 Apple was the strongest at productivity tasks like calendar appointments and email; Google was the best at travel and commute-related tasks. Alexa excelled at music, and Cortana was mediocre across the board. Facebook was left out of the grading system because the company denied access to M, though I did hang out with her for two hours on a friend's account. More on that later. Apple said that Siri had ""become faster and smarter"" and spoke more languages than other assistants. Microsoft said it was ""just scratching the surface"" on how Cortana could help people. Google said that it wanted smartphones to do more of the heavy lifting, and that users could do a host of things just by speaking to Google. Amazon did not respond to requests for comment. On the productivity front, Siri, summoned by pressing the home button on the iPhone or by saying, ""Hey, Siri,"" was best able to schedule a meeting with a friend in Hawaii, check what was on my calendar for tomorrow, send an email and read my most recent email aloud. Others could complete only some of those tasks — Google could not read my last email out loud, and Alexa could not compose an email or create a calendar event. Siri also fared well in music-related tasks, but was bested by Alexa. Both assistants could play the song ""Hey"" by the Pixies, put on the latest episode of the ""Radiolab"" podcast and play music in the instrumentals genre. But Alexa, summoned simply by saying ""Alexa,"" could play a specific music station on Pandora, whereas Siri could only open the Pandora app. Google, which builds its voice-controlled assistant into the Google mobile app, achieved the highest marks for completing travel and commuting-related tasks. It responded perfectly to the question ""What is the traffic like to 221 Main Street?"" by showing me how long it would take to drive there. When I said, ""Take me to the Dogpatch Boulders gym,"" it showed me a map and gave voice directions. When I said, ""Find me plane tickets to New York next week,"" it offered an impressive response: Flights from San Francisco to New York next week start at $435, and the shortest flight is five hours and 10 minutes long. On travel and commuting, Cortana could offer solutions for the questions about traffic and directions, but not the one about flights. Siri earned a C-minus in the category: She could not give traffic estimates, and in response to the question about flights to New York, she spat out an unhelpful list of web search results related to traveling to New York. And instead of taking me to a bouldering gym to hone my physique, she took me to a brewery. Alexa got a D — she could offer traffic estimates for only one fixed location that was set up inside the app, like your office, and she added the task of finding a flight to New York to my to-do list. (I gave Alexa a pass on failing to map me to the gym. It seemed too much to ask from a home audio speaker.) For food-related tasks, Google and Apple were even. Each of the assistants was able to find a list of nearby Indian restaurants. Only Google's voice assistant could order delivery food, but with an unintuitive process that required naming a specific restaurant that delivers food through one of the apps that Google has teamed up with. Siri was the only one capable of booking a restaurant table. As for special interests, I asked each assistant two fairly obvious questions: Who won this past Sunday's football games, and who will be playing at the Super Bowl? Google, Cortana and Siri loaded scores for Sunday's National Football League games. But only Google and Cortana could say the Carolina Panthers would face the Denver Broncos in the Super Bowl, whereas Siri could only say that the big game would take place on Feb. 7 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. Alexa, on the other hand, was as clueless about sports as I am: She couldn't answer either question. That brings me to Facebook's elusive M assistant. The social network denied my request to meet her — it has granted access to only a small number of testers — so I used a privileged friend's Facebook Messenger account to meet M. According to the company, M is controlled partly by artificial intelligence and partly by humans; you talk to the assistant by sending messages to M through Facebook's Messenger service, just as you would send messages to a friend. In my limited time with M, I asked her to handle some of the most mundane tasks: Call the water company to ask about my utility bill, find out what meats are on sale at the local Whole Foods store and research when would be the cheapest time for my editor to fly to Hong Kong (not that I was trying to get rid of my editor). M pondered for a few minutes before answering each question, which made me suspect that a person handled most of the tasks. So I asked M to schedule a photo shoot with a studio owned by a friend of mine. Within minutes, the photo studio's phone rang, and my friend picked up. ""Hi, I'm calling on behalf of my boss,"" said M, who sounded like a young woman. ""He wanted to find out if you guys have the ability for a photo shoot at 2 p.m. tomorrow."" M left a contact phone number with a 650 area code, which includes Menlo Park, Calif., where Facebook has its headquarters. ""I didn't catch your name,"" my friend at the photo studio said. ""First name is M,"" the not-so-virtual assistant replied. ""Last name is Messenger."" ""Is that Greek?"" my friend at the photo studio asked. M laughed nervously. In other words, M probably is more capable than all the virtual assistants, but largely because humans are on the other end of the puppet strings handling tasks that artificial intelligence cannot. That makes me doubt that many consumers will get to meet M, at least in its current state, in which it is free. ""M is still in its very, very early stages,"" Facebook said in a statement. ""We're not yet focused on scaling M to a large number of people."""
0,2016-01-28," Amazon was expected to run away with the holiday season. Instead, it merely strolled. Revenue for the fourth quarter was a bit lighter than expected, the Seattle company reported on Thursday, and profit was a whole lot skimpier. Wall Street was crushed. The $24 billion or so that investors had added to the company's market value earlier in the day immediately vaporized, and then some. Amazon prompts strong emotions, and they were on full display Thursday — first a faith that the company will indeed measure up to outsize expectations to be the store that sells everything to everyone everywhere, then the sneaking fear that that might be a dream. Analysts said the fourth-quarter numbers, momentarily disappointing as they might have been, did not dent the optimistic case. ""This was more of an expectations correction than a fundamentals correction,"" said Mark Mahaney, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. ""There's nothing in the numbers that would mark a dramatic change in Amazon's growth or profit profile."" Instead, the mood swings just reflected an enthusiasm that got out of hand. ""The last three quarters the company generated bottom-line results that were materially above Street expectations,"" Mr. Mahaney said. ""That set up expectations we would see more of the same. We didn't."" Revenue for the fourth quarter jumped to $35.7 billion, up 22 percent from $29.3 billion. Impressive as that was, analysts had predicted a little bit more: $35.93 billion. Profit is something Amazon has trained Wall Street not to expect. But part of the optimistic assumptions is that the moment is drawing nigh when the dollars will start to pile up. Analysts estimated the retailer would earn $1.56 a share in the quarter, up from 45 cents in 2014. But the company said its fourth-quarter profit was only $1 a share. Investors, who had pushed Amazon shares up 100 percent last year, partly in anticipation of those profits, sent the stock up another $52 to $635 in regular trading Thursday. When the results came in, they did not shrug them off. After-hours, the stock fell more than $84. If Amazon disappointed, that needs to be seen in context. Traditional retailers, and even some e-commerce ones, are suffering. Walmart is closing 269 stores. Macy's is cutting  4,500 jobs and shutting dozens of stores. EBay just dashed expectations for the year. Against such travails, a 22 percent rise in revenue that was expected to be 23 percent is inconsequential. When Walmart reports its holiday sales quarter, revenue is forecast to actually be down for the quarter from 2014. Amazon's computing platform subsidiary, Amazon Web Services, contributed heavily to the bottom line. Operating income from that unit rose to $687 million in the quarter from $240 million in 2014. AWS will soon be a $10 billion business, company executives noted in a conference call with analysts. Getting all the work done has required many new employees. Amazon's head count grew 50 percent in the last year, to 230,000 full-time workers. Amazon might be the powerhouse of e-commerce, yet paradoxically has only a small share of the global market — which is one of the things feeding enthusiasm for it. For Amazon bulls, there are so many more worlds to conquer. In data assembled before the fourth-quarter results were in, the research firm eMarketer said Amazon had $71.8 billion in e-commerce sales over the last 12 months, an increase of 5.6 percent from the previous 12 months. Walmart, by contrast, had revenue of $13.5 billion online during the period. But Amazon's revenue pales against the worldwide e-commerce market, which eMarketer estimated as $1.672 trillion. ""Amazon is gaining share as evidenced by 26 percent unit growth, compared to our best estimate of 18 percent for global e-commerce growth,"" Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, wrote in a note to clients after the quarterly numbers. The note was headlined ""Investors Overreacting."" In the current quarter, Amazon has estimated that sales will grow 17 to 28 percent. Operating income might be as little as $100 million, which would be less than last year, or as much as $700 million, which would be considerably more.  It was a forecast that allowed plenty of room for enthusiasm, as it also left open the possibility of disappointment."
1,2016-01-28," Facebook acquired Parse, a toolkit and support system for mobile developers, in 2013. At the time, the social network's ambitions were high: Parse would be Facebook's way into one day harnessing developers to become a true cloud business, competing alongside the likes of Amazon, Google and Microsoft. Those ambitions, it seems, have fallen back to earth. On Thursday, Facebook said it plans to shut down Parse, the services platform for which it paid upwards of a reported $85 million. ""We know that many of you have come to rely on Parse, and we are striving to make this transition as straightforward as possible,"" Kevin Lacker, co-founder of Parse, said in a blog post. ""We enjoyed working with each of you, and we have deep admiration for the things you've built."" Most of what Parse does involves things most people will never see. Parse helps developers with support and tools, so that independent programmers can spend more time writing code and less time on keeping up the back end. Developers who use Parse include those at Quip, a productivity app, and Expedia's Orbitz, a travel website. Facebook would make money from Parse by storing data from developers and sending customers product notifications. Achieving that goal, however, would be no easy feat. Microsoft, Google and Amazon have similar developer offerings, along with a much richer set of other computing tools and services that developers need. Amazon Web Services, in particular, has in the past two years stressed both its developer tools and analytic services, so companies can think about what to build next. In every case, these companies can also benefit by selling other computing services, like complex commercial databases, which Facebook does not provide. At one point, Facebook was willing to take those risks. When Facebook bought Parse in 2013, Facebook's stock was below its initial public offering price of $38. The company had not grown a robust mobile advertising yet, and Facebook was eager to seek out other lines of business in hopes of future profits, according to two people with knowledge of the company's plans at the time who requestedÂ anonymity because they were not authorized to speak for the company. Parse seemed like a good opportunity for expansion. At the time, Internet businesses were in the midst of a major industry change, as users were shifting away from desktop computing and increasingly relying on mobile devices. Parse, the thinking went, could provide Facebook the opportunity to be the foundation of a whole new generation of developers building mobile apps in the age of the smartphone. Things have changed. Facebook is generating record profits and its mobile advertising business is booming; 80 percent of the company's advertising revenue now comes from mobile devices. As Facebook's fortunes have turned, it has shown less interest in pursuing other lines of business outside of what it does best. Instead, the company appears intent on building things that somehow, someday, will feed Facebook's core ad-based business — and those bets are going to have to get bigger and weirder Facebook also would have had to invest untold millions of dollars in capital and, more importantly, engineering talent, to get the Parse business fully off the ground to have a better chance at making a dent in competitors like Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Moreover, Facebook has already made two big, risky bets in Oculus, the virtual reality platform, and WhatsApp, the messaging service. Neither service currently generates material revenue for Facebook. Parse may have touched millions of people through the apps that developers built there, but that mattered little against Facebookâs size. With more than 1.5 billion registered users, a population of even 15 million customers is not 1 percent of Facebookâs audience. Building up Parse, it seems, eventually became more of a distraction than it was worth. ""Moving forward we want to dedicate more resources to high-impact products and services in areas like analytics, monetization, discovery, and authentication,"" Michael Kirkland, a Facebook spokesman, said in a statement. ""As a result, weâve made the difficult decision to wind down support for Parse."" Other Silicon Valley companies have encountered similar difficulties. Inside Cisco Systems, in its heyday, there was pressure to build businesses that yielded $1 billion or more in revenue, since anything less could not affect the overall company. Facebook, which unlike other clouds has not sought to rent computing and software to businesses, must essentially find this from social networking. Developers who used Parse will have a set of tools and a year-long window to be able to migrate their data off of the platform to other services. ""We're proud of what we've accomplished together with the Parse community, and we thank them for their support,"" Mr. Kirkland said."
0,2016-01-29," If there is one conclusion to draw from the company earnings reported on Thursday, it is this: Cloud computing is a booming business. This point was never much in doubt, but the numbers sure reinforced it. Amazon said that Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing platform, is growing rapidly and would soon be a $10 billion a year business. Microsoft, widely considered the runner-up in the cloud computing market, said its commercial cloud business was also going gangbusters and has a $9.4 billion annualized run rate. The two companies calculate their cloud revenue in different ways, so apples-to-apples comparisons are a fool's errand. Suffice it to say that the two have found a sweet and highly profitable spot. That makes some other news on Thursday all the more interesting. Facebook said it planned to shut down Parse, a toolkit for mobile developers that was supposed to provide an inside track to the cloud computing business. Parse was bought in 2013, when Facebook was looking for more revenue. (That is no longer much of a problem.)  In the end, Mike Isaac and Quentin Hardy write, the costs of competing against the top cloud businesses would take more resources than Facebook wanted to supply. "
0,2016-01-30," Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week's news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Farhad: How's it hanging, Mike? I wanted to start by addressing an awful rumor — I heard you were moving from New York to California, where I live. Please tell me this isn't true. Mike: I regret to inform you that this rumor is true. Also, our editors gave me the O.K. to move in with you. I think we have a chance at turning our new life together into an entertaining buddy comedy and/or reality show. Farhad: Oh no. My wife and kids are going to hate having to move. Anyway, before I start checking out Craigslist housing ads in Nevada, let's go over the tech news of the week, which was dominated by several huge earnings reports. I've got to say, I love earnings season. It's the one time we get a peek at some of the actual numbers that are often hidden in the murk of Silicon Valley puffery. And this week brought some big reversals. Mike: Nerd. (I do too.) Farhad: Apple reported its slowest-ever growth in iPhone sales, suggesting that the company has hit at least a temporary peak. I argued that the future for Apple is still bright, but many observers see a new, diminished era for a company that has grown like a steroidal gym rat over the last few years. Mike: As my economics professor always said, what goes up must come down, right? Or maybe that was my physics professor. I can't remember. I slept through most of high school. Farhad: Meanwhile, Microsoft's earnings showed that while its legacy personal computer businesses are in decline, it now has a thriving cloud business, and its line of Surface tablets and computers is selling well, too. So in a weird way, Microsoft's rebound offers an encouraging lesson for Apple fans — if you lose the crown, you can always claw your way back. Mike: I think Omar said that in the second season of ""The Wire."" I'm full of quote references today! Farhad: Then there was Amazon, which said it made a bunch of money over Christmas, but not quite enough to excite investors. I wonder if we're witnessing what could be a long-term shift in Wall Street's attitude toward Jeff Bezos's shopping engine. For two decades, investors have been willing to let Bezos reinvest every penny Amazon makes into building out a bigger and bigger company. But last year, Amazon started to show investors some skimpy profits — which are, like, the actual point of running a business — and to everyone's surprise, people on Wall Street seemed to like the money, and now they seem to keep wanting more. So it will be interesting to watch Amazon's fortunes over the next year. Will investors continue to punish it for favoring growth over profits? And if they do, will Jeff Bezos care? Then, finally, there was Facebook. I was told we couldn't use emoji in these newsletters, which is too bad, because the best way to illustrate Facebook's monster earnings would be several paragraphs of the Money Bag symbol. But you covered the earnings, so I'll let you take it away. Mike: I mean, it's the same story for Facebook that it has been for the past two and a half years: The company has absolutely nailed the secret to selling mobile advertising. Back in 2012, if you recall, the condition of Facebook's stock price was best described by using an animated GIF of a garbage fire. Shares were half what they were at the time of the company's initial public offering. The entire industry — including our own, mind you — was caught completely off guard by an enormous shift in consumer habits: People started viewing websites and using apps on their smartphones much more often than they used desktop computers. No one was ready for it, as we spent years just building out advertising for larger screens. Entire companies were destroyed. There were ripple effects in adjacent companies that were deeply connected to Facebook. (Go look at Zynga before and after its I.P.O.) It was a total mess. Facebook went heads down and figured out how to create ads that aren't terrible and conform to a screen the size of a smartphone. And lo and behold, the company did it in an amazingly fast amount of time. In 2012, Facebook's mobile advertising revenues represented roughly 20 percent of the company's overall ad revenue. As of last quarter, that number has quadrupled to 80 percent. It's astounding how fast it was able to do it. Farhad: All that's true, but I think you skipped an even earlier thing: Before making great mobile ads, Facebook first decided to make a great mobile app. I don't know if readers remember the earliest Facebook apps for smartphones but if not, they should click back to that animated GIF of a garbage fire. Until 2012, Facebook on an iPhone was slow and crashed more often than the Chinese stock market. By all accounts, Mark Zuckerberg himself was late to realizing the importance of touch-screen smartphones — I've heard that he regularly used a BlackBerry until around 2010. Mike: Good lord. Farhad: Early in 2012, as he prepared for the I.P.O., Zuckerberg finally realized that Facebook had to have a better mobile strategy. I think that's the key thing to credit him for; when he finally understood the importance of mobile software, he went all in. He forced Facebook's iPhone team to completely redo its app. When it did, Facebook's App Store reviews shot up from 1.5 stars to 4. The rest is history. Facebook is now one of the most-used apps on phones, and Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, Facebook's other properties, are all must-haves. Once you accomplish that, the piles of money follow. Mike: All very good points. But here's the rub: Now we see articles like the one USA Today ran on Thursday about Facebook being the new ""Teflon company,"" usurping Apple. Expectations for Facebook to keep up its enormous growth engine are just ratcheting up higher and higher. The company is probably going to run up against the same problem you just described with Amazon this last quarter. That's why I always try to keep people's expectations of me incredibly low. That way when I do something cool, everyone practically gives a party. Farhad: I guess I won't expect you to be doing any dishes after you move in. See you soon!"
0,2016-02-02," Ups and downs are nothing new in the fast-moving technology industry. And as soon as a company hits turbulence, calls for a management shake-up almost always follow. Yahoo has been through this cycle several times. Marissa Mayer, its current chief executive, became the company's seventh leader in less than five years when she took over in 2012. Her hiring initially brought new energy and helped Yahoo's stock regain some respect. But now she faces increasingly stiff headwinds herself, and is coping with low morale and a brain drain. On Tuesday she announced some plans to simplify and cut costs, including layoffs, and said the company would explore the possibility of selling some of its assets. Twitter, another struggling company, is also shaking up its leadership. It brought back a founder, Jack Dorsey, as chief executive last summer and he is now shaping a major overhaul of its executive ranks. History suggests that changing course can have big results. But not every company has needed to shake up its ranks to regain its footing. And even those that did bring in new management have found themselves under attack again: In the late 1990s, Priceline seemed to have the golden touch. On its first day of trading in 1999, its market value hit $12.9 billion. At the time, it was the highest first day valuation of any company that had gone public. It soon tried to branch out, applying its ""name your own price"" concept to a wide variety of products, from groceries to home mortgages. But this experiment ended as quickly as it had begun, as financing dried up. By the end of 2000, its founder, Jay Walker, left the company and the board to focus on another venture. The company's stock plummeted. At one point, the company was worth less than $250 million. But then, the company's fortunes slowly turned. The Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing increased his stake in the company in June 2001. A month earlier, the company had shuffled its executive ranks, and named Jeffery Boyd as president and later, chief executive. Mr. Boyd focused the company more on hotel bookings and expanded in Europe. Over the years, Priceline acquired competitors including Booking.com, Kayak and OpenTable, becoming dominant in the online travel segment. By 2010, it surpassed Expedia in online hotel reservations. It now has a market value of $53 billion. Keeping competition at bay is critical for any technology company, said David Hsu, a professor of management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. ""If you've discovered a valuable space, there's a lot of companies, new entrants,"" he said. Amazon was a pioneer in web retailing, beginning with online book sales in 1995. In 1999, Time magazine anointed the founder, Jeff Bezos, its Person of the Year. But the company had not recorded a profit in its early years, causing some analysts and investors to question whether it was any different than all the other dot-coms that failed by 2001. Mr. Bezos does not hold final control over Amazon as some other prominent tech founders do, like Mark Zuckerberg, who owns the majority of the controlling shares of Facebook. Yet stockholders stuck by Mr. Bezos and his strategy, and in the final quarter of 2001, the company reported a healthy profit. Its first full-year profit would have to wait until 2003, about six years after it went public. ""At Amazon, they were ruthlessly committed to the customer experience,"" said Nick Donatiello, a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. ""And that is still their strategy."" Profit remains somewhat elusive for the company, but much of its absence was intentional, with the company investing in growth. By 2006, for example, Amazon was branching out into serving businesses for storage, databases and other infrastructure with Amazon Web Services. Though it took years, Amazon's retail investments have begun to pay off, as Farhad Manjoo wrote recently. Through it all, Mr. Bezos consistently relayed his growth plan to investors. That's unlike some tech companies like Yahoo and Twitter, Professor Hsu of Wharton said. ""There's no clear communication either by way of their actions or their words as to how they are going stay relevant."" ""Of course, it is unlikely Bezos could have anticipated how the various initiatives would turn out,"" he added. ""He therefore had some sense of the necessary pacing of new business introductions to widen the touch points Amazon would need to ultimately win."" As chief of eBay, Meg Whitman was credited with bringing the fledgling company into the modern era. But when she stepped down after nearly 10 years at the helm, growth had stalled. The online auction site, like Amazon a darling of the dot-com boom, was suddenly stagnant. A year later, it named as its chief John Donahoe, the president of eBay's marketplaces division, whom Ms. Whitman had recruited from the consulting firm Bain & Company. Under Mr. Donahoe's tenure, eBay did not abandon its core business of online auctions. But it increasingly moved into mobile and its PayPal online payments subsidiary. It also began offering merchants valuable e-commerce tools. Among its big purchases was the 2011 acquisition of GSI Commerce, which helps manage the websites and online marketing campaigns for retailers including Toy ""R"" Us and Kenneth Cole. It also sold the voice and video service Skype, a company that was successful but did not exactly fit into the e-commerce model. (Criticism came later that Skype had been sold too cheaply.) ""It took a change in management to clean up some prior misdirection and set a new strategy,"" said Robert Peck, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. ""To make these changes, the company needed to 'reset expectations' and take the short-term hit from Wall Street as it invested for the long-term gain."" The success did not last. In 2014, Carl C. Icahn, the activist investor, attacked the eBay's management but eventually settled his boardroom battle. A few months later, Mr. Donahoe and the board said they had reached the same conclusion that Mr. Icahn had: EBay should be split in two, spinning off PayPal into a separate company. Mr. Donahoe left his job as chief executive, though was named chairman of PayPal after the split."
1,2016-02-02," European officials on Tuesday agreed to a deal with the United States that would let Google, Amazon and thousands of other businesses continue moving people's digital data, including social media posts and financial information, back and forth across the Atlantic. With billions of dollars of business potentially at stake, the data-transfer deal was the result of more than three months of often tense negotiations between United States and European Union policy makers, who have clashed over what level of privacy individuals can expect when companies and government agencies follow ever-expanding digital footprints. Part of the challenge is balancing individuals' privacy concerns with national security obligations, particularly in light of mounting fears about international terrorism. The agreement announced on Tuesday aims to address those privacy concerns and strike that balance by including written guarantees by the United States — to be reviewed annually — that American intelligence agencies would not have indiscriminate access to Europeans' digital data when it is sent across the Atlantic. Whether that provision will reassure privacy-rights groups remains to be seen. Many obstacles still await the deal, which must be officially approved by the European Union's 28 member states. National data protection regulators have yet to give their support to the pact, and European privacy-rights advocates are preparing to file legal challenges seeking to overturn it. The data-transfer agreement, replacing a 15-year-old pact that Europe's highest court struck down in October, is intended to let the free flow of digital data — the lifeblood of many global businesses — continue as usual. In seeking to ensure the continued free flow of data, the deal announced on Tuesday could especially benefit big American companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon that tend to dominate Internet searches, social media and digital commerce in Europe. But it is also meant to let nontech companies like the drug maker Pfizer and the industrial conglomerate General Electric continue to send customer and employee data between the United States and Europe. Europe's privacy watchdogs had demanded that European and American officials agree to a new deal by Jan. 31. Although negotiators missed that deadline, they had been meeting almost continuously in Brussels since Sunday to reach an agreement. They were driven by a sense of urgency, as industry executives and trade bodies on both sides of the Atlantic worried that the means for transferring data between two of the world's largest economies remained in jeopardy. Most sensitive, perhaps, were provisions demanded by the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, aimed at limiting how American intelligence agencies collect data on Europeans when companies send their personal information to the United States. The American negotiators, in response, agreed to provide the annual written assurances. These guarantees, European officials said, will be reviewed each year, with American and European policy makers meeting to ensure that the strict privacy rights of Europe's more than 500 million citizens are respected by United States agencies. ""We will hold the U.S. accountable on the commitments that they have made,"" Vera Jourova, the European Union's justice commissioner who has led the negotiating team, said on Tuesday. The new deal ""is a major achievement for privacy and for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic,"" Penny Pritzker, the United States Commerce secretary, said in a statement on Tuesday. ""It provides certainty that will help grow the digital economy."" Both sides will now spend the next two weeks completing the details of the new pact, which is to be called the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield. If formally approved, it would go into effect by early April. But the deal's first hurdle comes on Wednesday, when Europe's increasingly powerful national privacy agencies plan to pass their own judgment on how data can be safely transferred outside the European Union. Many of these agencies, which can investigate and issue fines to companies that they suspect of misusing people's digital information, remain skeptical that rules protecting Europeans' data will be upheld in the United States. And some of these monitors have said that they will support further restrictions on how companies can move the data if they suspect it may be misused. ""We are part of the game,"" Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, France's privacy chief, said in an interview last month in Paris. ""If you provide these services, then you have to protect people's privacy rights."" Ms. Falque-Pierrotin is the chairwoman of the Pan-European body that will announce its assessment on Wednesday. The agreement drew praise on Tuesday from DigitalEurope, a group representing trade associations and multinational tech companies doing business in Europe, including Apple, Google and Microsoft. John Higgins, the group's director general, called in a statement for national privacy agencies ""to view this signal from the European Commission as a sign of good faith and to hold off with any potential enforcement action until the new agreement has been fully implemented."" Privacy groups, though, expressed concern that the data-transfer deal does not comply with European law, which views an individual's right to privacy almost on par with freedom of expression. Several consumer groups have said that they will file complaints with European privacy agencies to challenge the new agreement, while others have called on the United States to improve its own privacy laws to match those currently available in Europe. ""The problem is that the U.S. remains unchanged,"" said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington. Despite these expected challenges, some European officials on Tuesday defended the new safe harbor agreement. In particular, the European Commission highlighted how the United States had proposed greater oversight on the access American intelligence agencies have to Europeans' data. The United States also agreed to establish an ombudsman in the State Department to act as a first point of contact for Europeans if they believed American government agencies had misused their data. Access granted to American intelligence agencies had become a sticking point in light of revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, about that agency's surveillance of foreign citizens. During the most recent talks in Brussels, which involved officials from the United States Commerce Department and the Federal Trade Commission, among others, American negotiators had argued that United States law provided greater oversight and supervision of American intelligence agencies' use of personal data than rules now in place across the European Union, according to several officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. National security arguments had become more vehement following the terrorist attacks in Paris last November, those officials said. United States ambassadors had defended the integrity of oversight of American intelligence agencies in discussions with senior politicians in countries like France, Germany and Britain in recent weeks, according to the officials who asked to remain anonymous.  But European Commission, which does not have the power to rule on its member states' national security practices, had demanded written guarantees. ""This isn't going to be a one-off decision by the commission,"" said Ms. Jourova, the European justice commissioner. ""We have achieved effective protection of Europeans' rights."""
0,2016-02-03," SEATTLE — Amazon signs may be headed to more physical storefronts. The Internet retailer plans to open more brick-and-mortar bookstores following the unveiling last year of one such location here in its hometown, according to a person briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential plans. But the company's plans for physical stores are modest, this person said, especially in comparison with reports of an expansion suggested by an unusual source, the chief of a large shopping mall operator. Sandeep Mathrani, chief executive of the mall operator General Growth Properties, was answering questions from analysts on Tuesday about foot traffic in malls when he said, of Amazon's bookstore plans, ""Their goal is to open, as I understand, 300 to 400 bookstores,"" according to a recording of the call. Mr. Mathrani did not say how he heard about Amazon's plans. Kevin Berry, a spokesman for General Growth Properties, declined to comment further. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported on Mr. Mathrani's comments about Amazon. A spokesman for Amazon declined to comment. Even if Amazon is not planning to go nationwide with its stores anytime soon, any expansion of its brick-and-mortar presence is likely to send shivers down the spines of other booksellers. Amazon's success as an online retailer of physical and electronic books has already devastated chains like Borders and seriously wounded Barnes & Noble. Independent booksellers, though, are seeing sales growth in many parts of the country, showing how reluctant some book fans have been to give up browsing store shelves. ""There are all kinds of studies that show the best way to find things when you don't know what you're looking for is an old-fashioned bookstore,"" said John Mutter, editor in chief and co-founder of Shelf Awareness, which publishes an email newsletter for booksellers and librarians. ""I think that's a major part of what Amazon is trying to do with this bookstore in Seattle."" Mr. Mutter said the success of some booksellers could not have escaped the notice of Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos. ""They seem very thorough in terms of competing,"" Mr. Mutter said. Last year, Amazon opened its first physical bookstore in the University Village shopping mall in Seattle. The store features thousands of books, a tiny sampling of those on Amazon's website, most of them with customer ratings of four stars and above. The books sell for the same price in the store as they do on Amazon's site. Because book prices regularly change on the site, visitors to the store scan books using a mobile app to find out how much they cost. Although the store is called Amazon Books, it prominently features a growing array of Amazon-made devices, including the Kindle tablet, the Fire TV set-top device and Echo, its home speaker and virtual assistant. Because Mr. Bezos has outsize ambitions for most of the company's initiatives, the opening of the Seattle location quickly led to speculation about a nationwide chain of Amazon stores. Jennifer Cast, an early Amazon executive and trusted lieutenant of Mr. Bezos, returned to the company to help oversee the store initiative after leaving Amazon more than a dozen years ago."
1,2016-02-03," SEATTLE — A day after saying that Amazon plans to open hundreds of physical bookstores, the chief executive of a large shopping mall operator has backed away from the comments.  In a statement Wednesday from General Growth Properties, the mall operator's chief executive, Sandeep Mathrani, said a comment he made this week on a conference call referring to the Internet retailer's ""goal"" to open 300 to 400 bookstores ""was not intended to represent Amazon's plans.""  His remarks prompted widespread coverage, however, suggesting that the Internet retailer was on the verge of an ambitious expansion into physical retail after opening one bookstore in a Seattle shopping mall last year.   While a reversal of sorts, Mr. Mathrani's statement on Wednesday was not technically a retraction; he did not say his earlier comment was inaccurate.  In fact, it is true that Amazon intends to open more bookstores, according to a person briefed on the matter who asked for anonymity because the plans are confidential. But Mr. Mathrani dramatically overstated the number, this person said.   It's unclear how Mr. Mathrani came up with the 300 to 400 figure for Amazon's store plans. Whether or not self-interest was a factor, the idea that the nation's most important Internet retailer wants to open a chain of stores could be beneficial to the perception of shopping malls at a time when many of them are struggling. Mr. Mathrani's Amazon remarks came during a bullish string of comments about Internet retailers investing in physical stores.   Mr. Mathrani's comments could not have pleased Amazon, which closely guards all of its future plans. The company's share price fell nearly 4 percent on Wednesday.  Kevin Berry, a spokesman for General Growth Properties, declined to comment on whether Amazon played any role in the company's decision to back away from the comments. Craig Berman, an Amazon spokesman, also declined to comment.  Barnes & Noble, a major Amazon rival in books, might also have been chagrined to hear Mr. Mathrani talking up the prospects for a big Amazon store expansion. A quick search of the website for General Growth Properties shows that Barnes & Noble is a tenant in several of its malls, including the Shops at La Cantera in San Antonio, Tex., Deerbrook Mall in Humble, Tex., and Glenbrook Square in Fort Wayne, Ind. Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for Barnes & Noble, declined to comment. "
0,2016-02-04," Amazon is poised to expand its one Seattle bookstore into a chain of such stores. Or is it? The rumor mill went into overdrive earlier this week when Sandeep Mathrani, chief executive of the mall properties company General Growth Properties, said on a conference call that Amazon was planning to open 300 to 400 physical bookstores. After his comments went viral — many people are eager to believe that Amazon is stretching its tentacles into all sorts of areas — Mr. Mathrani's company issued a one-sentence statement late Wednesday afternoon to amend what he had said, noting his remarks were ""not intended to represent Amazon's plans."" The backtracking immediately became the butt of jokes on social media, with numerous quips circulating on Twitter about the trustworthiness of mall company C.E.O.s. ""I can't believe a mall C.E.O. lied to us,"" went one tweet. ""What next, we find out they don't have the real Santa?"" So what's the truth of the matter?  While the scale of Amazon's store expansion plans may not be as broad as Mr. Mathrani described, the Internet retailer is planning at least some modest growth in its number of bookstores, wrote Nick Wingfield. And according to Recode, that may just be the beginning of potential plans for other types of stores, too.  Amazon has not commented on any store plans. And if its unveiling of the Seattle bookstore last year is any guide to future behavior — the company said nothing about the retail space until the store was essentially open for business — the odds of Amazon disclosing its plans are slim.

0,2016-02-13," The decades of trauma suffered by independent neighborhood bookstores — damage from bargain megastores, the ascension of the e-book and Amazon's flash delivery of cut-rate reading — hardly hindered Chris Doeblin's search for the right place to open his fourth independent bookstore in Manhattan. In fact those serial threats across 30 years in the business drove his search for his next ""indie"" locale. ""We are pushed from behind and driven ahead by the pull of the future,"" Mr. Doeblin said last month, explaining why his three Book Culture stores are not enough. ""I have 10-year-old kids. You have to reinvent yourself."" A reader might find his determined search a noble but counterintuitive escapade after years of watching the lights sadly go out on small neighborhood bookshops where social warmth was such a part of the browsing. But the good news is that the indies are quietly resurging across the nation, registering a growth of over 30 percent since 2009 and sales that were up around 10 percent last year, according to the American Booksellers Association, the indies' main organization with more than 2,200 stores. ""Existing stores are selling once more to a new generation of owners,"" said Oren Teicher, the A.B.A.'s chief executive officer, noting that such stores could never be resold during the gloomiest years, when they were under threat from Barnes & Noble and then later, Internet sales. The indies now find that readers are looking for life beyond their computer screens. They want to embrace books in all three dimensions and to select them in a tactile, less anonymous marketplace. Booksellers are fellow readers who converse knowledgeably and jot down their current favorites on helpful bookshelf notes. ""It's a more holistic consumerism,"" says Mr. Doeblin, describing the bookstore resurgence as part of the explosion of the localism movement that finds young new farmers delivering fresh produce to Main Street markets. ""The computer screen just hurts; you need a real book in your hand,"" he says. ""People become antisocial through technology and social media."" Mr. Doeblin relished opening his third Book Culture store in 2014 on the upper West Side only a few blocks from a Barnes & Noble that was reportedly struggling to survive in the face of Amazon. He had giant advance notices emblazoned on the windows announcing: ""You've Got Mail, New York! You're Going to Get Another Independent Book Store!"" He was delighted to find eager customers when it opened, and now has 15,000 people registered for discounts. The store holds various social activities and sells plenty of products like stationery, greeting cards, children's games and toys, even backpacks — all part of the merchandise of most successful bookstores nowadays. Mr. Doeblin has no idea what form the competitive threat will take next — Amazon drones delivering books to Broadway apartments? But he's been walking through assorted neighborhoods, convinced that a fourth Book Culture store can hold its own among the sorts of customers who savor true community as much as a good read."
0,2016-02-15," BOGOTÁ, Colombia — In 1979 the German director Werner Herzog set out into the Peruvian Amazon to begin filming ""Fitzcarraldo,"" the quixotic tale of an Irish rubber baron's quest to build an opera house in the jungle. What came next was one of the most painful ordeals in filmmaking. A crew member was bitten by a deadly snake and wound up amputating his own foot. Illnesses ensued. The Aguaruna Indians burned down Mr. Herzog's set in a dispute with him over their land. Nearly four decades later, the Colombian director Ciro Guerra, now 35, journeyed into the Amazon with a different approach. He arrived in the jungle with an anthropologist. The men explained the project to a shaman, who spent the night alone in the jungle, where, in Mr. Guerra's words, the healer carefully ""explained the project to the forest."" What some might have called superstition, Mr. Guerra simply sees as the cost of doing business in the Amazon. ""If the forest turns on you, you will get sick, there will be accidents, anything can take place — the indigenous people made that very clear to us,"" he said on a recent night as he discussed the making of his film, ""Embrace of the Serpent."" ""This was not a production that could have entered into combat with the forest."" The two-hour adventure film, shot in black and white, drew high praise at the Cannes Film Festival, along with an Academy Award nomination for best foreign-language film. (It opens in the United States on Wednesday.) It was Colombia's first Oscar nomination, and though the film faces long odds against perceived front-runners from Hungary (""Son of Saul"") and France (""Mustang""), Mr. Guerra is something of a national hero in a country eager for attention unrelated to its drug lords and guerrilla fighters. ""There's a huge flood of intellectual capital flourishing, now that the violence is abating in Colombia, and this film is a big part of that,"" said Wade Davis, an anthropologist and a protégé of Richard Evans Schultes, one of two ethnographers the film is loosely based on. Few filmmakers have dared to shoot in the Amazon, and those who have done so usually hewed to the theme of the white man who succumbs to madness in the jungle. Separate 20th-century journeys by two Westerners — Schultes and the social scientist Theodor Koch-Grünberg, who are here depicted in a hunt for a rare Amazonian plant — are the basis of Mr. Guerra's film. Their stories are told through the eyes of a skeptical native guide named Karamakate, who is searching for his tribe after a massacre and watches as his culture is decimated by Western invaders. Most of the film's actors, including Nilbio Torres, who plays Karamakate as a young man, are members of the Cubeo and Wanano, tribes that mostly live in small towns in southern Colombia, along the Brazilian border, and ""have a foot in both their world and ours,"" Mr. Guerra said. Only one had acted before; Spanish was often their second language, if not their third. Mr. Guerra spent three months training the cast in the art of performance, a process that he said was easier than he imagined because of the storytelling traditions of the tribe and their ability to listen. The script was written in Spanish, then translated — sometimes partly rewritten — by the actors into their own languages, nine in all. Sometimes cultures meet gently in this film, as when Karamakate listens to Haydn's ""The Creation"" oratorio, played quietly in the jungle on a portable phonograph. It's a nod to ""Fitzcarraldo,"" in which the rubber baron blasts opera arias into the jungle as his boat spins out of control. But mostly the cultures clash, a situation that becomes most real when Koch-Grünberg and Karamakate stumble across a group of children orphaned in an earlier massacre by rubber merchants. They are led by an aging monk, who beats Roman Catholicism into them with a whip and forbids their ""demonic languages,"" forcing them to speak Spanish. Forty years later, when an older Karamakate returns, the scene is apocalyptic. A crucified body hangs from a tree. Catholicism and Spanish are gone, replaced by evangelical Christianity and Portuguese. The leader of these natives is another white man, who claims to be the messiah and talks of ordering his flock to commit mass suicide. Mr. Guerra said that character and those scenes are based on the history of a 19th-century zealot named Anizetto, whose thousands of followers were put down by the Brazilian military. ""It's a phenomenon that has repeated itself many times there,"" the director said. ""The Amazon is a spiritual place. People there are deeply spiritual. And when someone strips away the indigenous spirituality that's already there, it creates a vacuum that gets filled with fundamentalism and insanity."" Mr. Guerra said he thought the film would be his first and last set in the Amazon. Mr. Herzog, who returned to the jungle for a 1999 documentary, ""My Best Fiend"" (a reference to the actor Klaus Kinski), that recounted his ordeal making ""Fitzcarraldo"" and other films, now plays down the difficulties. In an email, he wrote: ""No one should make a big deal about filming in the Amazon, it's just another forest."" Mr. Guerra has a different take. He spoke of the Cerros de Mavicure, three stone mounds that make up part of an old geological formation called the Guayana Shield in southeastern Colombia. In the film's final scene, Schultes and Karamakate climb the mounds and find the flowering plant they've been searching for. The Amazon forest stretches far into the distance. ""I see it as a place that is charged with power,"" Mr. Guerra said."
0,2016-02-16," ""The horror! The horror!"" The terminal valediction of Kurtz in Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" is deconstructed with a raging eloquence in the Colombian director Ciro Guerra's majestic, spellbinding film, ""Embrace of the Serpent."" Is the unspeakable savagery evoked by his dying words really beyond the reach of the civilized imagination? I doubt it. That tricky word ""civilized"" connotes enlightenment, behavioral restraint, evolutionary advancement and the suppression of bestial impulses. But what is so civilized about mass slaughter, torture and planetary despoliation in the name of anything or anybody? It shouldn't have taken a journey up the Congo River for a white man to discover the evil within. That is the uncomfortable truth at the core of Mr. Guerra's tragic cinematic elegy for vanished indigenous civilizations in the Amazon jungle. Viewed largely through the aggrieved eyes of a shaman whose tribe is on the verge of extinction at the hands of Colombian rubber barons in the 19th and 20th centuries, ""Embrace of the Serpent,"" a fantastical mixture of myth and historical reality, shatters lingering illusions of first-world culture as more advanced than any other, except technologically. The director's third film, it is the more remarkable for being shot in black and white, with one brief color sequence near the end. Beautiful isn't a strong enough word to describe its scenes of the heaving waters of the Amazon and its tributaries, on which two explorers, separated by more than 30 years, navigate in canoes, accompanied by a shaman, Karamakate. The film's central figure, he is the last survivor of the Cohiuano, an Amazonian tribe killed off by the rubber barons. He is no innocent, noble savage but an angry, morally complex individual with a heart full of grief. He may be in greater harmony with the natural world than any foreign intruder, but he is alone. The film gives full voice to his view of a social order in which the rules of nature assimilated and handed down through the centuries among the Cohiuano must be obeyed, or else. The Amazonian ecosystem, in which everything seemingly preys on everything else, is a continual and endless feeding frenzy. In a signature image, an aquatic serpent devouring another snake is observed by a glowering jaguar. Inspired by the travel journals of Theodor Koch-Grünberg, a.k.a. Theo (Jan Bijvoet), a German ethnologist and explorer, and Richard Evans Schultes, a.k.a. Evan (Brionne Davis), an American biologist considered the father of modern ethnobotany, the film imagines their parallel journeys, decades apart, seeking the yakruna, a sacred healing plant. This miraculous cure-all is a hallucinogen that attaches itself to rubber trees. In Karamakate's eyes, the European and American marauders who enslaved and destroyed his tribe are agents of an insane culture devoted to genocidal conquest and rapacious destruction. He finds the concept of money laughable; it is just useless paper. He urges the explorers to throw their luggage overboard. Their possessions are ""just things,"" he scoffs. To the extent that the film persuades you that he is right, ""Embrace of the Serpent"" is potentially life-changing. One thing Evan refuses to relinquish is a portable phonograph on which he plays a recording of Haydn's ""Creation."" Karamakate responds respectfully to the sublime music. The first journey takes place in 1909, when Theo is near death. (Koch-Grünberg actually died in 1924). Accompanied by the young Karamakate (Nilbio Torres), he is escorted by canoe up the Amazon River with a guide, Manduca (Yauenkü Miguee), who had worked on a rubber plantation and was freed by Theo. In a movie in which nine languages are spoken, Manduca is the cultural mediator and sometime interpreter. Initially reluctant to help Theo find a yakruna, Karamakate agrees to only if Theo will help him locate other surviving members of the Cohiuano, who he says exist. Later, Evan makes the same journey with the older, enfeebled Karamakate (Antonio Bolívar Salvador), whose tribe is now extinct. Karamakate has lost his ability to communicate with rocks and trees and is weighed down by a resigned sadness. The movie jumps between the two journeys, which follow roughly identical routes. The film's anger is concentrated in two devastating scenes of tyrannical white intruders. At a Roman Catholic mission, a Spanish priest presides over a flock of boys orphaned by the conflicts between rubber barons and indigenous tribes. Dressed in white robes and forbidden to speak ""pagan languages,"" the boys are viciously whipped at the whim of this Dickensian monster. Decades hence, at another riverside community, the dying indigenous wife of a self-proclaimed white messiah is healed by one of Karamakate's potions, and her husband proclaims himself the Son of God. In a delirium, he invites his followers to consume his body and blood. As they encircle him like vultures, the visitors flee. From here, the film moves to mystical higher ground, as abhorrence expands into awe. Instead of ""The horror!,"" I would substitute ""The wonder!"" ""Embrace of the Serpent"" is not rated. In Spanish and Amazonian tribal languages, with English subtitles. Running time: 2 hours 5 minutes."

0,2016-02-24," SAN FRANCISCO — Microsoft announced on Wednesday that it was buying Xamarin, a company that helps software developers write applications for mobile devices. The price was not disclosed, but is believed to be more than $300 million. It is a deal that says much about the competition between Google, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft to control much of the computing world over the next few years. A.W.S., Google and Microsoft's Azure business all rent access to globe-spanning cloud computing systems, each with millions of servers. All are trying to fill them with capabilities that developers can use to build products faster. The point is to get the corporate business into their clouds, and sell additional features once they are there. Scott Guthrie, the vice president for cloud and enterprise at Microsoft, said Xamarin would continue to offer development tools to write for Apple's iOS and Google's Android mobile operating systems. Xamarin says it has 15,000 customers in 120 countries. Developers ""can choose any cloud"" in which to manage and deploy their mobile applications, he said, but added ""you'll see a deep integration with Azure,"" including features that won't be available in competing clouds. In other words, the idea is to treat everything equally, some more than others. It makes sense. In this competition, A.W.S. has an early lead and an outsize share of start-up developers. Google is vaunted for its low price and capabilities. Microsoft has the most corporate software in existing servers, and is trying to transfer those customers to the Azure cloud. To the extent Xamarin can help turn those into mobile apps, it helps with continuity. ""We see enterprises that want to develop solutions to employees on mobile,"" Mr. Guthrie said. In addition, he said, ""every enterprise wants to deliver mobile software to its own customers."" That idea underlines another trend in the current competition: With access to the cloud, mobile, sensors and large-scale data analysis, every company is becoming responsible for the entire life of its product, not just to the point of purchase, and customers are starting to demand that companies remain aware of how their products are being used. ""The customers we are working with have a desire to build applications factories,"" said Nat Friedman, the chief executive of Xamarin, who will oversee all tools development under Mr. Guthrie. ""They all want end-to-end service, and this is a way to offer that."" A couple of other items in the Xamarin deal speak to broader events. For one, it underlines that Facebook has walked away from serving others; in late January, it shuttered its efforts in Parse, another mobile app developer. Everything Facebook does, for now, is in reference to the Facebook system, not apps used elsewhere. The Xamarin deal follows several months of lower valuations for start-ups, and hits to the stock price of cloud software companies. Microsoft may be making the first of several acquisitions among the cloud companies as they strive to become even bigger."

0,2016-02-28," COBIJA, Bolivia — When Evo Morales, Bolivia's first indigenous president, took office a decade ago, he vowed to put this impoverished town in the Amazon Basin on the kind of pedestal often reserved for a capital city. He filled its coffers with profits from the country's natural gas industry. He even seized large estates and handed them to new arrivals like Tania Chao, 19, whose family received a house when it came to Cobija with nowhere to live. Yet when Mr. Morales asked Ms. Chao to vote for him last week, in a referendum to let him run for a fourth term, she did not feel that she could return the favor. The president had improved the town, she said, but he had been in office for longer than most people had lived in Cobija. ""It's time to find someone else to continue what he did,"" she said after the referendum, which Bolivians rejected. Latin American leftists like Mr. Morales have suddenly felt their longevity ebb as a tide rises against them. But is the wave of discontent a rejection of the left? Or is it something more personal, aimed at the outsize leaders themselves, not necessarily at the ideas they have promoted? In Venezuela, former President Hugo Chávez's movement lost by a landslide in recent elections. In Argentina, the left-wing allies of former President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner could not hold onto her office. Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, a populist educated in the United States, abandoned an effort to seek another term. Corruption accusations and economic woes have left President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil battling impeachment proceedings. But while longstanding leftist leaders and their movements may be faltering, their policies have taken a lasting hold in Latin America. Much as President Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher took the United States and Britain down a more conservative path, leaders like Mr. Morales made a commitment to diminishing inequality that is expected to remain even as governments come and go. ""No leader in Latin America today can afford not to focus on inequality and go back to the neoliberal formulas of the 1990s,"" said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy institute in Washington. ""Whatever criticism you might have of the leaders of the left, they put their finger on the legitimate grievance of Latin Americans: that they had been excluded from the political system."" For some of the opponents now taking power, the question is not about razing the leftist models, but about making repairs and adjustments to them.  No case is more extreme than Venezuela, where years of government controls over the economy and reliance on a booming oil industry diminished agricultural production to the point that the country was importing its meat, milk and rice. Then came the perfect storm when oil prices sank last year, creating triple-digit inflation and food shortages. In parliamentary elections, leftists were wiped out after 16 years of control.  The opposition rose by criticizing government subsidies, but its plan focuses on cutting them for the wealthy and stabilizing them for the poor. President Nicolás Maduro, Mr. Chávez's successor, agreed to raise the price of gasoline, reducing a subsidy seen as benefiting the car-owning wealthy. No one has suggested making changes that could harm the poor. Argentina's new president, Mauricio Macri, has enacted sweeping changes that have shifted the country to the center-right, including shrinking the state payroll and reducing electricity subsidies. But Mr. Macri has maintained price control strategies intended to shield people from inflation. He also extended a child benefit program that was the cornerstone of Mrs. Kirchner's social policy. ""Macri, as well as the rest of Latin America, now understands that it's necessary to maintain and improve the social agenda,"" said Alejandro Grisanti, a former Latin America economist at Barclays Capital. Here in Bolivia, many point out that while Mr. Morales was blocked from running in the next election, no successor could undo his work in Cobija. This small Amazonian rubber port became a laboratory for Mr. Morales's project to bring the government to the country's poor periphery. The portion of Cobija's annual municipal budget from national gas taxes increased to $40 million today from $1.2 million in 2006, the year Mr. Morales took office, and helped underwrite a public university and a large solar plant in a place where there had been cows, jungle and dirt roads. ""I don't know why other governments never sent any resources here before,"" says Luis Adolfo Flores, the governor of Pando, the state that includes Cobija, and a member of Mr. Morales's Movement Toward Socialism party. Twenty years ago, Alipio Rodríguez Suárez, 74, lived in an isolated patch of jungle next to a river. Now he has hundreds of new neighbors and an asphalt road with a median in front of his house. He also receives pension under a program established by Mr. Morales. He says the modest $36 a month covers his bills. ""I can be retired now,"" he said. ""My parents worked in the rubber industry until they died."" The population here has doubled to 47,000 in 10 years, an increase that includes many indigenous Aymara and Quechua people who relocated. Storefronts have opened with facades that reflect indigenous traditions. Government workers are now learning Cabibeño, an Amazonian language. The elevation of indigenous culture — one of Mr. Morales's trademarks — has had a lasting effect, residents say. ""The mentality of the people has changed,"" said Juan Carlos Arequipa, a taxi driver in Cobija. ""None of us thought we would have a satellite,"" he said, referring to Bolivia's Túpac Katari 1 satellite, built and launched by the Chinese in 2013 and named after an indigenous leader. ""We have the ability to do great things."" Yet Mr. Shifter, of the policy institute, said that development had backfired on Mr. Morales, raising expectations in an electorate that became more critical of him, especially as his presidency dragged on. ""He became a victim of his own success,"" Mr. Shifter said. ""People now have pride and demands."" Corruption allegations surround the president. On Friday, the authorities arrested Gabriela Zapata Montaño, with whom Mr. Morales had a child out of wedlock. Ms. Zapata, who was the director of a Chinese company that received millions in government contracts, was under investigation in connection with peddling favors, the authorities said. Similar complaints surfaced in Cobija, where the Evo Morales School sits empty, a $650,000 project that was never completed because a developer vanished after receiving government money. Only half of the first story was built, and vines are growing on the exposed rebar. On Thursday, protesters here blocked a road, demanding that the city provide water, gas and electricity to a neighborhood they had created after seizing land. Mr. Morales once supported such takeovers but had not supported these people, and they wanted to know why. ""We are in the middle of a city, and we have no lights,"" said María Estera, a 61-year-old teacher. Finally an organizer said the government had relented and would begin installing electricity. ""We will have lights by 6 p.m. tomorrow,"" he said to cheers. The protest broke up. ""We have learned from Evo how to do this, and we can use it against them,"" one of the demonstrators said. ""When he was a peasant, this was the strategy that he used."""
0,2016-03-03," SAN FRANCISCO — Amazon's Alexa is gaining new powers, and a couple of new looks, too. Amazon, the Internet retailer, on Thursday announced two new siblings for the Echo, the voice-controlled household assistant that people address as ""Alexa"" and that became a surprise hit for the company last year. One new product, Amazon Tap, is a slimmer, shorter, portable version of the Echo. Rather than requiring an electrical wall connection, the Tap runs off a rechargeable battery. It connects with phones and the Internet through Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. The Tap acts as an ordinary wireless speaker for a phone, but it also provides Alexa on the go. People can ask about weather and traffic, ask for the news, tell it to play a song from a streaming service, or do any one of dozens of other tasks. The device, which will begin shipping at the end of the month, will sell for about $130. Amazon also announced the Echo Dot, essentially an Echo without that device's powerful speaker. The Dot, which will sell for about $90, looks like a hockey puck, and is meant to provide Alexa's voice functions for existing speaker systems. The Dot connects to those speakers either through a wire or over Bluetooth; after that, it functions as another Echo. Dot shipments also will begin at the end of March. Sales will initially be limited to people who already own an Echo or one of Amazon's Fire TV devices — a Dot buyer will have to ask Alexa to order one. The new devices suggest that Amazon has an expansive vision for the Echo, which looked like an experiment for the company when it was introduced in late 2014. The company has not provided sales data for the device, but it has said that sales exceeded its expectations and that customer reviews are rhapsodic. Amazon appears to have increased investment in the device — it keeps adding new features and capabilities to Alexa, and this year it ran Super Bowl ads about the gadget. ""The response has been nothing short of incredible,"" said David Limp, Amazon's senior vice president for devices, at an event on Wednesday about the new hardware. ""This is almost unprecedented in the history of Amazon, to see this much demand and love for a product."""

2,2016-03-03," Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and a parade of other technology companies filed a barrage of court briefs on Thursday, aiming to puncture the United States government's legal arguments against Apple in a case that will test the limits of the authorities' access to personal data. The extraordinary show of support for Apple from the tech companies, including many rivals, underscores how high the stakes are for the industry with the case, in which the authorities are demanding Apple's help to break into an iPhone used by a gunman in a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif., last year. In all, around 40 companies and organizations, along with several dozen individuals, submitted more than a dozen briefs this week to the Federal District Court for the District of Central California, challenging every legal facet of the government's case, like its free speech implications, the importance of encryption and concerns about government overreach. ""These companies, which are often fierce competitors, have joined together to voice concern about the attempted government overreach in this case, which threatens the integrity and security of their products and privacy rights of consumers in general,"" said Neal Katyal, a lawyer at Hogan Lovells for the tech companies and a former acting solicitor general of the United States. Edward J. McAndrew, a lawyer at Ballard Spahr who is not involved in the Apple matter, said it was highly unusual to see a flood of briefs by so many parties this early in a case. He called the outpouring ""Supreme Court-level advocacy"" and said the campaign was intended to have influence beyond the court with legislators and others. ""This is a show of force,"" said Mr. McAndrew, a former federal prosecutor who focused on online crimes. ""This is a battle for public opinion."" Bruce Sewell, Apple's general counsel, said on Wednesday that the company was ""humbled by the outpouring of support."" The case between Apple and the government became public last month, when a federal magistrate judge in California ordered the company to bypass the security functions on the iPhone. Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, opposed the order, arguing the case could have far-reaching implications for other devices and software, with governments everywhere able to demand more access to tech companies' data. Several tech companies were initially careful and subdued in their support of Apple, with some privately debating whether the San Bernardino attack was the right case for challenging the government. Last week, some tech companies including Microsoft began to back Apple more forcefully, saying they planned to file briefs supporting it in court. In the brief on Thursday from Amazon, Microsoft and others, the tech companies said they shared the public's outrage over the ""heinous act of terrorism"" in San Bernardino, but said they were united in the view that the government's case exceeded the boundaries of existing law and would hurt Americans' security. A collection of 17 Internet companies, including Twitter, Airbnb and LinkedIn, filed a separate brief objecting to the government's use of the All Writs Act, a statute from 1789 that underlies many law enforcement requests for tech companies' data, in the San Bernardino case. AT&T and Intel also submitted independent briefs backing Apple. In the filing from the group that includes Twitter and LinkedIn, the companies said the government ""seeks unbounded authority to compel Apple to design software that does not currently exist and that will circumvent and undermine security measures intended to protect its users' data."" ""We're facing a very big question as a country, industry and a world about what privacy will look like in the digital era,"" said Aaron Levie, the chief executive of the data storage company Box, which signed on to the brief with Amazon, Google and others. ""There is a global impact for these tech companies if we don't land on the right side of having a strong framework for how companies deal with security and these kinds of requests in the digital age."" Apart from the tech companies, seven prominent security experts and 32 law professors signed on to joint briefs on Thursday. Several industry trade organizations and digital rights groups submitted their own filings this week. Some echoed Apple's slippery slope argument that opening up one iPhone would lead to a domino effect from governments worldwide. The Media Institute, a nonprofit research foundation that focuses on communications policy, warned in its filing that the court's order could be ""be applied against media companies as government authorities seek to acquire access to confidential information stored on mobile devices used by journalists."" The support for Apple was a torrent compared with the stream of filings backing the Justice Department in the case. Among the staunchest supporters on the side of government were six people whose family members were killed in the California attack. ""Broader questions about the fate of smartphone encryption and data privacy can be saved for another day and another forum,"" the families wrote in a brief. ""This case certainly presents the conditions — a mass murder by terrorists implicating national security interest — where requiring Apple's technical assistance is at its apex."" Stephen G. Larson, the lawyer representing the victims' families, said he was frustrated that Apple was drawing a line in the sand ""over a phone that didn't even belong to the terrorist and that they have permission to unlock."" The iPhone of the San Bernardino attacker, Syed Rizwan Farook, was issued by his employer. ""So many of Apple's arguments are red herrings because this is not about privacy more than any other search in a criminal investigation is about privacy,"" Mr. Larson said. ""That is scaremongering and that is false."" A handful of law enforcement groups also filed briefs supporting the government's position, including a joint one from the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys and the National Sheriffs' Association. Those groups listed several instances when iPhone data was an essential piece of a criminal case, including child pornography and sex trafficking cases. They argued that criminals were moving to iPhones because of Apple's refusal to help the government and that the company was making data extraction from its products impossible. ""If Apple can refuse lawful court orders to reasonably assist law enforcement, public safety will suffer,"" the trade groups wrote. Not all family members of San Bernardino victims sided with the government. This week, Salihin Kondoker, whose wife, Anies, was shot three times but survived the attack, wrote a letter to the court saying he thought there was little valuable information on the iPhone used by the gunman. Mr. Kondoker said Apple's fight was about something bigger than one phone. ""They are worried that this software the government wants them to use will be used against millions of other innocent people,"" he wrote. ""I share their fear."""

0,2016-03-07," Even as much of the tech industry is shifting into a less frothy period, one thing hasn't changed: the fierce competition for top technical talent. So found Quentin Hardy, who took a close look at the recruiting landscape for cloud computing. The battles for top engineers in the cloud industry are at a fever pitch: Tech titans including Amazon and Oracle are duking it out for talent, often accompanied by snide remarks and one-upmanship. Many cloud engineering jobs now pay between $300,000 and $1 million, in some cases double the amount from five years ago. Many of the hiring battles are taking place in Seattle, where Amazon has its Amazon Web Services business that is widely considered the 800-pound gorilla of the cloud computing industry. Oracle also has an office in Seattle, as do Google and Facebook. Nearby in Redmond, Wash., Microsoft is building up its Azure cloud computing unit. Talent poaching is nothing new in the tech industry, but the continued compensation increases and the grabs for top recruits in the cloud business underscore just how important that technology — which underpins so much of the digital data that we all create, consume and store — has become."
1,2016-03-07," SAN FRANCISCO — Amazon Web Services, a globe-spanning cloud computing network that is part of the online retailing giant Amazon, has rapidly become one of the most powerful forces in technology. It has also become a target for poachers. Last October, at a conference in Las Vegas with thousands of corporate executives and software developers in attendance, A.W.S.'s chief, Andy Jassy, strode before an intentionally poorly disguised image of Lawrence J. Ellison, founder and chairman of the Oracle Corporation. Foot-tall words like ""bullies,"" ""extorted"" and ""strong arm"" appeared next to Mr. Jassy and the image of Ellision. The logo of Oracle, one of the biggest companies in Silicon Valley, was barely crossed out. ""Our marketing team needs work on redaction,"" Mr. Jassy joked. Better cloaked was the reason for his enmity: Oracle had been slow to get into the cloud business, but recently made multiple hiring raids on A.W.S. Both Oracle and Amazon declined to comment on Mr. Jassy's dig. The hunt for the hard-to-find talent that can build and run the massive data centers behind cloud computing is pitting three generations of companies against one another. Old-guard companies like Oracle, tech's current giants like Amazon and its peers, as well as Bay Area start-ups are offering big salaries and big perks for cloud computing experts. On the social media site LinkedIn, for example, there are over 130 engineering positions available at Oracle Seattle. Many of them are the kind of jobs that now pay $300,000 to $1 million a year, according to Shannon Anderson, who has been recruiting engineers in Seattle and the Bay Area for 25 years. Seattle and its surrounding towns are a hot spot for this kind of tech talent because they are home to A.W.S., which runs the biggest cloud computing service, and Microsoft, which has a large cloud business called Azure. Google also has a cloud computing office in the area. So does Facebook. ""Someone working deep inside Amazon is getting five to 20 recruiting offers a day,"" Ms. Anderson said. ""Compensation has doubled in five years."" For a recruiter, who is typically paid a percentage of a star engineer's compensation, ""this is a very good time,"" she said. Cloud computing, which powers an increasing number of our devices and services, allows a vast collection of computers — often spread around the world — to operate like one giant machine. These computing clouds are being filled with once unimaginable amounts of data from apps, websites and sensors on all sorts of things. Fast-growing online services like Snapchat run on cloud systems. Apple has its own cloud, as does Facebook. Cloud systems even offer the computing muscle needed for things like artificial intelligence. As other tech sectors show signs of slowing, cloud services have created unprecedented demand for highly educated engineers and mathematicians who can build and operate these flywheels of data. Instead of asking about the latest computer coding languages or how to make a web page load faster, the most important question in tech hiring has become: Can you handle petabytes? That is the data in about 13 billion images, or roughly the amount of printed information that would fit in 20 million file cabinets. In the Bay Area, $125,000 a year is not an uncommon salary for someone newly out of graduate school with the expertise to do cloud computing work. With five years of experience, $300,000 along with a range of stock or job opportunities that greatly inflate the value of those paychecks have become the norm. ""It's an aggressive market,"" said Corey Sanders, director of program management at Microsoft Azure. ""We are all data engineers now, and we can convince people that this is the best place to learn that."" The ability to deal with so much data has also become important to industrial companies like General Electric in figuring out things like jet engine maintenance schedules. G.E.'s pitch to cloud computing experts: We offer a chance to rebuild the industrial world. In the last three years, G.E. has hired 1,500 software developers and systems engineers, and trained a similar number of existing employees to work on cloud systems connected to everything from smartphones to wind turbines and jet engines. ""We've hired from every large company, places like Amazon and Google, as well as start-ups, or out of schools,"" said William Ruh, the head of G.E.'s cloud business. ""We pay well, with attractive benefits, a life and a chance to work on the mission to remake American industry."" Still, he said, ""I'm totally shocked at how fast compensation is moving up."" For smaller companies, the gold rush is more complicated. In San Francisco's South Park neighborhood, Tom Chavez runs a company called Krux that scans data from more than three billion devices, creating a trove of seven petabytes of information retrieved by several hundred companies. Many of his 160 or so employees are just the kind of people the giants, along with other start-ups, are looking for. ""LinkedIn or Facebook can offer an engineer with a few years' experience a package close to $1 million,"" said Mr. Chavez, who co-founded Krux and is its chief executive. ""We wanted someone out of Stanford for an internship, and Google offered her an annualized $180,000 for the summer,"" or about $45,000 for three months. Facebook also wants employees like the people Mr. Chavez has hired. In fact, Vivek Vaidya, a Krux co-founder, calls the steep salaries Krux is compelled to pay ""our Facebook tax."" Krux takes up several floors of a brick building at the base of South Park, a onetime place of sweatshops that has filled with start-ups and venture capitalists. On the ground floor, development engineers get daily calls asking if they want to jump ship. A nearby team of data scientists gets 20 or more unsolicited emails a week via LinkedIn. Upstairs, Krux's recruiter strives to keep people, even as he looks to take from others. ""I can't compete with a $50,000 signing bonus from Google, so I focus on the person, what really motivates them,"" said Cade Garrett, who has recruited about 100 people to Krux. Besides offering stock options that could be valuable if the company has initial public offering, a fast-growing start-up can offer younger engineers a crash course in technology — the kind of training that could one day allow them to start their own companies. ""I tell them this isn't the best-paying job, but they have to think about where things are going: Everything they do here is mission critical,"" Mr. Garrett said. ""You go to Google, you can't be sure that in a couple of years you'll have a product to show."" Mr. Chavez thinks industry titans like Larry Page, the chief executive of the Alphabet holding company that includes Google, are intentionally driving up salaries. ""If I was Larry, I'd do the same thing: throw a few more million at people and cut off everyone else's oxygen."" Even so, Mr. Garrett tries to keep engineers' contact information off the Krux websites to foil recruiters. And he is more than happy to do his own poaching. Zenefits, a fast-growing online employee-benefits company currently reeling from the departure of its founding chief and a round of layoffs, is a target. ""Absolutely, I'll call into any company that is in trouble,"" he said."
0,2016-03-09," Many of the world's largest technology companies have spent the last five years searching in vain for the holy grail, a machine to succeed the smartphone as the next must-have gadget. They have made digital watches and fitness trackers, all manner of computerized glasses and goggles, and more doodads to plug into your TV than there are shows to watch on it. Yet at the moment, the most promising candidate for the Next Great Gadget isn't made by Apple, Google, Facebook or Microsoft. Instead, it is the Echo, a screenless, voice-controlled household computer built by Amazon — a company whose last big foray into consumer electronics, the Fire Phone, was a humiliating flop. This time it may be different. A bit more than a year after its release, the Echo has morphed from a gimmicky experiment into a device that brims with profound possibility. The longer I use it, the more regularly it inspires the same sense of promise I felt when I used the first iPhone — a sense this machine is opening up a vast new realm in personal computing, and gently expanding the role that computers will play in our future. What is most interesting about the Echo is that it came out of nowhere. It isn't much to look at, and even describing its utility is difficult. Here is a small, stationary machine that you set somewhere in your house, which you address as Alexa, which performs a variety of tasks — playing music, reading the news and weather, keeping a shopping list — that you can already do on your phone. But the Echo has a way of sneaking into your routines. When Alexa reorders popcorn for you, or calls an Uber car for you, when your children start asking Alexa to add Popsicles to the grocery list, you start to want pretty much everything else in life to be Alexa-enabled, too. In this way, Amazon has found a surreptitious way to bypass Apple and Google — the reigning monarchs in the smartphone world — with a gadget that has the potential to become a dominant force in the most intimate of environments: our homes. If all this sounds over-the-top, read some of the reviews. On Amazon's site, the Echo has racked up more stars than an Oscars party. Amazon doesn't release sales numbers, but the company is investing big in Echo. It ran Super Bowl ads to push the device and last week it unveiled two new versions of the machine. One is a portable version of the Echo and the other is meant to plug into existing speaker systems. Scot Wingo, the chairman of ChannelAdvisor, an e-commerce consulting firm, said the early signs suggested that the Echo was on a path to become Amazon's next $1 billion business. ""It's one of the most sold-out things that I see on Amazon,"" Mr. Wingo said. ""It's an unusual thing for Amazon to be out of something, but for the Echo, it's usually in stock just for a couple weeks before it goes out of stock for a few days — so it feels like they're having trouble making enough of the devices."" Mr. Wingo noted the Echo, which Amazon sells for $180 only through its own site, was selling for $200 to $300 on eBay. When the Echo was introduced in a goofy video in late 2014, on the heels of the failure of the Fire Phone, it was widely ridiculed. The Echo's utility was not obvious, and in its earliest incarnation, it seemed a bit of a ditz. But there are a couple of reasons it has earned such raves from users. First, it's simple to learn, and its voice-recognition capabilities are more intuitive than those of many other vocal assistants (like Apple's Siri or Google Now). More than that, it keeps gaining new powers. During an interview at a media event last week, Dave Limp, Amazon's senior vice president for devices, said the company created the Echo because it had seen interesting possibilities arising out of advances in microphone technology, speech recognition and cloud connectivity. Amazon's engineers spent years perfecting the device's unusual capabilities. Unlike competing assistants, the Echo can be activated hands-free from far across the room (Siri only works from a couple of feet away), and it can decipher your voice in noisy environments, even when it's playing music. Amazon also worked to make sure the device responded very quickly. ""Early on in the product, to play music took eight or nine seconds, and it's just unusable when it's like that,"" Mr. Limp said. ""Now it's often 1,000 milliseconds or 1,200 milliseconds."" The speed makes a crucial difference. Compared with the trudge of chatting with Siri, speaking to Alexa feels natural, closer to speaking to a human than a machine — and even when it gets your request wrong, which in your early days with the device will happen often, it doesn't feel like you have paid a huge penalty for trying. More important, just like the early iPhone, Amazon has managed to turn the Echo into the center of a new ecosystem. Developers are flocking to create voice-controlled apps for the device, or skills, as Amazon calls them. There are now more than 300 skills for the Echo, from the trivial — there is one to make Alexa produce rude body sounds on command — to the pretty handy. It can tell you transit schedules, start a seven-minute workout, read recipes, do math and conversions, and walk you through adventure games, among other possibilities. Makers of digital home devices like Nest are also rushing to make their products compatible with the Echo. Alexa can now control your Internet-connected lights, home thermostats and a variety of other devices. Hardware makers can also add Alexa's brain into their own devices, so soon you won't need an Echo to consult with Alexa — you could find it in your toaster, your refrigerator or your car. Amazon's open-platform strategy for the Echo calls to mind Amazon Web Services, its multibillion-dollar cloud business that also came out of left field to best competitors. ""It is patterned very much off of the successful formula that A.W.S. uses,"" Mr. Limp said. The Echo also ties in to Amazon's main business, its retail store. When you tell it to reorder popcorn, it gets your order through Amazon, of course. Still, Mr. Wingo noted that Amazon had so far kept the platform relatively open — other retailers and product manufacturers are free to build their own apps that will allow for interactions with their stores. The Echo is far from perfect. It still gets queries wrong and it still feels like it's missing potentially useful features. Mr. Limp concedes this. Amazon's teams keep working to add new tricks to the Echo, he said. The device also faces limited retail distribution — it's unusual enough that it would benefit from being displayed on shelves, but Amazon's retail rivals are unlikely to stock it anytime soon. (Some analysts have speculated that Amazon's retail plans may be an effort to show off its hardware.) Amazon would be wise to step on the gas because while the Echo has no direct competitors, a few may be emerging. Among them is SoundHound, a start-up that has been working on voice-recognition for more than a decade, which is now offering hardware makers access to its service. Within the next year, according to the company, lots of gadgets will be using SoundHound's software to talk to users. Do you want that? As I argued recently, the F.B.I.'s battle with Apple over encryption should prompt deep questions about a future of Internet-connected devices spread around our homes. Amazon has strong privacy protections in the Echo. It doesn't stream anything without the wake word and it has a physical mute button that electrically disconnects the microphone but, as with all groundbreaking technology, there is no doubt we are entering new territory here. Yet, the Echo is so useful it may be worth the gamble. Many in the industry have long looked to the smartphone as the remote control for your world. But the phone has limitations. A lot of times fiddling with a screen is just too much work. By perfecting an interface that is much better suited to home use — the determined yell! — Amazon seems on the verge of building something like Iron Man's Jarvis, the artificial-intelligence brain at the center of all your household activities. Who could say no to that?"
1,2016-03-09," Season 2 of Amazon's ""Bosch"" begins the way Season 1 did — with a car gliding down a Los Angeles hillside, the lights of the city twinkling in the background and a violent death just around the corner. No other current series is as conversant with the images, the moods and, sometimes, the clichés of Southern California noir. Harry Bosch, the old-school detective drawn from the novels of Michael Connelly, was on suspension at the end of Season 1; as the new season begins, he's shaving a six-month growth and returning to the job. (The season's 10 episodes will be available on Friday.) Soon he's embroiled in a case involving a dead porn-film producer, an abrasive Las Vegas strip-club owner (entertainingly played by Matthew Lillard) and the Armenian mob. Enhancing the old-Hollywood romanticism is a sultry blond widow (Jeri Ryan) who lives in a gated community with an overly friendly, seemingly naïve security guard (an excellent Brent Sexton). The homage to Robert Altman's ""The Long Goodbye"" couldn't be much clearer. The pleasures of ""Bosch"" are narrow but intense. Along with the fealty to California noir come a convincing realism and an avoidance of contrived, sensational story lines (though Bosch's teenage daughter and ex-wife do find themselves in jeopardy in the new season). The attention to the details of investigative work and the texture of cops' lives is impressive, and occasionally Bosch delivers a short lecture on some aspect of Los Angeles history as a bonus. The flip side of all that conscientiousness is that the show — developed by Eric Overmyer of ""Treme"" — never quite catches fire. It's highly satisfying but not often exciting. The producers, many with roots in European television, have gone for a modest tone and a slow-burn narrative that can feel more admirable than addictive. That doesn't take away from an excellent cast, which includes Jamie Hector and Lance Reddick of ""The Wire"" and Amy Aquino of ""E.R."" as Bosch's fellow cops. Best of all is the longtime character actor Titus Welliver (best known for ""Lost"" and ""The Good Wife"") as Bosch, giving soul to a character defined by his grouchiness, stubbornness and antiquity. On a show dedicated to nostalgia for former ways of life and storytelling, he's the most important throwback."
0,2016-03-10," Con Edison, a public utility that traces its roots to the 19th century, is trying to modernize its relationship with customers, aiming to make interactions with them as smooth as ones they would have with Amazon or Uber. A result, it hopes, will be lower energy bills. Under the effort, about 270,000 New York customers in Brooklyn and Westchester County will start receiving personalized reports about their energy use with recommendations on specific energy-related products — like a smart thermostat or rooftop solar system — that they can install to lower their bills. For the effort, Con Ed has embarked on a multiyear agreement with the home energy management company Opower to help better analyze residential energy use and upgrade communications with customers, both online and on paper. ""Everything you do online is simple, easy, convenient, and we just need to get there,"" said James Brennan, director of demonstration projects in the distributed resource integration department at Con Edison. ""We need to make it as simple and easy and efficient as we can, whether they're paying their bill, whether they're buying a thermostat, whether they're buying a TV."" Facing competition from alternative service providers — including cable companies offering wireless home energy management systems and upstarts selling rooftop solar — electric companies across the county are experimenting with ways to engage their customers and strengthen their relationships with them while helping them save energy. Among the most successful is a program at Duke Energy, one of the nation's largest utilities, with Tendril, an energy management company based in Boulder, Colo. Using home energy reports that explain to customers how their energy use compares with similar homes in their areas and how they might reduce that use, the program has saved more than a terawatt-hour of electricity since it started in 2010. That is enough to light more than one million homes for a year in the Duke Energy service territory, which covers parts of several states including Ohio, Indiana and the Carolinas, the company said. Suggesting behavioral changes like hanging the laundry out to dry once a week and using energy-efficient products and services, as well as sending out email alerts when weather patterns suggest a customer might use more energy than usual, has resulted in about 1 to 3 percent in savings each year, said Adrian Tuck, Tendril's chief executive. Executives at Duke, who developed and tested an energy savings program internally for two years before seeking an outside company to design and manage a larger-scale program, have been happy with the results. ""If we can get this cumulative effect from all of these customers taking the tips and putting them into action, certainly we're still going to have to build power plants, but it postpones the effort,"" said Kelly Kuehn, senior product and services manager at the utility. In New York, the program includes a demonstration project approved under the Reforming the Energy Vision, known as REV, from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who aims to remake the state's energy system and help utilities find new revenue sources. The demonstration project, called Connected Homes, is intended to increase customer adoption of energy-saving and energy-generating products. For the selected customers, the home energy reports might suggest installing a SunPower solar system or a Nest thermostat, which can be adjusted remotely. By matching customer usage and heating and cooling patterns with data like homeownership status and location, the Opower system can make it easier to promote the products to the households most likely to buy them. The effort, which will also include a website for customers to research and buy energy-efficient appliances, products and services, is expected to expand as Con Edison completes negotiations with other providers and introduces smart meters next year."
1,2016-03-10," (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good morning. Here's what you need to know: • White House hopefuls converge on Florida. Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton argued Wednesday night at the final scheduled debate in Miami over who would better represent Hispanic voters' interests, with the crucial state of Florida voting on Tuesday. Our reporter offers key takeaways from the debate. Who won? Pundits gave higher marks to Mr. Sanders. And here are video highlights. Both will campaign in Florida today. Tonight in Miami, it's the Republicans' turn to spar (8:30 p.m. Eastern, CNN and CNN.com). Ted Cruz is playing up his Cuban heritage in his bid for Marco Rubio's home state, but both candidates' chances of overtaking Donald J. Trump appear remote, according to the delegate count. • Parties look ahead to November. The Republican National Committee filed two lawsuits against the State Department to gain access to emails related to Mrs. Clinton's tenure as secretary of state. The Democratic National Committee is using digital ads to troll Mr. Trump over the lawsuits surrounding Trump University. • Mass shooting near Pittsburgh. Five people were killed and three were wounded in a shooting at a house party in Wilkinsburg, Pa., on Wednesday night, and the police are looking for two gunmen. • On Capitol Hill. Oratorical fireworks are expected today as the Senate Judiciary Committee convenes amid growing animosity over Republicans' refusal to consider any Supreme Court nominee put forward by President Obama.

U.S. officials say that an Islamic State operative captured in Iraq is a specialist in chemical weapons who has been explaining how the group weaponized mustard gas by loading a powdered form into artillery shells. That validates suspicions that the group used sulfur mustard, a banned substance, in Iraq and Syria. Separately, in New York, a federal jury has found a U.S. veteran guilty of attempting to join ISIS. It's the government's first trial victory against the group's sympathizers. • Obama calls out allies.

A far-right party called the Alternative for Germany is riding a wave of discontent over Chancellor Angela Merkel's embrace of more than one million refugees to their strongest poll ratings ever. This weekend's elections in three large German states are being watched as a referendum on refugee policies, and for signs of the angry populism running through Europe and the U.S. • The European Central Bank announced today that it would expand its bond-buying stimulus program and cut its benchmark interest rate to 0 percent, from 0.05 percent, to stimulate the wavering eurozone economy. • Volkswagen's chief of American operations is the latest executive to leave the automaker, which is dealing with the fallout from its diesel emissions scandal. • A must-have?

But one stands out. Fifty-five years ago, President Kennedy and his wife, Jacqueline, had perhaps the most majestic of all state dinners at Mount Vernon, George Washington's Virginia home. A fleet departed the Navy Yard and headed down the Potomac River, led by Kennedy's yacht, to the 18th-century colonial, which sits on a bluff overlooking the river. The Fife and Drum Corps put on a parade before the 138 guests, including President Ayub Khan of Pakistan, took a tour. Dinner was served under a candlelit tent with a spectacular view. The food was prepared at the White House and brought over in military vehicles; Mount Vernon did not have a modern kitchen or much electricity. The next year, Mr. Khan gave Mrs. Kennedy a black gelding as she was touring Pakistan. She brought it back to the U.S., where it became part of the Kennedy family stable.

2,2016-03-10," This week, Amazon revealed the location of its second brick-and-mortar bookstore, which will open in a few months in Southern California, at a mall near the University of California, San Diego. The online retailer seems to have big ambitions for its physical stores. On Wednesday, Nick Wingfield, who covers Amazon for The New York Times, visited the only Amazon bookstore in existence, in the University Village mall in Seattle. From inside the store, he had an online chat with Alexandra Alter, who writes about publishing for The Times. They discussed Amazon's strategy and how the retailer's stores differ from other bookstores. Here's what they had to say: ALEXANDRA ALTER: Hi Nick! You're reporting live from the mother ship! What's it like? NICK WINGFIELD: The best part is, I just tested the free Wi-Fi and it's 114 Mbps, easily the fastest I've ever gotten. Thank you, Jeff Bezos! ALEXANDRA: Great, so you can just buy stuff from the Amazon website while you're sitting in the store. Unlike Barnes & Noble, I bet Amazon doesn't mind if people browse in its store then go buy it online. NICK: Exactly. Here's the deal: At first glance, it looks like an ordinary but nice Barnes & Noble store. It's clean and well-lit and corporate. It doesn't have the charm of a funky used-bookstore. Once you start poking around the shelves, you notice the differences. ALEXANDRA: How is the selection different? How are the sections organized? NICK: They have 5,000 to 6,000 book titles, fewer than what you would find at a big Barnes & Noble. All of the books are arranged cover out, rather than spine out, in the belief that it makes browsing more friendly. I am so buying that ""Boho Crochet"" book. ALEXANDRA: Ha, I see Amazon is going big on adult coloring books — smart move since those have taken over the best-seller list on the website. Can you check something out for me? I heard that the store has a shelf of books recommended by Jeff Bezos. Is his wife MacKenzie's novel there? NICK: I'll go look now. O.K., I'm back. You were right! He does recommend his wife's book. He discloses his conflict of interest. But still … ALEXANDRA: Lucky guess. What else is he recommending? NICK: Kazuo Ishiguro's ""The Remains of the Day"" and ""Seveneves"" by the science-fiction writer Neal Stephenson, who incidentally used to work for Bezos's space exploration company, Blue Origin. ALEXANDRA: A man of diverse literary tastes. Here's another thing I'm curious about. A lot of people in the publishing industry were worried when they heard Amazon planned to open bookstores, in part because they assumed Amazon would heavily promote books published through its own imprints. Amazon has had trouble getting those books into brick-and-mortar bookstores, which don't want to sell books by its No. 1 competitor. But I've heard that the Amazon bookstore doesn't carry many Amazon Publishing titles. Is that how it looks to you? NICK: I just asked a store employee and was told there's no dedicated section for Amazon-published titles, though some of them are sprinkled around the store. There is, however, a small table near the front window called ""Books That Inspired Amazon Originals"" — that is, Amazon-produced TV series and movies. Philip K. Dick's ""The Man in the High Castle"" is there. That's corporate synergy at work. ALEXANDRA: It's like advertising for their shows, but they can sell the advertising. Here's my biggest question about the bookstore. Amazon already has a huge market share of physical book sales through its website, 60 percent, by some estimates. So why does it need physical stores at all? NICK: Amazon, officially, won't tell you much about the motivations for doing bricks-and-mortar. But what I gather from my reporting is they have a lot of ideas about how physical retailing can be improved, ideas that come from their data-centric approach to online retailing. There is also a serendipity to book shopping offline that's hard to replicate online. By the way, I just saw a customer walking around with a copy of Donald Trump's ""The Art of the Deal."" I don't know if he's purchasing it ironically. ALEXANDRA: An ironic purchase is still a purchase. I bet Trump and Amazon would agree on that. So, some Amazon skeptics have suggested that books are just going to be window-dressing and what Amazon really wants is a place to showcase its digital devices. Is there a prominent area for Amazon devices? NICK: Electronics, most of them made by Amazon, like Echo and Fire TV, are the nucleus of the store. They're spread out on tables and stands so you can fiddle with them just like you can fiddle with iPads at the Apple Store a short hop from here. Knowledgeable people tell me that Amazon views its physical stores as an important way to introduce the public to new, unfamiliar devices. Techies might be comfortable buying a device like the Echo online — a speaker and virtual assistant for the home — but a lot of people will want to see it in the flesh first. That said, I don't think Amazon stores would have saved the Fire Phone, the Amazon smartphone that belly-flopped. I should also say that books are not necessarily going to be the focus of all of the stores it opens in the future. Amazon intends to experiment. ALEXANDRA: Interesting. What else do you think it might sell in physical stores? Clothing? Pets? This is a company that delivers groceries and paper towels, makes award-winning television shows and wants to send tourists into space, so the possibilities seem pretty vast. NICK: I've heard food is one of the things they're considering. ALEXANDRA: One of the biggest questions right now is how many stores Amazon will open, and how quickly. A business professor speaking at a digital publishing conference this week speculated that it might open ""thousands"" of stores. There have been wild rumors that have sent other booksellers into a panic. What are you hearing? NICK: ""Thousands"" is a ludicrous number, at least in the short term. I've heard ""dozens."" Keep in mind that about 15 years after Apple opened its first store, it has fewer than 500 of them. ALEXANDRA:Still, even if the ambitions are modest in the short term, booksellers are definitely nervous about Amazon's entry into physical retail. Independent bookstores are actually thriving right now, in part because sales of print books have stabilized and e-book sales are down. Publishing experts say physical stores are still the No. 1 way to drive discovery of books. And as you said, people still like browsing for books in stores. They like the serendipity of it. But if Amazon gains ground in brick and mortar retail, independents will lose their biggest advantage. Are people are in there browsing right now? NICK: It's lunchtime on a weekday and there is no food for sale in the store, so there are not many people. The biggest question I have is, are malls the best place for these stores? It feels like a busy urban shopping area with lots of foot traffic might work better. ALEXANDRA: Nick, sorry to send you on another scavenger hunt, but can you check to see if Brad Stone's ""The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon"" is on the shelves? MacKenzie Bezos didn't like the book; she blasted it in a one-star review on Amazon. NICK: Wow, I just found it. They put it out of sight on a bottom shelf, but it's there."

0,2016-03-14," The beast that river-dwellers have long feared is coming later this week. It's a wave called Pororoca, the great roar, and its low bellow can be heard up to an hour before it arrives. It tumbles in from the ocean and travels up the Amazon on a path of destruction. While the region's residents accept the river's wrath and start moving their boats and animals, daredevils called bore riders grab their surfboards. This beast that they will ride is called a tidal bore, a wave that flows in from the ocean and propagates to dozens of rivers around the world. Along the Amazon, one of the strongest bore tides brings big waves that travel for miles and seem to last forever, perfect for a long ride. Local legend has it that three mischievous children travel up the Amazon playing practical jokes. But the scientific harbinger of this curse — or gift if you're a surfer — is that familiar force we call gravity. During new and full moons, when the river is relatively shallow and the ocean tide is high, water flows in from the Atlantic, rather than the other way around. As river and ocean collide, the Amazon's flow reverses and a water swell speeds upstream with incredible force. The strongest tidal bores occur on biannual equinoxes in September and March, when the sun, moon and Earth align; their combined gravitational pull brings ocean tides to their peak. A full moon on March 23 combined with the equinox means good news for bore riders like Serginho Laus, a surfer and Pororoca pioneer. He broke records in 2003 for his 33.25-minute, 6.3-mile ride along the pororoca of the Araguari, a river in the Brazilian Amazon basin. Surfing the Amazonian bore tides is dangerous, Mr. Laus says, not only because of their force — he compares it to a tsunami — but because these rivers carry the blood of a breathing jungle. You're the stranger in a land of jaguars, crocodiles, snakes, piranhas, parasites and tropical diseases. ""You can't go alone,"" he says. ""You need to have a crew, with boat pilots and locals that know the way of the river."" Even if you're not ready to ride, you can attend one of a number of festivals celebrating the Pororoca in Brazil this spring. The most famous is São Domingos do Capim in Para State. But Mr. Laus says he prefers the rawness of the river at Mearim in Maranhao State. ""We have the real Amazon beside us without cities, without people — just us and nature,"" he said. Dates depend on the moon and are still being announced, but you can learn about a few of the surfing competitions on this Facebook page and website."
1,2016-03-14," To the Editor: Re ""An Online Deal Just for You (Oh, and Everyone Else, Too)"" (front page, March 6): Books are one of the few, and probably most ubiquitous, consumer products for which the suggested retail price is printed right on the item itself. Online consumers have no firm list price reference to know if the seller is offering a real or false discount. So when Jeff Bezos opened a discount online store 22 years ago, he astutely decided to sell books, a product for which consumers would know the actual discount he or she was receiving because the list price was there for all to see. In the years before Amazon, the American Booksellers Association, publishers and booksellers debated the merits of what was termed ""net pricing,"" a pricing model in which booksellers purchased books from publishers at a flat rate; no prices appeared on the books themselves; and a bookseller was free to charge any price it wished. It was a model that favored traditional, regular-priced booksellers and discouraged discounting. Net pricing never caught on. Amazon's name and brand grew as a discount bookseller because it was selling a product that was undeniably being discounted. Had Amazon not found this retail foothold selling books, could it have begun to build its gigantic, devoted customer base by selling anything else? GARY FRANK  San Francisco The writer is founder and former owner of the Booksmith, a bookstore."
0,2016-03-17," AS a nation, we have become disciples of data. We interview 60,000 families a month to determine the unemployment rate, we monitor how much energy we use every seven days, Amazon ranks sales of every book it sells every hour. Then there is water. Water may be the most important item in our lives, our economy and our landscape about which we know the least. We not only don't tabulate our water use every hour or every day, we don't do it every month, or even every year. The official analysis of water use in the United States is done every five years. It takes a tiny team of people four years to collect, tabulate and release the data. In November 2014, the United States Geological Survey issued its most current comprehensive analysis of United States water use — for the year 2010. The 2010 report runs 64 pages of small type, reporting water use in each state by quality and quantity, by source, and by whether it's used on farms, in factories or in homes. It doesn't take four years to get five years of data. All we get every five years is one year of data. The data system is ridiculously primitive. It was an embarrassment even two decades ago. The vast gaps — we start out missing 80 percent of the picture — mean that from one side of the continent to the other, we're making decisions blindly. In just the past 27 months, there have been a string of high-profile water crises — poisoned water in Flint, Mich.; polluted water in Toledo, Ohio, and Charleston, W. Va.; the continued drying of the Colorado River basin — that have undermined confidence in our ability to manage water. In the time it took to compile the 2010 report, Texas endured a four-year drought. California settled into what has become a five-year drought. The most authoritative water-use data from across the West couldn't be less helpful: It's from the year before the droughts began. In the last year of the Obama presidency, the administration has decided to grab hold of this country's water problems, water policy and water innovation. Next Tuesday, the White House is hosting a Water Summit, where it promises to unveil new ideas to galvanize the sleepy world of water. The question White House officials are asking is simple: What could the federal government do that wouldn't cost much but that would change how we think about water? The best and simplest answer: Fix water data. More than any other single step, modernizing water data would unleash an era of water innovation unlike anything in a century. We have a brilliant model for what water data could be: the Energy Information Administration, which has every imaginable data point about energy use — solar, wind, biodiesel, the state of the heating oil market during the winter we're living through right now — all available, free, to anyone. It's not just authoritative, it's indispensable. Congress created the agency in the wake of the 1970s energy crisis, when it became clear we didn't have the information about energy use necessary to make good public policy. That's exactly the state of water — we've got crises percolating all over, but lack the data necessary to make smart policy decisions. Congress and President Obama should pass updated legislation creating inside the United States Geological Survey a vigorous water data agency with the explicit charge to gather and quickly release water data of every kind — what utilities provide, what fracking companies and strawberry growers use, what comes from rivers and reservoirs, the state of aquifers. Good information does three things. First, it creates the demand for more good information. Once you know what you can know, you want to know more. Second, good data changes behavior. The real-time miles-per-gallon gauges in our cars are a great example. Who doesn't want to edge the M.P.G. number a little higher? Any company, community or family that starts measuring how much water it uses immediately sees ways to use less. Finally, data ignites innovation. Who imagined that when most everyone started carrying a smartphone, we'd have instant, nationwide traffic data? The phones make the traffic data possible, and they also deliver it to us. The truth is, we don't have any idea what detailed water use data for the United States will reveal. But we can be certain it will create an era of water transformation. If we had monthly data on three big water users — power plants, farmers and water utilities — we'd instantly see which communities use water well, and which ones don't. We'd see whether tomato farmers in California or Florida do a better job. We'd have the information to make smart decisions about conservation, about innovation and about investing in new kinds of water systems. Water's biggest problem, in this country and around the world, is its invisibility. You don't tackle problems that are out of sight. We need a new relationship with water, and that has to start with understanding it."
0,2016-03-20," WASHINGTON — Ever since Jeff Bezos started the website Amazon to sell books, he has wrestled with how to deliver its products as quickly and cheaply as possible. Today, Amazon, now a retail giant, remains obsessed with this issue, building its own fleet of drones, buying trailers for trucks and signing up drivers for on-demand deliveries. And nowhere is the company's push to become a logistics and delivery powerhouse more evident than here in the nation's capital. Amazon has emerged as one of the tech industry's most outspoken players in Washington, spending millions on this effort and meeting regularly with lawmakers and regulators. Amazon has pushed officials to allow new uses for commercial drones, to extend the maximum length of trucks, to improve roads and bridges and to prop up a delivery partner, the United States Postal Service. The efforts are mostly in the early stages, but Amazon already has detractors, particularly for its drone efforts. Some drone makers argue that Amazon is pushing too hard, too fast. And airline and pilots groups have said opening the skies to more commercial drones, which are remote-controlled flying machines, could create safety risks. ""Amazon is disrupting huge industries; retail was a start, then the enterprise market with its cloud platform and now transportation logistics,"" said Colin Sebastian, a senior analyst at Robert W. Baird. ""This is Jeff Bezos's playbook, and achieving it by influencing legislation would be consistent with that plan."" The money Amazon spent on lobbying in 2015 nearly doubled, to $9.4 million, compared with the year before, which helped to pay a bigger lobbying staff and pay for a new office to house them. The tally, compiled from public records by the Center for Responsive Politics, includes only the spending that Amazon must legally disclose. Amazon's figure still lags those of some companies that made camp in Washington long ago, like Boeing, which spent about $21 million in 2015. And it trails the leading tech lobbyist, Alphabet, Google's parent, by several million. But Amazon's spending grew at a faster pace than any other big tech company's. When Paul Misener, Amazon's global head of policy, took over the company's Washington office 15 years ago, he had a staff of two focused on retail tax laws and other technology-related issues. Amazon now has more than 60 people listed as its lobbyists — both employees and contractors — double what it had just two years ago, according to the data from the Center for Responsive Politics. The lineup includes people as prominent as Trent Lott, the former Senate majority leader, who helps persuade members of Congress. Representatives for Amazon have met with lawmakers dozens of times in the last year. The efforts also reached NASA, the postal commission and the Department of Transportation, among others. Amazon and Mr. Bezos, its chief executive, have other interests in Washington, too. Amazon is now a major government contractor with a $600 million cloud computing partnership with the C.I.A. And Mr. Bezos's ownership of The Washington Post, which he bought in 2013, gives him a foothold in the political and media circles of Washington. Amazon declined requests to comment for this article. But on a recent earnings call, Amazon's chief financial officer, Brian Olsavsky, explained why Amazon wanted to move more aggressively into delivery. ""To properly serve our customers at peak, we've needed to add more of our own logistics to supplement our existing partners,"" Mr. Olsavsky said. ""That's not meant to replace them."" In addition, the company's shipping costs rose 19 percent, to $5 billion, in 2015. The millions of members of its Prime annual subscription service, Amazon's most frequent customers, have helped feed the surge. Those customers receive free shipping for many products. Some analysts expect Amazon eventually to take over its entire logistics chain — in some cases, from factory to doorstep. Just this month, Amazon signed a deal to lease 20 Boeing cargo planes. A few analysts got excited when Amazon referred to itself as a ""transportation service provider"" in a recent regulatory filing. The company, they suggested, could even become a competitor to UPS and FedEx. Mr. Olsavsky insisted on the call that UPS and FedEx would continue to be important partners. FedEx's chief executive, Fred Smith, also played down the possibility of Amazon becoming a rival. In a call with analysts and investors last week, he criticized ""fantastical"" reports about Amazon's challenge to logistics companies. Satish Jindel, founder of the SJ Consulting Group, which advises transportation and logistics firms, said, ""If my package doesn't get delivered to my expectations, most people don't think of FedEx or UPS."" He added, ""They think of the retailer, so Amazon is getting into drones and delivery to enhance the customer experience and have a bigger influence over the customer."" Already, the company's drone push in Washington has had some success. Amazon has worked with NASA, for example, to create an air traffic system that would establish lanes in the sky for drones. Amazon has also urged Congress to adopt rules that would allow the retailer to fly drones beyond a pilot's line of sight, a crucial hurdle to Amazon's goal of operating drones from its warehouses. This effort is expected to face an important test soon. This month, the Senate Transportation Committee drafted a bill that would ensure rules for delivery drones within two years. Airline and pilot groups have resisted many of Amazon's proposed changes. ""The chances of a collision will go way up when you have more unmanned aircraft up,"" said Chris Dancy, a spokesman for the Helicopter Association International, a trade group. Some drone makers said in interviews that Amazon's bold statements may be generating too much public angst, helping the safety advocates. Amazon is arguing for changes in many other areas, too. Already, Mr. Misener, the lead lobbyist, has called for an overhaul of an arcane system of international delivery rates that he says give foreign e-commerce rivals an unfair advantage to deliver to American homes. He also urged the approval of legislation that aims to improve roads, bridges and railways. The bill was passed by Congress and signed into law in December. ""The private sector cannot make all the necessary improvements"" in transportation, Mr. Misener said in July during a Senate hearing, a message that he has repeated to members of Congress. ""Government needs to keep up."" Amazon has backed a proposal for 33-foot twin-trailer trucks, vehicles that would extend the current legal length of trucks by several feet; opponents say longer trucks could make roads more dangerous for other drivers. ""The 33-foot trucks are going to be safer,"" Mr. Misener said last July, ""because there will be fewer of them on the road, driving fewer miles."" The proposal has been met with resistance from Ralph Nader, a longtime consumer advocate. He said he wrote Mr. Bezos, asking Amazon to stop its support of these trucks for safety reasons. He said Mr. Bezos never responded. The proposal was rejected last year as part of a broader transportation bill. ""Drones and longer trucks, what are all these efforts for?"" Mr. Nader said in an interview. ""To get you your toothpaste faster?"""
0,2016-03-25," SAN FRANCISCO — The resounding win by a Google artificial intelligence program over a champion in the complex board game Go this month was a statement — not so much to professional game players as to Google's competitors. Many of the tech industry's biggest companies, like Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft, are jockeying to become the go-to company for A.I. In the industry's lingo, the companies are engaged in a ""platform war."" A platform, in technology, is essentially a piece of software that other companies build on and that consumers cannot do without. Become the platform and huge profits will follow. Microsoft dominated personal computers because its Windows software became the center of the consumer software world. Google has come to dominate the Internet through its ubiquitous search bar. If true believers in A.I. are correct that this long-promised technology is ready for the mainstream, the company that controls A.I. could steer the tech industry for years to come. ""Whoever wins this race will dominate the next stage of the information age,"" said Pedro Domingos, a machine learning specialist and the author of ""The Master Algorithm,"" a 2015 book that contends that A.I. and big-data technology will remake the world. In this fight — no doubt in its early stages — the big tech companies are engaged in tit-for-tat publicity stunts, circling the same start-ups that could provide the technology pieces they are missing and, perhaps most important, trying to hire the same brains. Fei-Fei Li, a Stanford University professor who is an expert in computer vision, said one of her Ph.D. candidates had an offer for a job paying more than $1 million a year, and that was only one of four from big and small companies. On the candidate's list, one of the biggest technology companies was ranked lowest, in terms of both money and excitement, she noted dryly. At the University of Toronto, IBM pursued a start-up called Ross Intelligence that makes a smart legal assistant, and extended a free offer to use its A.I. software, called Watson. For IBM, the financial payoff would come if start-ups like Ross generated sales, followed by a revenue-sharing arrangement. ""No upfront costs at all,"" said Andrew Arruda, chief executive of the start-up, which moved last year to Silicon Valley. For years, tech companies have used man-versus-machine competitions to show they are making progress on A.I. In 1997, an IBM computer beat the chess champion Garry Kasparov. Five years ago, IBM went even further when its Watson system won a three-day match on the television trivia show ""Jeopardy!"" Today, Watson is the centerpiece of IBM's A.I. efforts. Now, Google's A.I. program is drawing additional attention and pointing to a consolidation among tech's biggest companies. By 2020, the market for machine learning applications will reach $40 billion, IDC, a market research firm, estimates. And 60 percent of those applications, the firm predicts, will run on the platform software of four companies — Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft. In January, before the Google software's latest Go victory, the scientific journal Nature published an article describing how the program had beaten a European Go champion in five consecutive matches, overshadowing an effort by another tech giant, Facebook, to promote its own powerful Go-playing A.I. software. Google's software went on to beat the Go grandmaster Lee Se-dol 4-1 in South Korea this month. IBM is making the broadest entry into A.I. Its Watson unit, set up as a separate division in early 2014, is both a software and a services business, with technology tailored to specific industries. More than 80,000 developers have downloaded and tried out the software, and the Watson division has 500 industry partners, including big companies and start-ups. ""It's early days, but the long-term goal is to have hundreds of millions of people use Watson as self-service A.I.,"" said David Kenny, general manager of the Watson division. In 2015, Amazon and Microsoft both added machine learning capabilities to their cloud software platforms, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. The companies are using machine learning software to help customers spot patterns and make predictions in vast amounts of data. Microsoft offers 18 machine learning services, including face recognition, text analysis and product recommendations. More A.I. capabilities, analysts say, should be announced at the end of the month, when Microsoft hosts a large conference for software developers in San Francisco. Google is opening its A.I. technology to outsiders, seeking to attract developers. Last November, Google made the core of the machine learning technology its engineers use, called TensorFlow, available as free-to-use open-source software. This week at a conference in San Francisco, Google showed off a new speech-to-text transcription service. The company also said its recently introduced vision software for identifying images would be broadly available soon, and it introduced new tools and training aids to help developers build machine-learning applications more easily. Intelligent software applications will become commonplace, said Jeff Dean, a computer scientist who oversees Google's A.I. development. ""And machine learning will touch every industry."" At Facebook, the A.I. vision is, at least for now, limited to its products. Mike Schroepfer, the chief technology officer, noted that Facebook's image-recognition software was now used to select what pictures or videos to show in a user's news feed, based on a person's friend network and interests. ""Before, the photo was a black box to us,"" he said. ""And that's the most likely form this takes — a lot of things that add up to make the service steadily better on Facebook."" If products come first, a platform strategy typically takes shape later for the big consumer web companies. There are millions of Facebook app developers worldwide. Today, only about 1 percent of all software apps have A.I. features, IDC estimates. By 2018, IDC predicts, at least 50 percent of developers will include A.I. features in what they create. ""It's where the market is headed,"" said David Schubmehl, an IDC analyst. The question remains, how quickly? To some, the rush to build platforms is taking place long before the technology has matured. What is more, they are still focusing on niches, said David B. Yoffie, a Harvard Business School professor. ""None of them have the opportunity to be as ubiquitous as an operating system became in the PC era, "" Mr. Yoffie said. Some start-ups, like Diffbot in Palo Alto, Calif., are willing to jump into the fray with industry giants under the assumption that there is still plenty to figure out. The company, which was founded by Mike Tung, a Stanford computer science graduate student, in 2008, recently raised $10 million to compete directly with Google. Even though Diffbot is still being run out of a home near the Stanford campus, Mr. Tung is thinking big. ""Our goal is to capture all human knowledge,"" he said. ""I would like for Diffbot to build an iconic company around data. There are companies focusing on computing, but there is no Amazon of data."""

0,2016-03-29," FALL RIVER, Mass. — For this former mill town, the deal to secure a large Amazon distribution center means much more than the $3.78 million coming from the land sale and the successful culmination of three years' worth of negotiations. ""Any time you have a corporate giant making a commitment to a city, that speaks volumes,"" said Kenneth Fiola Jr., executive vice president of the Fall River Office of Economic Development, which worked closely with state officials and the broker NAI Hunneman to bring in the online retailer. ""It gave us enhanced credibility."" Credibility to attract other large companies, for one thing. And the deal for an over one-million-square-foot distribution center also gives Fall River, a southeastern Massachusetts city of about 89,000 people, cash to tackle a long list of improvements planned for its downtown business district. It is the latest step in a strategy that Mr. Fiola and other civic leaders are pursuing to encourage urban investment and redevelopment. Like other former mill towns throughout the Northeast, Fall River necessarily refocused its economic base after the textile industry began departing in the 1990s. The city negotiated with the state and federal government for tax incentives to lure biomedical manufacturers and others into the area. ""You're seeing a city reinvent itself,"" said Robert A. Mellion, president and chief executive of the Fall River Area Chamber of Commerce. ""It didn't happen by accident. It's an effort to design and implement an economy that's sustainable for the long haul."" Local businesses, many in the health care sector, have also been growing, which is good news for James J. Karam, president and chief executive of the property firm First Bristol, which owns three buildings downtown. ""I have two 50,000-square-foot buildings that are 100 percent occupied by local firms,"" Mr. Karam said. He bought his third building, which is 100,000 square feet, from Travelers Insurance, which reduced its footprint and now leases 40,000 square feet from First Bristol. ""We're at 75 percent occupancy in the remaining space, up from 40 percent in just one year. It's been going quite well,"" he said. For its part, Amazon, which did not respond to requests for comment, is expected to hire 500 people when its $36 million warehouse opens this fall. The Trammell Crow Company is developing the project on 77 acres in the SouthCoast Life Science & Technology Park, one of three municipally owned industrial zones. It is a 10-minute drive north from Fall River's downtown. The city worked with the state to make the zones as attractive as possible: expediting development approvals, for instance, and improving site access by securing federal funds to build a new highway interchange off Route 24, which opened in 2012. ""The only permits that Amazon had to get were building permits,"" said Michael DiGiano, an executive vice president with NAI Hunneman. Cathy Minnerly, another NAI executive vice president who is also a principal, added: ""The fact it was shovel-ready was a very large point."" Shortly after the deal was announced in November, Fall River's redevelopment agency moved forward with rehabilitating Old Second Street, a 1960s-era pedestrian mall in the heart of downtown, by hiring an architectural firm based in Boston, Brown, Richardson & Rowe. The revival of this corridor fits neatly with the agenda of Fall River's newly elected mayor, Jasiel Correia II. Since taking office in January, Mr. Correia has reinitiated a matching grant program for downtown building owners who want to improve their facades. He also has hired the marketing firm Penrose Commercial, based in Boston and Providence, R.I., to plan a new strategy for selling vacant city-owned properties. Mr. Correia, who turned 24 shortly before taking office, aims to create a live-work-play environment downtown. His goal is to attract young professionals who might be priced out of Providence, another former mill city nearby that has successfully reinvented itself. ""I understand the challenges people my age are facing, the desires and opportunities that they have and want,"" he said. ""Fall River, a community with a lot of growth potential, is really prime for someone to take it by the horns and really start to develop it."" Developers are already doing just that. Construction began last fall on apartments within the mixed-use complex Commonwealth Landing. For the investors Anthony Cordeiro, Larry Couto and Alan Macomber, this $18 million project represents the third and final phase of redeveloping a 228,000-square-foot waterfront mill building originally occupied by Quaker Fabric. Mr. Cordeiro, Mr. Couto and Mr. Macomber bought the property at a bankruptcy sale in 2010. A combination of state and federal tax credits allowed them to construct offices, two restaurants and a training center for Bristol Community College within Commonwealth Landing's bottom two floors. The new 103 apartments within the building's top three stories will be the first exclusively market-rate multifamily housing built in Fall River for a generation. Mr. Cordeiro hopes that the units' high-end finishes like granite countertops and amenities like an adjacent river walkway will attract millennials and empty-nesters once the project is complete early next year. ""We'll retain as much of the original flooring, ceiling and brick walls as possible,"" he said. ""We're trying to raise the standards and get people who want to live and play all in the same area."" Work to remove an unsightly tangle of ramps that blocks downtown waterfront views should also finish in 2017. The $197 million project aims to reconstruct the interchange between Interstate 195 and State Route 79. The city also hopes to receive state approval this spring for $80 million for design and construction to reconfigure Route 79 just north of downtown, which would further improve harbor access and open 10 acres for mixed-use development. ""If you lived in the city before, you always dreamed about it,"" Mr. Cordeiro said of this redevelopment activity and the potential for more, ""but now we're living it."""
0,2016-03-30," When last we saw Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney in Amazon's ""Catastrophe,"" their unplanned pregnancy had led them beyond the altar to a honeymoon maelstrom — something about her gnarly toenails — that threatened to end things before they'd barely begun. Then her water broke. What calamities could Season 2 possibly bring? Fast-forward to a baby sister (with an unpronounceable Gaelic name) for toddler Frankie, and the attendant struggles, at least for Sharon: postpartum ick, a visiting monster-in-law (Carrie Fisher), a languishing career and a dearth of adult conversation. And sex, of course, or a lack thereof. (That last complaint would be Rob's.) But the six new episodes, streaming Friday, April 8, deliver that same, delirious turn-on-a-dime sparring — one minute, lovingly raunchy; the next, ready to rip each other's throats out — that makes Ms. Horgan's Irish teacher and Mr. Delaney's American ad man, consciously coupling in London, seem not too far a stretch from the rest of us."
0,2016-03-31," SEATTLE — Aaron Horn, an information technology director for the Iowa Interstate Railroad, recently decided to take convenience in his home to the next level. Instead of running out to the store whenever he and his family needed Tide laundry soap, he installed a wireless button on the back of a cabinet door in his house in Swisher, Iowa. With one press of that button — called an Amazon Dash Button and made by the giant e-commerce company — Mr. Horn could reorder Tide anytime he needed, and the online retailer would ship him detergent. Getting the button was about ""90 percent convenience,"" said Mr. Horn, adding that 10 percent of the motivation was ""wanting to play with innovative new tech."" Now, Amazon is about to make ordering a box of Trojan condoms — as well as Slim Jims, Doritos and more than 100 other consumer products — as unchallenging as Mr. Horn getting that Tide. A year ago, Amazon, which is perpetually inventing new ways to buy things while using the fewest calories possible, introduced the Dash Button with a single purpose: to let customers order mundane products like garbage bags and toothpaste by pushing a button. At first, many people thought the Dash Button — which is a plastic widget the size of a car key remote — was a joke, since Amazon introduced it just before April Fool's Day. The idea behind a device that lets shoppers buy one thing, and one thing only, also seemed a little wacky. The Dash Button is no joke. On Thursday, Amazon said it was expanding the program from the nearly 30 brands whose products have been available for ordering through the devices to more than 100. Now, Energizer batteries, Stayfree feminine pads and Zico Premium Coconut Water will each have their own Dash Buttons. Peet's Coffee, Red Bull beverages and Orville Redenbacher's Gourmet Popping Corn are joining the club too, as is Arm & Hammer cat litter. ""What we've heard from customers is they want more,"" said Daniel Rausch, director of Dash at Amazon. ""Brands have been clamoring to be in the program."" Mr. Rausch said the use of Dash Buttons had been growing at a steady clip. The number of orders customers made with the devices jumped 75 percent during a week in mid-March compared with a week in mid-December, he said, without disclosing the underlying sales numbers. Dash Buttons are now pressed more than once a minute in total by Amazon customers, Mr. Rausch said. Amazon charges its customers $4.99 per Dash Button, but refunds that same amount after their first order using the device, almost guaranteeing that customers use it at least once. The device is available only to people who pay for Amazon's $99-a-year Prime service, and items are delivered to customers with Prime's two-day free shipping. Each Dash Button has a strip of adhesive for sticking it somewhere around the house, and a colorful logo for Tide, Orbit gum or whatever brand the button exists to serve. The widgets are effectively in-home advertisements for the brands, leading some analysts to believe that the brands are subsidizing the cost of the Dash Buttons bearing their names — something Amazon will not confirm. Amazon's founder and chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, has been on a mission to eradicate every conceivable obstacle to shopping online since the 1990s, when he patented Internet ordering with a single mouse click. With the Dash Button, Amazon is removing the headache of one-click ordering on a PC or smartphone — as questionable as that burden may seem — and putting the button on a pantry wall, countertop or medicine cabinet. Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University's Stern School of Business, said Amazon would one day go even further by analyzing customer shopping patterns and proactively sending people replenishments of common household items. ""I think that's where this is all headed,"" he said. ""I will get a box once a week with stuff they figure I need."" Amazon, based in Seattle, received a patent a few years ago for ""anticipatory package shipping,"" a method of speculatively sending goods to customers before they have actually ordered them. And the company is also helping makers of washing machines, pet food dispensers and other products design them so that the products themselves can automatically order replenishments on their own. To some, the Dash Button is another symptom of a creeping societal laziness, though Mr. Galloway says he sees the device as no more insidious than a television remote control. One obvious risk of making online shopping so easy is inadvertent ordering. By default, the Dash Button won't allow a repeat order of a product until after an earlier order of the same item is delivered, a rule intended to prevent situations in which, say, a husband orders pet food right after his wife. But a child with a Dash Button can be a dangerous thing. Before Mr. Horn recently installed his Dash Button for Tide, one of his children got hold of it. ""When our 6-year-old picked it up, my wife and I both yelled 'Don't push the button!'"" Mr. Horn said. He was just in time: No unwanted shipment of Tide has shown up at his door."
0,2016-04-03," Caitlyn Jenner will appear on the next season of ""Transparent."" Jill Soloway, the creator and executive producer of the Amazon series, announced the casting at the GLAAD Media Awards on Saturday, according to The Associated Press. The show follows the tumultuous lives of a 70-year-old transgender woman and her family in Los Angeles. The main character, Maura Pfefferman, is played by the actor Jeffrey Tambor and has featured several transgender actors, including Alexandra Billings, Ian Harvie and Trace Lysette. Ms. Soloway said that Ms. Jenner would begin filming next week. The coming season, the show's third, is expected to arrive sometime this year. Ms. Jenner has her own reality show, ""I Am Cait,"" and appears on ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians,"" but she has had very few acting roles throughout her career. ""Transparent"" won the GLAAD award on Saturday for comedy series, while ""I Am Cait"" won for reality show. Lilly Wachowski, the filmmaker formerly known as Andy, in her first public appearance since coming out as transgender, accepted the award for TV movie for ""Sense8."""
0,2016-04-04," Michael C. Fina helped popularize bridal registries, and its Park Avenue store was a destination for Manhattan elites. It provided silver for John F. Kennedy's inauguration festivities and catered to the likes of Frank Sinatra and Lennox Lewis. But with foot traffic falling more than 80 percent in the last decade, the writing on the wall became clear: If you can't beat Amazon, join Amazon. On April 16, Michael C. Fina, which had sales of $16 million last year, will close its sole brick-and-mortar store, laying off about 20 workers and bringing to an end an 81-year run in Manhattan. Instead, the retailer is moving entirely online, including teaming with Amazon.com as part of a planned revamping of the e-commerce giant's wedding registry service. ""The initial reaction was definitely: 'What are you, nuts? How do you have a retail business, and no store?'"" said Steven Fina, 35, current president and the grandson of the retailer's founder. ""But we've seen in our own lives that the way we shop has changed,"" he said. Michael C. Fina is hardly the first retailer to buckle to the ever-mounting shift of shopping to the web. But the company is one of the most storied retailers to take its business online-only as a way to survive. The luxury store's deal with Amazon provides a glimpse into one way the online retail giant is bolstering its luxury offerings. Michael C. Fina's wedding registry page on the new site will offer high-end brands, like Baccarat and Buccellati, that have so far been loath to make their goods officially available on Amazon. The partnership also illustrates how deeply Amazon has woven itself into the business of independent merchants. In recent years, the company has experienced huge growth in a service it calls Fulfillment by Amazon, in which independent sellers pay Amazon to hold and ship their products, which extends to customers the fast delivery benefits of Amazon's Prime membership. Through its fulfillment service, Amazon shipped more than a billion items to customers last year, and the number of sellers using the program grew over 50 percent from the previous year. Amazon has a standard fee structure for independent merchants that use its fulfillment services, with the amount varying based on the weight and dimensions of the item. It is unclear how the Michael C. Fina brands and products will stand out on the sprawling site. An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment about Michael C. Fina, but provided an invitation to an event on April 12 in New York to introduce the new wedding registry site. The invitation said the new site would provide gift ideas in 15 categories, including flatware, cookware, home décor and appliances. The site will feature collections of products including Le Creuset cookware sets, Sonos speaker systems and Black & Decker tools. For Michael C. Fina, going online-only was a difficult yet inevitable choice, Mr. Fina said. The retailer already operates an e-commerce site, but it can take up to 72 hours for a product to be shipped. ""In this day and age, we recognize the fact that was too long,"" he said. Amazon has told him that its fulfillment centers will be able to ship an order in as little as two hours. Mr. Fina also said he expected shipping costs to fall by as much as 50 percent, because of Amazon's economies of scale. A change in the habits of wedding registry shoppers beyond buying online made it imperative for Michael C. Fina to join platforms that offered a more diverse range of registry choices. The company will also offer its wares on Zola.com, an online wedding registry start-up, and it will continue to sell through its own site. Shan-Lyn Ma, founder of Zola.com, said that because couples in the United States were marrying much later than ever, and because they increasingly lived with their partners before tying the knot, their wedding gift needs had shifted away from the housewares and appliances that traditionally went toward setting up a first home. ""Couples are really starting to value experiences rather than straight wedding products you might have seen in our mothers' and grandmothers' wedding registries,"" Ms. Ma said. On Zola.com, couples can list hiking trips, hot air balloon rides and food delivery subscriptions, as well as funds for puppies, honeymoons and even fertility treatments. Zola, started in 2013 by Ms. Ma, a former executive at Gilt, the flash-sales site, has also spent the past year courting Casper mattresses, Sonos wireless audio systems and other brands popular among young adults. But she has since realized that many couples want to add a few traditional items into their wedding registry mix. And a partnership with Michael C. Fina, she said, gave Zola access to brands that the site might have trouble courting. ""Baccarat, Georg Jensen: Michael C. Fina has longstanding relationships with brands that we don't currently offer,"" she said. ""We're seeing a lot of high-low mixing."" Mr. Fina said that the retailer's merchants, marketing team, graphic designers and other back-office employees would largely keep their jobs. Most of the job losses would occur on the sales floor, he said, and the retailer would assist those laid off in finding new jobs in retailing. The company told its employees on Monday. ""This was the most difficult part of our decision,"" said Mr. Fina, who runs the retailer with his two brothers and a cousin. ""Some of these people have worked for us for decades; they've been so loyal."" He added: ""But we're doing this because this is what our customers are telling us. We may be 80 years old, but we have to stay ahead of the curve."""
0,2016-04-06," Love is a mess. It's awkward and clumsy and can lead to the uncomfortable gestation of a small human. This was the theme of the splendid first season of the British comedy ""Catastrophe,"" about Rob (Rob Delaney), an American businessman, and Sharon (Sharon Horgan), an Irish schoolteacher, whose several-night stand in London produced an unplanned pregnancy and, eventually, romance. It was a ribald story about grown-ups backing into love with few illusions and fewer boundaries. But if love between two adults is a mess, consider what happens when you throw in a couple of dependents who do not have control of their excretory functions. This is where the equally sweet and filthy Season 2, appearing Friday on Amazon Prime, finds the couple. Specifically, it finds them in bed, a couple of years later, she hugely pregnant, he trying to coax her into a quickie. ""My old-lady bra turns you on?"" she asks. ""It's like being in bed with one of my aunt's friends,"" he says. ""It feels dirty and wrong."" It may be early for them to be having another baby. (Their first was born on their wedding night, and Sharon is still in Rob's iPhone contacts as ""Sharon London Sex."") But ""Catastrophe"" believes in steering into the skid. Life will chuck more problems at you anyway, so what the hell, might as well throw another on the pile. Where the first season was frank about the physical pitfalls of pregnancy, the second gets real about early parenting, which is 90 percent about the management of bodily discharges. (Along with diaper humor, the show breaks new ground in lactation slapstick.) Meanwhile, Sharon's father (Gary Lilburn) is beginning to show signs of dementia, and Rob's self-involved mother (Carrie Fisher) has arrived for an extended and unhelpful visit. Rob continues to hate his job making ads for a comically evil pharmaceutical firm. Sharon, on a generous British maternity leave, is annoyed by the ""mom-bies"" in her mothers' group and finds herself staring at her smartphone while pushing her child in a swing, muttering, ""I hate myself."" Mr. Delaney and Ms. Horgan share writing duties, emphasizing their characters' sharp-tongued camaraderie. Ms. Horgan is a comic actress, while Mr. Delaney is a comedian who happens to be acting, but they have a natural rapport. They joke splendidly and fight even better. Without soapboxing, ""Catastrophe"" is also casually feminist, partly for illustrating Anne-Marie Slaughter's point that an equal marriage requires Dad to be more than the backup parent. It's Rob who's tempted by the idea of quitting work to stay home, though they need his income; Sharon is desperate to return, though child care would cancel out her paycheck. ""So you want to go back to a job that takes you away from your kids to earn no money,"" he says. She smiles: ""Bingo!"" ""Catastrophe"" has the raw honesty of a mom on her second martini at a play date. It's also — time-strapped parents take note — a refreshingly brisk six episodes. Even at that, some subplots feel extraneous, and like the first season, the second ends on a dissonant cliffhanger. But ""Catastrophe"" has not become a dramedy about parenting. It's a comedy about being parents, weathering the emotional and medical terrors that come with responsibility for small lives, yet remaining partners, lovers, allies. On one of the rare occasions when someone gives Rob and Sharon useful advice, Sharon's mother (Frances Tomelty) tells them that, when she and her husband had kids, ""We decided that we had to put our love for each other above everything else, because we were man and wife before we were mother and father."" They agree that she's out of her mind. But later Rob echoes the idea, in his way, telling Sharon that he's more proud of their marriage than of their child-rearing. ""Who doesn't want to take care of their kids?"" he says. ""You'd have to be a monster not to want to do that. But this? Maintaining this — this is the slog."" So they go forth together, hand in hand into the muck."
0,2016-04-08," International markets are a growth opportunity for many American technology companies. The problem is that many of those markets are highly unpredictable. The latest tech company to experience that fickleness is Amazon. In recent days, it has encountered bumps in one of its most potentially lucrative emerging markets, India. That's because India recently issued new rules around foreign ownership of e-commerce companies operating in the country — and Amazon and some of its rivals appear to have run afoul of those rules, write Nick Wingfield and Vindu Goel. While the impact of this on how Amazon operates in India is unclear, it's a bad time for the Internet retailer to face hurdles in the country. India is a fast-growing economy that offers the opportunity to gain millions of new e-commerce customers. Amazon faces competition there from other web retailers such as Snapdeal, so any loss of momentum in the country could potentially be costly. The difficulties of navigating growth in international markets are by now well known, especially for American tech companies in India's neighbor, China. There, numerous tech companies have tried to make inroads and been shut out, or were never permitted to operate in the first place. Even tech companies that have tried their darnedest to be friendly with Chinese authorities have later faced regulatory challenges."
1,2016-04-08," SEATTLE — For Amazon, no country is more important to its global growth ambitions than India, the second-most-populous nation in the world behind China, where online shopping is in its infancy and growing explosively. But Amazon's India plans just ran into a hitch. Late last month, the Indian government issued additional rules governing foreign ownership of e-commerce companies operating in the country. The government added regulations related to pricing and the sourcing of sales on sites that Amazon and several rivals appear to violate. What is more, the new policy was effective immediately, giving Amazon and others no time to comply. ""They've not given any timeline for enforcement,"" Satish Meena, an analyst at Forrester Research in India. ""There's no proper instructions to companies about how to implement these things. That's a very open-ended question the government has left."" A trade group representing the Internet companies is considering sending a letter asking the Indian government for clarification or to delay enforcement of the rules until September. Analysts and Internet executives in India say they do not expect an immediate government crackdown on Amazon and others, and it is not yet clear what the consequences would be for breaking the new rules. But the regulations were at least helpful to Amazon and its rivals because India finally clarified its murky policies regarding foreign-owned e-commerce companies. Uncertainty is part of the tumult of doing business in India, which has had a flood of foreign investment in its Internet commerce sector and a corresponding wave of opposition from politically powerful domestic retailers. Online spending in India is expected to jump to nearly $75 billion by 2020 from a mere $12.1 billion last year, as more of the country's 1.25 billion people get on the Internet, according to Forrester. The stunning growth projections have led executives at Amazon, the e-commerce giant, to predict that India could be its second-largest market after the United States within a decade. In 2014, the company's chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, stood atop a bus in Bangalore wearing a jodhpuri-style Indian coat and holding a giant check for $2 billion, representing the amount Amazon pledged to plow into its business in the country. ""With a growing middle class and propensity to shop online, the revenue potential there is enormous,"" said Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Company. As in the United States, in India brick-and-mortar retailers have expressed alarm at the growth of e-commerce, and they have sued the Indian government to compel it to place more restrictions on the industry. For Amazon there is a special urgency to get India right after fumbling attempts to crack the e-commerce business in China, another huge emerging market dominated by domestic players. From the day it started in India in 2013, Amazon had to make big changes to comply with its restrictive rules governing retailing. India essentially bars companies with substantial foreign ownership from operating retail outlets that sell from their own inventories of goods. Although American multinationals like Amazon, Walmart and Apple have sought to overturn or soften those restrictions, the government has made few changes. To work around the restrictions, Amazon and competitors billed themselves as e-commerce marketplaces, eBay-like websites that matched buyers with independent sellers. Amazon owns no inventory of its own in India, though it handles the warehousing and delivery of goods for many of its independent sellers, a model it also employs in the United States. Last week, Indian regulators confirmed that online marketplaces, which had operated in a gray era, are legal. But they added a rule saying that no single seller can account for more than 25 percent of sales on such an e-commerce marketplace. It also limited the influence that online marketplaces can exert over the prices set by their sellers. The new regulations appear to make Amazon's dependence on one large seller on its site, Cloudtail, illegal, according to industry officials and analysts. While Amazon says it has more than 80,000 sellers on its India site, Cloudtail is estimated to account for 40 percent to 50 percent of the site's sales, according to Mr. Meena of Forrester. The parent company of Cloudtail is a partnership between Catamaran Ventures, the investment firm of the Indian business magnate, N.R. Narayana Murthy, and Amazon, which owns 49 percent. India's leading e-commerce company, Flipkart, also works closely with an affiliated large seller and faces a similar problem. The agency that issued the new rules, the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, declined to comment on whether any violations had occurred. Ishtiyaque Ahmed, a director of foreign collaboration at the agency, said he was not familiar with the details of the two companies' business arrangements ""so I cannot discuss a hypothetical situation."" Amazon is still evaluating the new rules, said Craig Berman, a company spokesman. ""Through our amazon.in marketplace, we will continue to help small and medium businesses in India connect with consumers,"" Mr. Berman said in a statement. Flipkart declined to comment. One obvious course of action for Amazon is to form more joint ventures with Indian companies to reduce its reliance on any single seller like Cloudtail. Arjun Narayan, managing director of Catamaran Ventures, Amazon's partner in Cloudtail, said in an email that he did not expect any ""abrupt business changes"" for Cloudtail. Snapdeal, one of the largest e-commerce companies, which has no large sellers, welcomed the regulations."
0,2016-04-09," Over the last several years, growth stocks, like Amazon and Netflix, have brought much momentum to the market. But in the first quarter, those kinds of stocks lost some of their sizzle, as old-school dividend payers came back into favor. That is where three of the quarter's top-performing mutual funds found some of their better stock picks. The Artisan Value fund does not always invest in dividend payers, but the stocks the managers prefer — those attached to companies with strong financials and sturdy businesses — do tend to pay dividends, said the co-manager George O. Sertl. The Artisan managers operate very much in the style of Warren E. Buffett, the country's best-known value investor. They aim to buy stocks trading below their estimate of the fundamental value. Cheapness is not enough, though. A company must also have a durable, defensible business and a burly balance sheet. That is not to say they avoid wading into situations that some investors might consider scary. Part of their strategy is to hunt in sectors where ""fear and anxiety"" have depressed prices, Mr. Sertl said. Thus, a couple of years ago, they bought gold-mining stocks — a first for their 10-year-old fund. ""Gold and gold stocks went into a horrific bear market, and that's when we got involved,"" he said. ""Goldcorp peaked at $55 in 2011 and bottomed out in January at under $10."" The stock ended up being one of the fund's better-performing holdings in the first quarter. A period of disfavor for media companies likewise drew the fund's managers into CBS and Time Warner shares, which also have done well lately. Some consumers have been dropping cable TV in favor of online video streaming, and media companies have responded by offering ""skinnier bundles"" of services and channels, Mr. Sertl said. That could mean less revenue, which has prompted some investors to scurry away. But Mr. Sertl said he and his colleagues believed that companies with popular programming, like CBS's sports broadcasts and the Time Warner division HBO, would continue to thrive. ""Some people say, 'Content is king,' and we believe that,"" he said. ""If you have good content, you'll be able to monetize it."" The Artisan fund, whose investor shares have an expense ratio of 1 percent, returned 6.38 percent in the first quarter, compared with 1.35 percent for the S.&P. 500. As its name suggests, the SunAmerica Focused Dividend Strategy Portfolio explicitly targets dividends. It does so via a rules-based strategy that its managers follow strictly, said Tim Pettee, lead manager. The fund owns 30 stocks. They are the so-called Dogs of the Dow — the 10 constituents of that famed stock gauge with the highest dividend yields — plus 20 more stocks rated by the managers' financial model as the best dividend payers in the Russell 1000 index. (For that second group, the fund excludes financial companies and utilities.) ""I wish I could change the name of the Dogs of the Dow because these are not doggy companies — they're high-quality American brands,"" Mr. Pettee said. The fund's holdings include such well-known names as Caterpillar, Gap, Staples and Walmart. The managers assemble the portfolio annually and replace a stock in the interim only if its yield falls below the median yield of the S.&P. 500 or if a company is taken over, Mr. Pettee said. Otherwise, they leave the holdings alone. ""A big part of our success is the fact that we reconstitute the fund only once a year,"" he said. ""That cuts down on our opportunities to make mistakes."" The strategy has led to the fund owning an abundance of companies in traditional sectors like industrials and energy, and fewer in higher-flying ones like health care and information technology. But as tech companies mature, more of them are finding their way into the fund — and even more will most likely end up there in the future, Mr. Pettee said. ""Think about Apple,"" he said. ""It declared a dividend in 2012, so it's now in my world. It didn't score well in our model — the valuation was too rich — so it's not in the portfolio. But I'm looking forward to the day when I own Apple as a Dog of the Dow. ""Microsoft was the Apple of the '80s, and in 2013, we bought it as a Dog of the Dow."" The SunAmerica fund, whose A shares have an expense ratio of 1.07 percent, returned 6.29 percent in the first quarter. Strict screens also govern the way that the managers of the Deutsche Croci Equity Dividend fund select their holdings, said Di Q. Kumble, lead manager. Croci (pronounced ""croaky"") stands for ""cash return on capital invested,"" she said. That is a measure that Deutsche Asset Management, a division of Deutsche Bank, developed to compare stocks across industries and countries. It was conceived as an improvement over traditional measures like the price-to-earnings ratio, Ms. Kumble said. ""Earnings are based on accounting numbers,"" she said. But accounting rules can vary across industries and countries, making earnings and thus P/E ratios tough to compare. ""With Croci, we make adjustments to transform accounting reports into economic values,"" she said. The fund's managers apply a series of screens to winnow their potential holdings from among large-cap domestic stocks. ""We start with the S.&P. 500 and exclude financials and any stock that pays no dividend,"" Ms. Kumble said. The managers then seek stocks with low financial leverage and low price volatility as well as above-average dividend yields and low prices based on their proprietary calculations. All of the stocks they buy are given an equal weight in the portfolio, and they are rebalanced and, as needed, replaced quarterly. The methodology produces a portfolio that can yield picks that might seem surprising when viewed via traditional metrics. Consider Exxon Mobil and Coca-Cola, Ms. Kumble said. Back in 2013, Coke had a price-to-earnings ratio of 19, while Exxon's was 12. ""So on the surface, Exxon was cheap,"" she said. ""But our Croci economic P/E was higher for Exxon Mobil than Coke. So our methodology said Coke was actually the cheaper stock."" The Croci approach made a number of adjustments, including, for example, counting Coke's advertising and brand as assets, which differs from the traditional approach, Ms. Kumble said. Coke was also among the fund's most recent reported holdings, though Exxon Mobil was not. Apple, too, was a holding. The Deutsche fund, with a net expense ratio of 1.08 percent, returned 6.45 percent in the first quarter."
0,2016-04-10," SAN FRANCISCO — Imagine building an enormous beach resort, maybe the best in the world. Instead of renting the rooms, you charge guests based on the grains of sand they touch. You charge very little per grain, but if they lie on enough of them, it adds up. That is one way to think about what is going on at the world's biggest cloud-computing companies. Instead of grains of sand, think about computing cycles, the activity that goes on in a computer server that is running software. For a price, think about one line of software code for two one-millionths of a penny. When tolls that tiny are paid often enough, they can make a billion-dollar business. At Amazon Web Services, which pioneered this method late last year, there is no charge for the first million times a customer runs code. Thereafter, A.W.S. charges by the million times, or for the hundreds of milliseconds the computer is used. ""The scale at which we operate allows us to do innovative things,"" said Matt Wood, general manager of product strategy at A.W.S. ""When we get better economies of scale, we'll use that to our advantage."" This economics of tiny things demonstrates the global power of the few companies, including Microsoft and Google, that can make fortunes counting this small and often. In other words, you have to be really big to worry about making money off things that are really tiny. Google charges pennies for search ads and spends $9.9 billion annually building out a global computing business. Given enough software, in the realm of millionths of pennies, it could do even better. Good luck to any new entrant without the scale of these tech giants, however, as customers come to expect that sort of cheap metering. Cloud-computing companies are not the only ones focused on the small. Banks, of course, have for years been content taking a sliver of big transactions, so long as there are many of them. Uber, which enables private cars to temporarily become taxis, can monitor drivers and riders to adjust prices and routes, changing the value of things throughout the day. An auto insurance company called Metromile charges customers based on how many miles they drive a year. As tech companies get better at measuring things, other businesses can pick up on the techniques, and the fine counting at the big clouds augurs for more precise measurements and pricing everywhere. Mitch Hedberg's joke about rice being a good meal when you are hungry for 2,000 of something may turn out to be a prophecy. A.W.S. was an early leader in public cloud computing, or renting access to computing equipment or software over an Internet connection. It started in 2006 as a barely noted fluke by Amazon. It now has over two million computer servers and a million customers, including Netflix, Shell and Brooks Brothers. Last week, Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, gave A.W.S. a long acknowledgment in his annual shareholder letter, declaring that eventually most of the world will run on clouds like his. The per-millionth pricing began last November, in the A.W.S. product Lambda. Lambda runs a customer's line of code in response to a request, like looking up a ZIP code when given an address. Customers never rent servers, but pay for the moments of computing. Microsoft last month announced that it would have its own ""serverless"" product. Google has something similar in early release, which is likely to be a product by the third quarter of this year. Microsoft is even trying to do A.W.S. one better by microslicing the cost to rent some of its software licenses into the minutes of actual use. ""We're renting the sand and charging for the sun's UV rays that hit you,"" said Scott Guthrie, who runs Microsoft's cloud. For the big clouds, microslicing is also a way of coping with a tough task: Customers have to feel like they can rent all the computing they want, and the providers must always run at near full capacity. If someone is using cycles, and not whole machines, more people can be packed in. ""The secret to cloud economics is utilization — every minute unsold is money you don't get back,"" said Greg DeMichillie, the head of product for Google's cloud. ""There are very few of us who can work at this scale."" Like any important new tech trend, the microsliced, serverless model is already attracting investors and start-ups eager to work in the new world — and in this case, wary of what the giants will do next. An Oakland, Calif., company called Serverless makes software that other engineers can use to develop products for computing in Lambda and its ilk. ""We think this could be the focal point of A.W.S., even though I have no idea how they make money charging this little,"" said Austen Collins, the founder of Serverless. One way they make money is by adding on other products and servers. So does Mr. Collins think A.W.S. could thwart his business? ""It's a mistake to think Amazon won't be in everything,"" he said. ""We don't say, 'What if Amazon does it?' We assume they will, and try to do something a little better and faster."""
0,2016-04-13," SEATTLE — When Amazon introduced Kindle, its pioneering e-reader, in 2007, society was on the cusp of being changed by mobile devices. The iPhone had only just come out, and in the years to come smartphones and tablets asserted themselves as the primary devices for people who wanted to communicate, play games, browse the web and get stuck in the flytrap of social media. But Amazon's Kindles, which now seem quaint in their singular focus on reading, found their niche. And on Wednesday, the company introduced its eighth-generation Kindle for people willing to pay a tidy sum for an ultralightweight device that is meant for reading and not much else. The product, Kindle Oasis, will cost $289, placing it at the very top of Amazon's family of e-readers. The previous top-of-the-line e-reader, Kindle Voyage, is $200. Kindle Oasis is very light, weighing just 4.6 ounces — about 20 percent less than any other Kindle. For comparison, the latest iPad Mini is more than 10 ounces. Amazon is charging a premium for Kindle Oasis because it comes with a leather case containing a battery that significantly extends the charge time of the device. Magnets in the battery pack on the cover solidly click together with the Kindle Oasis. With the cover, Kindle Oasis gets ""months and months"" of battery life, more than any other device in the family. Without it, it lasts weeks, Amazon says. In an interview at Amazon's headquarters last week, David Limp, the senior vice president in charge of the company's devices business, said that Amazon's Kindle business was still growing, despite all the challenges it faced from other mobile devices. Mr. Limp said there was enduring appeal for a dedicated reading device that is a sanctuary from the hailstorm of distractions on other gadgets. ""There's nothing wrong with reading on a phone or a tablet but in the modern world, when you read on a tablet, you are bombarded,"" he said. ""Incoming email. I might get a notification, a text message from my family. I might get a notification from Clash of Clans. It takes away from our original vision, which is to get lost in an author's story."" It's worth noting that Amazon has no qualms about bombarding people electronically since it makes the Fire family of general-purpose tablets, and used to offer a Fire phone that did not succeed with consumers. Kindle Oasis is all about reading, though. The device has an unusual asymmetrical back, which substantially thickens the device on one side. When the device is held, the slope between its two thicknesses acts as a grip for the hand. Mr. Limp compared it to the spine of a book. Holding the Kindle Oasis is more comfortable than holding any other Kindle, but Amazon has accomplished that partly by moving some of its battery capacity out of the device proper and into its cover. Kindle Oasis comes with Amazon's Paperwhite display, which closely mimics the resolution of print. At $289, the new e-reader is likely to appeal only to the staunchest electronic book fans. The least expensive Kindle costs $80. One hard-core reader, Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, could not quite contain his excitement after seeing the device last week. Mr. Limp said he was with Mr. Bezos when his boss did the very un-Amazon thing of tipping the world to the imminent arrival of a new Kindle over Twitter. Amazon is normally extraordinarily secretive about such things. ""He's very passionate about reading,"" Mr. Limp said."
1,2016-04-13," Amazon has some unbelievable bargains on its virtual shelves. A cat litter pan with a list price of $2,159 can be yours for a mere $28. A bag of doggy treats, normally $822, is only $8. A windshield wiper blade, which the unwary pay $1,504 for, has been knocked down 99 percent. You say you don't believe that a plastic cat pan could ever have been sold to anyone for a couple of thousand bucks? Or that a six-ounce bag of Zuke's Lil' Links pork and apple sausage bits ever cost more than dinner at a five-star restaurant? It's all part of the bizarre world of Internet ""discounts,"" which let retailers and brands assert that you are getting a stupendous deal because someone somewhere else — exactly where is never explained — is being charged much more. The root of some of these so-called discounts is a phenomenon known as list price (also known as manufacturer's suggested retail price, or M.S.R.P., and by various other names), which The New York Times documented in a recent article. List price is a largely fictitious concept, promoted by the brand or manufacturer and adopted by the retailer to compel the customer into pushing the buy button. So if you are the sort of consumer who cares about such things, how can you guard against such pressure? When does e-commerce deliver on low prices, and when is it merely coasting on its reputation? These are particularly significant issues now, as Internet retail shifts from being mostly about price to being largely about convenience. That will make it much harder for customers to judge independently if they are getting a deal or merely being encouraged to think so. First, realize that the problem is at least as pervasive online as offline — and even less regulated. California, which has relatively strict laws about deceptive advertising, brought a successful case against Overstock.com for illusory discounts. But authorities elsewhere seem to have little interest. Over the last month, more research has been done on the shadowy world of Internet discounts that underline how random or even whimsical list prices are. Boomerang Commerce, a retail analytics firm, compared the list prices of dozens of pet items on Amazon and the specialist pet site Chewy.com. In only a handful of cases did the retailers even agree on what the list price was. So a 22-pound bag of Blue Buffalo Basics Limited Ingredient Grain-Free Duck and Potato dog food had a list price of $131 on Amazon and $84 on Chewy. Yet the retail price at both sites was the same: $49.49. ""A perceived deeper discount creates a higher conversion event — in other words, more buyers,"" said Boomerang's chief executive, Guru Hariharan, who previously worked at Amazon. Blue Buffalo declined to comment and Chewy did not respond to messages seeking comment. Amazon removed the $131 list price for the dog food and the 99 percent deals I asked about. An Amazon spokesman, Craig Berman, declined to answer any questions. Another consultant, Ripen eCommerce, analyzed 746,000 product searches on Amazon. Ripen's goal was to help third-party clients who sell on the giant retailer jockey for a better position — say, on the first page of results rather than further back. A little over 44 percent of the products — some sold directly by Amazon, others by third parties — were billed as discounted, Ripen said. ""It's less than I expected, actually,"" said Dave Rekuc, Ripen's director of marketing. ""Considering you can basically name your own list price."" Vendors enter the list price into their Amazon data, which makes the system a self-regulating one, Mr. Rekuc said. That apparently explains deals like the one for a G.E. cordless phone battery sold by an outfit called Sale Stores and shipped by Amazon. The product page offered to knock $829 off the list price, proclaiming ""You save 100 percent."" Some e-commerce experts said nothing needed to be done about illusory discounts, because the merchants needed them so much. The process ""can seem dishonest to consumers, but let's consider the retailer's side,"" said Daniel Green of CamelCamelCamel.com, an oddly named but useful site that tracks Amazon prices. ""If they weren't using the list price as the benchmark, what would they use?"" Retailers could choose the most recent price as the comparison, Mr. Green said, but then ""they would just jack the price way up before the sale. I'm not sure there's a good solution here, particularly as consumers apparently respond to large M.S.R.P.-based discounts."" A few retailers defended themselves in off-the-record conversations by saying there are no victims here. That view got support from a Massachusetts judge in February, who dismissed a case alleging the use of fictitious prices by Kohl's. ""The fact that plaintiff may have been manipulated into purchasing the items because she believed she was getting a bargain does not necessarily mean she suffered economic harm,"" United States District Judge F. Dennis Saylor IV wrote. For others, however, e-commerce is not living up to its promise of being transparent and pro-consumer. ""Ask any consumer: 'Would you like to be manipulated into purchasing anything you would not otherwise buy?'"" said Bonnie Patten, executive director of TruthinAdvertising.org. ""My guess is the answer would be no."" Her site tracks litigation against the retailers. Wayfair, an online furniture retailer, has been sued in a pricing case that is pending. A case against Amazon faltered because its customers waived their rights to sue in favor of arbitration. Perhaps the only real consumer safeguard is to laboriously compare prices. Say, for example, you have plans to tidy up the yard. Worx has a well-regarded combination blower-mulcher. Amazon sells it for $108.39, a 39 percent discount from the list price of $178. Plugging the model into Google, however, yields a range of offers similar to Amazon's retail price. The cheapest, as it happens, was from Worx itself, whose price has recently alternated between $90 and $100. E-commerce is in flux. The selling point is increasingly getting something now rather than getting it cheap. Online shoppers are encouraged to live in an ecosystem where they buy as much as possible from one company. The pioneer of this, of course, is Amazon, with its annual Prime fee that covers shipping. In an ecosystem, prices are much harder to calculate, or perhaps even impossible. Customers have to trust the retailer, a problematic situation. ""Pricing can be complex,"" said Mr. Hariharan of Boomerang Commerce. ""In some places it's highly transparent. But there are others where you have to do the math. You have to check the impact of shipping costs, promotions, coupons and loyalty rewards."" Some consumers feel manipulated. Charlie Allenson, a New Yorker who teaches business skills using improv comedy, was recently shopping for an audio interface that would turn his computer into a recording studio. On one e-commerce site, the list price was $170. At another, it was more. At a third, it was much less. ""I felt like someone was playing three-card monte with me,"" Mr. Allenson said. ""There's a dishonesty factor with all those different list prices."" Even though the final sale price was exactly the same — $100 — he did not buy any of them."
0,2016-04-14,"  (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good morning. Here's what you need to know: • Democratic showdown. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders debate tonight in Brooklyn, just days before the New York primary on Tuesday, for their first meeting in more than a month (9 p.m. Eastern CNN). Here's what to watch for. Their reactions to  five big banks' failing to show ""credible"" plans for dealing with bankruptcy characterize their sharp differences. Mrs. Clinton has criticized calls by Mr. Sanders to break up the ""too big to fail"" banks. At least 20,000 people attended a rally for Mr. Sanders at Washington Square Park in Manhattan on Wednesday night. • #BringBackOurGirls. On the second anniversary of the abduction of 276 Nigerian schoolgirls, the government is scrutinizing a video showing girls identifying themselves as students captured by Boko Haram militants. The footage offers glimmers of hope to their families. The kidnappings led to the social media campaign #BringBackOurGirls, but only about 50 of the girls have managed to escape. • Rebuke for Chicago police. A task force appointed by Mayor Rahm Emanuel has concluded that the Police Department is plagued by systemic racism. It issued 100 recommendations. While blacks make up about one-third of the city's population, 74 percent of the 404 people shot by the Chicago police from 2008 to 2015 were black, the report said, and they were the subjects in 72 percent of the thousands of street stops that did not lead to arrests during the summer of 2014. • On Capitol Hill. Senators have reached a deal to act on a comprehensive energy bill, breaking a three-month partisan standoff over the tainted water scandal in Flint, Mich. Residents of the city are going to extraordinary lengths to find places to shower in lead-free water. While officials say that bathing in the water isn't harmful unless some is ingested, many are skeptical. • The F.B.I.'s early win over encryption. Newly declassified records show how F.B.I. hackers worked to defeat encryption more than 10 years before the agency's recent dispute with Apple over access to a locked iPhone. The agents couldn't decode the data themselves, but they found a clever workaround. • The new $289 Kindle Oasis e-reader from Amazon has a shape meant to mimic a book, and it includes a case with a battery that extends charge time. • What's an online bargain? In Internet ""discounts,"" inconsistent list prices can make it tough to figure out what a product is really worth. • Federal regulators have threatened stiff sanctions against Theranos, the blood-testing company, including closing down its main laboratory. • A.T.M. fraud is surging. Here are some precautions you can take. •  Here are snapshots of the U.S. and global markets. • Saving the best for last. The Golden State Warriors defeated the Memphis Grizzlies for their 73rd win, surpassing the record for most victories in one season, set by the Chicago Bulls 20 years ago. Kobe Bryant scored 60 points in the final game of his career. In the Stanley Cup playoffs, the St. Louis Blues scored in overtime, for a 1-0 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks, the defending champions. The Lightning and Penguins also won. • Medical milestone. A young man who broke his neck playing in the ocean has regained some control over his right hand. Computers connected to a chip implanted in his brain carry electrical signals directly to his lower arm. • Escape artist. Inky, an octopus living in New Zealand's national aquarium, fled through a small gap in his tank cover, crossed a floor and went down a drainpipe to the ocean. The escape happened months ago, but it only recently came to light. • Fresh reads. The new lineup of baseball books include: ""The Arm,"" about the billion-dollar pitching industry, and ""The Selling of the Babe,"" about the trade of Babe Ruth. In ""Game 7, 1986,"" a former starting pitcher writes that drugs were a ""big part of our approach to the game"" as the New York Mets beat the Red Sox in the World Series.

One of the authors is the psychologist whose research formed the basis of the ""10,000-hour rule,"" which holds that it takes about 10,000 hours of practice to achieve mastery in a field. • Recipes of the day. Some vegetarian dishes work for carnivores, especially if the dish is chili. If you're ever looking for a simple side, sautéed spinach never fails. Teachers have been correcting errors in written language from time immemorial, and one colonial American was so bothered by the dismal state of English instruction, he devoted most of his life to improving it. Noah Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language was published on this day in 1828. He was nearly 70 at the time of his crowning achievement. After the American Revolution, Webster was a young teacher in Connecticut, where children learned from British textbooks in one-room schoolhouses. At the time, spelling was plagued by inconsistencies. That bothered him. To start, he eliminated ""u"" from words like ""colour"" and ""honour."" That was a change introduced in what would come to be known as the ""Blue-Backed Speller"" because of its blue cover. It sold hundreds of thousands of copies. For his next project, he hoped to give the U.S. a kind of national independence in language. A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language (1806) further Americanized British spellings, like swapping the order of the ""r"" and ""e"" in ""theatre"" and ""centre."" It also cataloged words in use, but not listed in any dictionary, like ""caucus,"" ""census"" and ""presidential."" An additional 22 years of work produced his 70,000-entry behemoth, including 5,000 words never before included in an English lexicon.

0,2016-04-18," SEATTLE — Amazon is introducing new options to subscribe to its Prime membership service on a monthly basis, a change that could make the company's video service a tougher competitor to Netflix. On Sunday evening, the company notified visitors to its website that it now offers two new Prime price plans, the first of which costs customers $8.99 a month to stream movies and television shows from a new video-only version of its Prime service. A second new plan, priced at $10.99 a month, will provide access to the full benefits of the Prime service, including video streaming, free two-day shipping on Amazon orders, music streaming and other services. Amazon Prime, by most accounts, has been a huge success for the company, but one of the biggest hurdles for anyone thinking about joining the service is that it has required customers to pay $99 up front for an annual membership. The new options do away with the need for an annual commitment to Prime, widening its appeal to people who are more comfortable joining it on a short-term basis. The new monthly options will not save people money, though. Customers who subscribe month-to-month for the full Prime service will pay $32.88 more a year than if they subscribe on an annual basis, while subscribers to the video service will pay $8.88 more a year while getting substantially fewer benefits, like free two-day shipping, than annual Prime members. Amazon began to tinker with the pricing of its Prime service last month, when it introduced a new $10.99 monthly membership option for the full Prime service by allowing customers of Sprint to tack the Amazon service onto their monthly cellular bills. Now, by broadening the monthly options for Prime to anyone and introducing a video-only service, the company is making it easier for people to compare the price of Prime to that of Netflix, the dominant subscription streaming provider, with more than 75 million subscribers globally. Netflix has long been available on a monthly basis, without an annual commitment, offering several plans ranging from $7.99 to $11.99 a month, depending on video quality and the number of screens to which customers can stream video at the same time. Amazon says there are tens of millions of customers for Prime. Piper Jaffray recently estimated there are between 57 million and 61 million Prime subscribers. The company's decision to offer a video-only version of Prime reflects a growing confidence at the company in the quality of the service. Amazon got started in video streaming much later than Netflix, and its catalog of movies and television shows was initially anemic by comparison. For a time, Amazon's video service seemed like little more than a nice additional benefit to the main attraction of the Prime service, two-day free shipping. But Amazon has steadily chipped away at skepticism of its seriousness in video by expanding the amount of content available for streaming. It has nabbed rights to popular series like ""Downton Abbey"" and ""Mr. Robot,"" which are not available to stream on Netflix. Like Netflix, Amazon has poured money into producing original content, including award-winning shows like ""Transparent"" and ""Mozart in the Jungle."""

0,2016-04-21," SEATTLE — Amazon's new urban headquarters — more than 30 office buildings and three towers that, once completed, will dominate a low-slung section of the city — are a gleaming symbol of boom times here. The tech giant has added 20,000 new jobs in Seattle and attracted other tech companies that want to rub elbows. Google plans to expand here as well, with four new buildings and perhaps 4,000 workers. Smaller start-ups dot old brick neighborhoods like Pioneer Square, and newer developments like South Lake Union, where Amazon is building. But the surging growth has also driven up rents and home prices, fueling a homeless crisis so severe that last fall, the mayor declared a state of emergency. And Amazon's focus on its business interests and growth has made it a target of some residents and politicians, who have criticized it as an insular corporate giant uninterested in addressing the problems of its home city. But this week, Amazon stepped into a new place of civic engagement, and raised hopes, city leaders said, of much more to come. The company, in partnership with a nonprofit group called Mary's Place, threw open the doors of an unused building near the heart of its corporate empire, creating one of the largest homeless shelters in Seattle. The 200-bed shelter is taking shape in a former Travelodge that Amazon bought in 2014, a structure that many of the company's employees walk by every day on their way to or from work. The first handful of families who will sleep there started arriving Monday. The solution is temporary. The building will be demolished next year to make way for several more company office buildings. But advocates for the homeless, and Seattle's mayor, Ed Murray, said the real significance of the project, which will be managed by Mary's Place, could not be measured in beds or in the number of months that the shelter will be open. Rather, it is measured in the new relationships that Amazon appears to be forging with the city it calls home. ""New companies struggle to figure out how they can be corporate good neighbors,"" Mr. Murray said in an interview. ""The fact that Amazon has chosen to participate in what is, among West Coast cities, the most difficult and the most controversial issue we face, sends to me a positive signal about what kind of corporate neighbor they could grow into."" ""I think it's a very interesting place for them to take a risk,"" he added. Amazon's director of global real estate and facilities, John Schoettler, said the path to turning the old hotel into a shelter was ""rather serendipitous."" The hotel closed years ago, he said, and the building was being used as college dormitory space when Amazon bought it. But when the mayor declared a state of emergency last fall, Mr. Schoettler said, bells went off. ""We were thinking about different things that we could do with it, and we didn't want it to just sit idle,"" he said. ""So we reached out to the mayor's office."" The area around the shelter is a building maelstrom, with five major commercial office projects and 10 residential developments with 4,657 housing units in planning or construction within a quarter-mile of the property, according to figures from the city. But low-budget hotels still stake out part of the area, too, as do automotive shops. The Elephant Super Car Wash, with its revolving pink sign dating from an earlier era, is only a few blocks away. Support for Amazon's new role has been enthusiastic, especially in the realm of homeless advocacy. ""It's an incredible collaboration,"" said the executive director of Mary's Place, Marty Hartman. She called the company's donation ""huge,"" first because of the offer to make the hotel available earlier this year, and then by refitting it for its new use over the last few months, with such things as a community room and a children's center. Mary's Place will also get $400,000 from the city, from a fund opened up by the mayor's emergency declaration, to help with operating expenses. Ms. Hartman said the new shelter doubled in one day how many people her group can help. A wish list created by Amazon, where online shoppers can donate items to Mary's Place, went up last month as well, tapping into a well of generosity far beyond Amazon's home base. So far, customers have donated items that include 37 room lamps, 49 twin mattresses, 145 boxes of diapers, 26 shower curtains and 1,080 hand and bath towels. Isela Espinoza, 35, a medical assistant and one of the first shelter residents, said the relief it had already begun providing was immediate: She could actually sleep. ""I was sleeping in my car before that,"" she said. And with her two children there with her, ages 12 and 15, she was ever on alert. ""I never felt I could fall asleep because I felt like I needed to protect my children,"" she said. ""It changed my way of thinking about the company,"" she said about Amazon. ""You hardly hear of big companies, making millions and billions of dollars, looking down to see who needs help."" Some economists and politicians said tech companies hadbeen unfairly blamed for negative social and housing effects on cities. Mr. Murray, for one, said the breakdown of government funding for housing and mental health treatment was driving much of the problem here, as well as in rural and suburban areas. A housing expert at the Urban Land Institute, a research group based in Washington, D.C., said growth is always disruptive, and right now, tech is simply the visible engine of that growth in many places. ""Without question, any American city that has seen recent, significant economic growth is grappling with a housing affordability problem,"" said the expert, Stockton Williams, who studies demographics and housing trends for the research group. ""I can't think of a city that is fully meeting the housing needs of all its citizens."" Mr. Schoettler said he hoped Amazon's commitment would extend beyond the one-year life of the shelter. He said that another property nearby could be available next spring, but that it was too soon for promises. ""I can see this going on for several years, but again that's all dependent on our need for space,"" he said."

0,2016-04-25," This is what to expect from the week ahead. OIL INDUSTRY This week is likely to produce evidence of the impact falling oil prices are having on oil-producing countries and businesses. On Monday, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia is expected to reveal his plans for reducing his country's dependence on petroleum, a response to the fall in government revenues. His economic reform proposal may include a partial stock market listing of Saudi Aramco, the national oil company. Several of the world's largest oil companies are also scheduled to report first-quarter earnings, with BP leading off on Tuesday. Exxon Mobil and Chevron, the two largest American oil companies, will follow on Friday. Oil prices that averaged around a third lower for the quarter than they were in the same quarter last year are likely to translate into lower earnings. Stanley Reed TECHNOLOGY Privacy regulators from the United States, Europe and around the globe will gather in Berlin for a two-day conference starting on Monday to discuss how some of the world's largest companies like Google and Facebook use people's digital information. The meeting comes as tension has been mounting over a new trans-Atlantic data-transfer deal that some European regulators say does not give their citizens sufficient protection when information is moved to the United States. Mark Scott  Several of the best-known technology companies — Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Twitter — will report earnings this week. After a disappointing string of earnings reports from Intel, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent of Google, the tech sector could use some good news. Investors will be watching Apple's iPhone business closely to see if the rate at which sales are falling has begun to slow. Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, vowed recently to make bold investments, which could come at the expense of profits. Investors would love to see growth in Twitter's user numbers, while there is wide anticipation that Facebook will continue to show strength as an Internet advertising juggernaut. Nick Wingfield ECONOMY Why is this Federal Reserve meeting less important than most Fed meetings? Because at this Fed meeting, on Tuesday and Wednesday in Washington, the central bank's policy-making committee is unlikely to raise interest rates and is unlikely to say much about its plans for future rate increases. The Fed has already signaled that it isn't planning a second step on the road to higher rates any earlier than June. The Fed will also not update its economic forecasts at this meeting, and the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, will not hold a news conference. Those who closely watch the Fed will parse the post-meeting statement for clues. Everyone else can safely pass over this one. Binyamin Appelbaum BANKING It should be a busy week for earnings reports in Europe as several of the region's biggest banks are expected to share their first-quarter results. Barclays, Deutsche Bank, the British lenders Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group and Banco Santander of Spain are all expected to update investors on their results. The first quarter hasn't been kind to banks this year as uncertainty in the financial markets and problems in the oil and gas industry have weighed on results at the biggest American banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs. Europe's largest lenders haven't been spared the pain of their American counterparts and are expected to report similarly weak numbers. Chad Bray ECONOMY On Thursday, at 8:30 a.m., the Commerce Department will release its initial estimate of economic growth in the first quarter of 2016. Wall Street is looking for a growth rate of 0.6 percent, well below the 1.4 percent annual rate of growth recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. The likely slow pace of expansion comes despite healthy hiring, and if the economy did indeed stumble early this year, it would repeat the pattern of first-quarter deceleration seen in 2014 and 2015. As was the case in those years, most economists expect growth to quicken in the current second quarter. Nelson D. Schwartz  Eurozone finance ministers could meet on Thursday as part of efforts to prevent Greece from returning to the brink of bankruptcy. Though Greece agreed to a third bailout last year, the country must still enact additional reforms to obtain funds to pay back debt that matures in July. A deal is also needed to allow the International Monetary Fund to contribute to the bailout and for the lenders to start negotiations on ways to ease the country's debt burden. There were signs of progress at a meeting late last week in Amsterdam where the eurozone and the I.M.F. agreed to hold Greece to a supplementary set of reforms. JAMES KANTER AUTO INDUSTRY Volkswagen will hold a news conference on Thursday in Wolfsburg, Germany, to provide more details about the record loss it reported on Friday. The carmaker said it lost $6.2 billion after setting aside $18 billion to cover costs stemming from its admission last year that it programmed diesel cars to thwart emissions tests. Jack Ewing MEDIA After battling a glum outlook for the past several months, Viacom has secured a bit of sunshine going into its earnings report on Thursday. The media company announced last week that it had struck a multiyear agreement for Dish to continue to carry Viacom's bundle of TV networks, which include MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central. Viacom stock, which is down about 36 percent in the past year, was up about 14 percent on the news last week. Yet the company still has much to prove to Wall Street. It has reported persistently weak earnings in recent quarters and investors will watch for whether the TV and film company has been able to reverse its fortunes. Wall Street will also be watching earnings reports this week from Charter Communications and Time Warner Cable for an update on their proposed merger. Emily Steel"
0,2016-04-28," Q. Can I save and print highlights from books I use with Kindle for PC (running on Windows 10)? I also read these books on my iPad. A. Thanks to Amazon's e-reader hardware and the apps it makes for other gadgets, its Kindle e-books can be read on numerous devices. The highlights and notes you make in your Kindle books, no matter which screen you have been using, are all synchronized over the Internet — and you can see all those annotations online when you log into your Amazon account. On the Your Highlights page, the highlights and notes you have made in all your Kindle books are listed according to the most recently updated. Here, you can also add, edit or delete notes to your books, copy and paste the text, and print the list from your web browser. (If you are proud of your markup on the book, you can make your highlights and notes visible to other readers by clicking the Your Books link at the top of your personal Kindle page and turning on the checkbox for Public Notes next to the book's title.) Going through Amazon's site is perhaps the most direct way to gather highlights and notes you have made on different Kindle apps, but you can also find several third-party browser extensions and other tools for pulling out and printing your notes. Bookcision and Clippings.io are two of the many Kindle-notes converters around the web. A Clippings.io extension for the Google Chrome browser that imports Kindle notes into the Evernote organizer program is also available for a $3 monthly fee, as is the Kindle to Evernote Chrome extension, which costs $1 a month, for those who do not use Clippings.io. The $5 Print My Kindle Highlights extension is another tool for Chrome users."
1,2016-04-28," SEATTLE — Amazon delivered a blowout quarter on Thursday, joining Facebook as one of the rare bright spots in a technology sector that has recently produced a string of disappointing earnings reports. Helped by its fast-growing Amazon Web Services business, the company jumped to the most profitable quarter in its nearly 22-year history. Amazon often flip-flops between showing profits and losses, depending on how aggressively it decides to plow money into big new business bets. Investors have granted the company much wider leeway to do so than other technology companies of its size often receive, because of its history of delivering outsize growth. For the first quarter, which ended March 31, Amazon reported net income of $513 million, or $1.07 a share, up from a loss of $57 million, or 12 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Revenue at the company rose to $29.13 billion from $22.72 billion a year ago. Amazon's share price jumped more than 12 percent in after-hours trading after the results were released. Investors were happy to see the company show profits after the disappointing run of reports from Apple, Google, Microsoft and Intel. ""The fact that they're profitable is a big deal,"" said Christian Magoon, chief executive of Amplify Investments, a fund manager that counts Amazon as a top holding. ""It's more of a big deal after some of the disappointing numbers from Apple and others."" The results were well above the average estimates of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters for earnings of 58 cents a share and revenue of $27.98 billion. ""I saw the number, and I thought, 'O.K., did I read this wrong?'"" Mr. Magoon added. ""The beat was big. On the income side, it was fantastic."" For the last four quarters, Amazon has run in the black, even if it is still not quite as profitable as some technology companies. Facebook, by contrast, reported that its net income for the first three months of the year tripled to $1.5 billion from a year earlier. The biggest source of the company's profits is Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing business that started just over a decade ago and is now on track to bring in more than $10 billion a year in revenue. A.W.S., as the business is known, is the most popular cloud service for start-ups and for a growing number of big companies that want to rent computing capacity, rather than run their own hardware and software. Cloud computing is also much more profitable than Amazon's North American retail business, which runs on thinner margins, and its international retail business, which runs at a loss. The operating income for A.W.S. more than tripled in the quarter to $604 million. The profits from A.W.S. represented 56 percent of Amazon's total operating income, even though the $2.57 billion in revenue from A.W.S. — up 64 percent from a year earlier — amounted to less than 9 percent of total revenue. On a conference call, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, said the company continued to make hefty long-term investments in initiatives, singling out original content for its Prime video service. In a statement announcing the earnings, Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, highlighted the performance of another growing area of investment — hardware devices — though with the lack of detail that has often characterized Amazon disclosures. He said customers bought twice as many Fire tablets during the first quarter as they did a year earlier, and he said the company could not keep its Echo intelligent speaker in stock. Last year, Amazon reached $100 billion in annual sales. Investors believe that even at that size, the company can become a lot bigger because online commerce still represents a relatively small portion of total retail sales. Online sales in 2016 are expected to reach about $385 billion in the United States, or 8 percent of total retail sales, according to eMarketer, a technology research firm. Amazon is the rare technology company of its size to still deliver double-digit revenue growth. The company's retail sales in North America jumped 27 percent to almost $17 billion for the quarter, while its international retail sales rose 24 percent to $9.57 billion. Amazon said revenue in the current quarter is expected to be between $28 billion and $30.5 billion, with operating income between $375 million and $975 million."
2,2016-04-28," Can Amazon buck the gloomy tech earnings season? For the last week and a half, many tech companies — including Apple and Microsoft — have reported quarterly financial results that have been weaker than expected. Only a few of the giant tech firms have emerged unscathed, with Facebook the prime example. On Wednesday, the social network said it had tripled profit from a year earlier, writes Mike Isaac. Facebook also accompanied the results with a proposal for a third class of shares to cement the control of its founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg. Now it is Amazon's turn. The giant online retailer is scheduled to post earnings on Thursday. Investors are set to examine Amazon's thriving cloud computing business, as well as the company's profit (or lack thereof) as it spends heavily on new initiatives. In a shareholder letter earlier this month, Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, vowed to keep swinging for the fences and to keep inventing. ""Big winners pay for so many experiments,"" Mr. Bezos wrote."
0,2016-04-29," Ten years ago last March, Amazon started the era of renting data storage and computing over the Internet, what is now known as cloud computing. On Thursday, Amazon showed how critical it is to the retailer's future. As Nick Wingfield writes, the Seattle-based Internet retailer reported net income of $513 million, a great showing for a company with thin profit margins that often reports losses. The star of the show was Amazon Web Services, or AWS, that cloud business. Amazon breaks out that sector from the rest of its business, and it makes for impressive reading: Operating income as a percentage of sales for Amazon's retail business was 3 percent; for AWS it was 24 percent. AWS is still a relatively small part of the company's total business, but that outsize profitability is reshaping Amazon. Over all, the company's operating income is 3.6 percent of revenue, but that is up from 1.1 percent a year ago. A big reason is that AWS has doubled its profitability. The effect of new, cloud-based businesses is everywhere in tech this earnings season, from Intel cutting 12,000 jobs as it reorients itself from personal computers to the cloud, to Microsoft reporting lower profits, but investors buying the stock on word of growth in its cloud business, which is similar to AWS. Cloud computing makes a lot of money in part by automating things: A large data center, supplying potentially thousands of customers, may be run by just a half-dozen people. The people engineering these systems have become very clever about running them efficiently too, devising special semiconductors and software. Google and Facebook are also cloud-based companies, though for now they get most of their money from advertising. As we near the end of the tech earnings season, it is useful to look at net income earned per employee at the company. Microsoft had profits of about $32,200 per person in the quarter, a healthy performance considering how many employees it still has in older businesses. It came in just ahead of Goldman Sachs, on a profit per employee basis. Google was twice that, however, at $65,600 per employee. Facebook, which had a great quarter came in tops, at $115,000. There are two more, both largely sellers of retail products to consumers. Apple, which had its first quarter with lower earnings in 13 years, still managed to make $105,000 per person. At the other end of the spectrum was Amazon, earning just $2,092. There are two lessons from that: If you do sell retail products, it helps to sell highly profitable fetish objects, like iPhones — which, not incidentally, have a lot of value because of the cloud-based apps running on them. And if you are selling bargain retail, it's a very good idea to be in the cloud computing business, too."
0,2016-04-30," Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week's news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Farhad: Hello, Mike! I've got to tell you, I'm getting really tired of saying that. We've already chatted on Facebook Live this week. We keep up a regular banter on Slack and Twitter. And then there's this newsletter, week in and week out. You're a nice guy, but … don't you think we're just too involved? Mike: Is this you trying to break up with me? Don't ever leave me, Farhad. I'm too fragile. Farhad: Er, let's just talk about tech news. It was another big week for corporate earnings. Let's summarize: Apple made $10.5 billion in three months, which would be a record for just about any other company on the planet, but for Apple it was an embarrassing comedown from its year-ago peak. Now people are wondering whether Apple's best days are in its past. Hey, whose aren't, am I right? Mike: My mom says my best days are ahead of me. But she also said I was the coolest kid in school which, uh, turned out to be a slight exaggeration. Farhad: Twitter also disappointed investors: The company added some new users, but it fell short of revenue projections, sending people on Twitter into a panic. Amazon, meanwhile, crushed it. The company's sales grew 28 percent, and it posted a profit of $513 million, a record for Amazon. For those keeping score at home: That's about what Apple makes every four days. Amazon's stock went predictably nuts. Mike: Man, what if your job was looking at how much companies' profit margins grew or shrank every day? Just thinking of being surrounded by Excel spreadsheets and punching in figures makes me want to cry. Farhad: While we're on the boring subject of earnings, let's note some recent boardroom shuffles. So Yahoo — remember them? Used to be kind of famous — gave in to one of its fiercest tormentors this week: the hedge fund Starboard Value, often described as an activist investor. Yahoo allowed Starboard to have four seats on its board, a way to ease some tensions in advance of a potential sale of Yahoo's core bus— oh, my God, I'm bored already. Anyway, that's the Yahoo update. Mike: Holy moly, I am bored out of my mind. I need a place to sleep now. Farhad: Funny you should say that! Arianna Huffington, the founder of the Huffington Post and the author of a new book about sleep, has joined the board of Uber. Also, the Huffington Post recently killed a story critical of Uber. Coincidence, I'm sure. Mike: Maybe she can tell me the best way to sleep in an Uber. She's willing to join us on rides, apparently. Farhad: Maybe we should chat about Facebook? Mark Zuckerberg's social behemoth announced huge growth and profits this week, beating out even the most optimistic of analysts' expectations. Zuck also announced his intention to become a kind of world-historic deity, creating a new stock structure that would allow him to give away his money so that he can do things like — I kid you not, this is a real goal, written down on paper and everything — ""cure all diseases by the end of this century."" So you cover Facebook. Tell me, why are they doing so well? More important, can anything stop them? Mike: I think we talked a little bit about this in our Facebook Live discussion this week. (Tune in every week!) It's an important thing to highlight, so let's dive in again. For one, we cannot stress enough just how well Facebook handled the broad consumer shift from using a desktop computer to get to the web to now using smartphones as our gateways to pretty much everything on the Internet. The entire industry was caught off guard by the success of iPhone and Android, and absolutely no one was prepared for how to make money on the phone. That killed — or at least deeply wounded — quite a few successful companies. Remember Zynga? That place was raking in the cash from FarmVille-loving moms on the desktop. Suddenly, everyone is playing Candy Crush Saga on the iPhone and all those cash crops are lying fallow. Zynga still hasn't recovered or found a viable way out. Anyway, Facebook nailed mobile ads in the news feed, and now 82 percent of the company's ad revenue comes from people viewing those ads on smartphones. That's a shift in just a few years, and it's insane. Farhad: It's all the more remarkable considering how unlikely the transition looked a few years ago. Just after the company's I.P.O. in 2012, investors were almost universally convinced that Facebook couldn't get people hooked on its app the way it had seduced us on desktops. And analysts were constantly sounding an alarm that Facebook was just a fad — ""Teenagers Leaving Facebook!"" became an evergreen tech headline — and everyone was constantly on the lookout for the next great social network. Facebook endured, I think, because it understood that its appeal was primal and wasn't dependent on format: People wanted to see what was going on with their friends and frenemies from whatever device they used. Kind of like how you and I can't stop chatting no matter what machine we're on. Mike: Yes, isn't it great? Now, Facebook gets to make all these huge bets on the future to figure out where the next enormous platform for consumers will be and really try to dominate that long before it's backed into a corner and forced to. No one puts Zuck in the corner, ever again. That means huge gambles on acquiring start-ups like Oculus, the virtual reality company, and WhatsApp, the messaging app, for billions upon billions of dollars. I'm nervous to give Facebook too much in the way of props, only because it's already a lovefest with analysts and what goes up must eventually come down. I think Isaac Newton said that. Or Gordon Gekko. Farhad: Yeah, I don't think we should go overboard. Their bets on the future still face huge questions: Can WhatsApp ever make money? Will Facebook Messenger really become a place for commerce and services? Will virtual reality become entrenched in society, or could it end up as the next 3-D TV? And then there's the biggest vulnerability: Will the new Farhad and Mike Facebook Live show convince people to delete Facebook forever? Mike: I've got people unfriending me after that show already — 99 percent of the comments were insults. Anyway, for now, Facebook is still the company to beat. I guess they get to keep taking victory laps. Farhad: Not for long, friend. We're doing another Facebook video next week. That'll show them. See you then!"
0,2016-05-04," SEATTLE — Look outside almost any window at the Guest Rooms homeless shelter here, and the view speaks of wealth and power that the residents inside all lack. Construction cranes claw the sky. Trucks hauling steel or concrete rubble shake the streets. Amazon, the giant online retailer, is building out its headquarters campus in every direction as it and other tech companies, in a scramble for real estate and highly educated talent, reshape the city and its work force. But as tens of thousands of newcomers and longtime residents are finding, the allure of the tech economy comes with big risks and dangers, too, in the rapidly climbing housing and rent prices that have shocked them. The boom has brought with it a crisis of homelessness that the mayor has declared an emergency. ""We knew it was going to be expensive,"" said Mary Delp, who arrived here last month with her partner, J.D. Cox, and her extended family, after a job loss and then an eviction in Las Vegas. They considered and rejected the idea of a move to Texas. Seattle, Ms. Delp said, felt like the place with the rawest, roaring economic boom. But the costs of moving and rent ""were more than we expected,"" she said, ""so we ended up homeless."" They and their two children are settling for now into the Guest Rooms, a former TraveLodge hotel owned by Amazon, which offered it last month to a local nonprofit group called Mary's Place to run as a 200-bed shelter for families. The old hotel is now one of Seattle's largest but most temporary of homeless refuges — doomed to destruction next year as Amazon continues to build. ""We can make it work here,"" Ms. Delp said with crisp resolve, sitting in a brightly painted recreation room, as her children, Krystallynn, 7, and Elijah, 6, played nearby. ""There are job signs everywhere you look out there."" Ms. Delp, 26, is pregnant, due in September. She spoke vividly of the trip north, full of hopes and plans but also pain, in condensing the contents of a three-bedroom house into her father's van and a small U-Haul trailer pulled behind. ""My dad would sleep in the driver's seat, and at first we were sleeping in the middle seat, and the kids had the back. But then it got too uncomfortable for me to sleep, being pregnant sitting up and everything, so we took over the back and the kids would sleep in the middle seat. My dad was still in the front seat. He raised me as a single father, so I've got to make sure he's O.K. He never gave up on me."" Joe Dopp, 39, a former roofer and surgical scrub tech, took his family of five to Seattle this year from a small town on Washington's Pacific coast where second homes and tourism defined the economy, and it was even harder, he said, to earn a decent wage and afford a home. He spoke fast, sitting on a mattress in the family's room, words tumbling out. ""I made $12 an hour. For two years, I didn't get a raise. I asked for one. I was told no, when other people had gotten them. I still don't understand that. I did everything I was supposed to do, but that's one of the main reasons I said, well, if we're out, we can go to Seattle or somewhere else and actually have an opportunity.""  The tech boom, Mr. Dopp said, is clearly making some people very rich, but that does not bother him a bit, because it is also creating construction jobs that he is qualified for and ready to take. ""I never got a job from a poor man in my life,"" he said. ""I don't mind people making their money."" Chelsie Brown, 32, Mr. Dopp's partner, talked about the things left behind. ""When we had an apartment, we could take showers, cook dinner whenever you wanted to, could eat whenever we wanted to, could have groceries in the house, we had furniture, beds to lay in, blankets – we had security, you know. We actually had stuff that we loved."" On the road, it was all so different. ""I did a lot of meal planning: This is what we're having. But when it came down to meats, I would have to get it that day because refrigeration was nonexistent. Anything we had, foodwise, we had to put it in our car."" There were stories of hope and light. Laura Long's son, Gio'moni Caro, 6, has multiple disabilities. He has had five heart operations already. She and her partner, Angel Caro, 34, a former locksmith, have moved repeatedly and left jobs behind to give him the care he needs. They came here so he could be treated at Seattle Children's Hospital, which anchors a corner of the city's biotech corridor and recently expanded its cardiac specialty care. ""It's just been a struggle,"" Ms. Long said. ""As soon as you start climbing the stairs, boom! — another medical issue happens, another hospital stay, another something you can't overcome. That last step that gets us over the top, it just keeps getting knocked back down."" But she said she would change nothing: ""He's one tough cookie. He tells me, 'Mom, it's going to be O.K.'"" Tyrus Gilbertson, 39, came to Seattle last fall to take care of his two children, ages 7 and 14, after their mother vanished. He had been involved in his children's lives, he said, living in a city half an hour north. But the crash course as a single father has pushed him to places he never imagined. ""I was a wrestler in high school, and my coach was always, like, 'Never give up,' so I've always been a fighter, always been. Quitting is not in my vocabulary."" He sat with his palms flat on the table, soft-spoken but resolute in talking about how he has made ends meet. He plans to enroll in a welding course this fall. ""I even panhandled a couple of times. I've always been a shy person so panhandling was like the worst thing in the world for me to do. I hope I'll never have to do that again.""  Joe Dopp and Chelsie Brown said being homeless can't help but make you more empathetic. ""You recognize the things that other people have gone through — you see the world through other people's eyes a little bit,"" Mr. Dopp said. ""Even still, right now,"" Ms. Brown replied, ""you can't judge a book by its cover until you read it. That's what I look at it as. You can't judge people, just because they're sitting in the street."" Mr. Dopp: ""You don't know their story at all."" Ms. Brown: ""No, you don't know their story."" As they spoke, near sunset, the Guest Rooms was quieting for the night — doors closing, common room lights clicking out — sheltering the people within."
0,2016-05-12," Pens matter. Ink does not. In the age of Amazon, evaluating antitrust concerns is sometimes twisting government officials into knots. That was made clear this week, when the Federal Trade Commission blocked the merger of Office Depot and Staples, in part by drawing elaborate distinctions between who buys pens and printer ink cartridges, and how. The products are widely available online, of course, including from Amazon, which by some estimates accounts for half of all online shopping and has reshaped the retail industry. But big companies, the F.T.C. argued, like to shop in bulk, and often don't buy their ink from the same places as people shopping for themselves. For bulk purchases of Post-it Notes and pens, Office Depot and Staples are the primary options. The trade commission's argument underscores just how complicated it has become to judge Amazon's place in the retail industry. To put it simply: The agency does not think that the company benefits all customers equally. The decision also shows how difficult it is for regulators to keep up with industries being reshaped almost daily by technology. ""The impact of online is not uniform,"" said Paul T. Denis, a lawyer at Dechert in Washington, who represented Office Max during its approved merger with Office Depot in 2013. ""Just because it's an effective competitive alternative for individual consumers doesn't mean it's necessarily an effective competitive alternative for other types of customers."" Companies that stock up on pens, Post-it Notes and other items by the thousands have different needs than a college freshman buying a new printer. In the Office Max case, the F.T.C. agreed with Mr. Denis and another partner, James A. Fishkin, that individual customers would still have plenty of low-cost options. But for the decision this week, the agency was not convinced that Amazon was about to offer services that would suit large office supply buyers. Staples and Office Depot are the country's two largest office supply companies, with fleets of trucks, thousands of stores and large geographic footprints. Cutting the two down to one, the agency decided, would hurt those large buyers. ""An online retailer isn't necessarily in that kind of market,"" said Diana L. Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute. As Amazon's history has shown, though, its capabilities can undergo swift and sweeping expansion: A company that started as a bookseller just over 20 years ago now has a business with a stock market valuation of almost $350 billion, dozens of times larger than the combined valuation of Office Depot and Staples. For the two office supply giants, which declined to comment for this article, the future was clear. Amazon has eaten into the profits of traditional retailers for years, and has given every indication that it only intends to grow, including deeper into their business. ""The question becomes, how quickly will they offer that?"" said Daniel S. Bitton, a partner at Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider. Last week, Amazon said its business-to-business website, Amazon Business, generated $1 billion in sales in its first year. Amazon offers same-day delivery in a growing number of stores, and has deep pockets to expand the ventures that it deems successful. Staples and Office Depot argued that Amazon's flurry of new initiatives would make it remain a strong rival, including in the business market. But to win antitrust cases, companies must prove that competitive threats are imminent if not present. The Federal Trade Commission is willing to look into the future, but not too far. ""We look at a very short time horizon because consumers can be injured in the meantime,"" Deborah L. Feinstein, director of the F.T.C.'s Bureau of Competition, said in an interview. Office Depot and Staples, once fierce rivals, saw teaming up as the best way to survive a highly competitive and challenging atmosphere. Consumer spending has lagged in the years since the 2008 financial collapse, and online merchants have increasingly lured away customers from traditional brick-and-mortar stores. Staples closed a combined 242 stores in 2014 and 2015, and expects to shutter another 50 this year, according to the company's most recent annual report. For the year ending Jan. 30, sales fell more than 6 percent, to $21 billion. Office Depot said it had closed 349 stores in 2014 and 2015, and had marked ""at least"" 400 retail stores for closing through 2016. Sales fell 10 percent last year, to $14.5 billion. But evaluating the competitive landscape is about more than store counts and market share, said Ben Gomes-Casseres, a professor at Brandeis International Business School who studies corporate alliances. ""It is basically evaluating the potential, maybe, for that player to expand more rapidly,"" he said. The F.T.C. argued in court documents that Amazon did not have a ""demonstrated track record"" of serving business customers, a segment of the population that many people may not associate with typical antitrust cases. But the commission has blocked mergers that threaten business contracts before, notably with the proposed Sysco and US Foods deal last year. ""We will challenge transactions that have an adverse effect on business customers, not just ordinary consumers,"" Ms. Feinstein said. Including, it might be added, when those shoppers are buying Post-it Notes."
0,2016-05-13," BRASÍLIA — The new Brazilian president's first pick for science minister was a creationist. He chose a soybean tycoon who has deforested large tracts of the Amazon rain forest to be his agriculture minister. And he is the first leader in decades to have no women in his cabinet at all. The government of President Michel Temer — the 75-year-old lawyer who took the helm of Brazil on Thursday after Dilma Rousseff was suspended by the Senate to face an impeachment trial — could cause a significant shift to the political right in Latin America's largest country. ""Temer's government is starting out well,"" Silas Malafaia, a television evangelist and author of best-selling books like ""How to Defeat Satan's Strategies,"" wrote on Twitter. ""He'll be able to sweep away the ideology of pathological leftists,"" Mr. Malafaia added of a conservative lawmaker whom Mr. Temer chose as education minister. For more than a decade, Brazil has been an anchor of leftist politics in the region, less strident than the governments in countries like Venezuela and Cuba, but openly supportive of them and committed to its own platform of reducing inequality. But parts of Latin America are now drifting away from the left after elections in neighboring countries like Argentina and Paraguay. Mr. Temer seems to be embracing a more conservative disposition for his government as well, with the country's business establishment pressuring him to privatize state-controlled companies and cut public spending. To many of Mr. Temer's critics, the shift is perhaps most evident in the role of women in his and Ms. Rousseff's administrations. The contrasts could not be more glaring. Ms. Rousseff, 68, was a former operative in an urban guerrilla group. She was tortured during the military dictatorship and eventually rose to lead the board of the national oil company before becoming Brazil's first female president. Until recently, relatively few Brazilians had even heard of Mr. Temer. When they did, it often involved references to his wife, Marcela Temer, 32, a former beauty pageant contestant who is 43 years younger than he is. They met when she was just 18. A profile of Ms. Temer in Veja, a newsmagazine, caused a stir by glowingly referring to her as ""pretty, demure and of the home."" It said Mr. Temer was ""a lucky man"" to have such a devoted, unassuming housewife as a spouse, especially one who wears knee-level skirts. The magazine did not mention the tattoo on the nape of Ms. Temer's neck featuring her husband's name, but the message was clear: Mr. Temer, a law professor and career politician, embodies a more conservative approach than Ms. Rousseff in the corridors of power and in his own home. Then there is the issue of race. After a long stretch in which Brazil pressed ahead with affirmative action policies, Mr. Temer's critics point out the lack of Afro-Brazilians in his cabinet, especially when nearly 51 percent of Brazilians define themselves as black or mixed race, according to the 2010 census. ""It's embarrassing that most of Temer's cabinet choices are old, white men,"" said Sérgio Praça, a political scientist at Fundação Getulio Vargas, an elite Brazilian university. He drew a contrast with Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, who formed a cabinet in which half of the 30 ministers are women. In a speech to the nation on Thursday, Mr. Temer said he would seek to soothe tensions in Brazil, a nation polarized by the impeachment trial of Ms. Rousseff. She is accused of manipulating the federal budget to hide yawning deficits, a budgetary sleight of hand that her critics say helped her get re-elected in 2014. ""It's urgent to seek the unity of Brazil,"" Mr. Temer said during a ceremony introducing his ministers. ""We urgently need a government of national salvation."" The new president's supporters point out that he considered a couple of women for cabinet-level posts, including Renata Abreu, 34, a lawmaker, to oversee human rights policies. But that effort, along with other test balloons, did not prosper. First, it became widely known that Ms. Abreu had voted in favor of legislation to make it difficult for women who are raped to get abortions. Then Mr. Temer opted to fold the human rights post into the Ministry of Justice, making it a second-tier appointment. Mr. Temer's offer of the science ministry to Marcos Pereira, an evangelical pastor who does not believe in evolution, also fizzled. He named Mr. Pereira trade minister instead. Then, to the dismay of leaders in Brazil's scientific community, Mr. Temer merged the ministries of science and communications. Like many of Brazil's political leaders, Mr. Temer has legal problems of his own. He was recently found guilty of violating campaign finance limits, a conviction that could make him ineligible to run for office for eight years, leaving a cloud of scandal that has raised concerns about his capacity to govern with a strong mandate. ""Temer faces the fundamental problem of legitimacy,"" said Michael Shifter, the president of Inter-American Dialogue, a policy group in Washington. ""He did not become president as a result of a popular vote, but rather because of a controversial impeachment process."" But some argue, in Mr. Temer's favor, that his cabinet includes officials who held important posts when Ms. Rousseff's leftist Workers' Party was in control. Henrique Meirelles, a banker who is the new finance minister, served as central bank president for eight years during the government of Ms. Rousseff's predecessor and mentor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, from 2003 through 2010. During that time, Brazil's government gained the respect of investors as incomes soared during a commodities boom. Prominent figures in Brazil's financial markets hope that Mr. Meirelles can rebuild that credibility. Some environmental activists are blasting Mr. Temer's choice for agriculture minister, Blairo Maggi, a soybean farmer and politician who has pushed for opening huge areas of the Amazon to agricultural development. Yet some point out that Mr. Maggi was also open to dialogue, winning plaudits for reducing deforestation rates while he was governor of Mato Grosso State. Still, Mr. Maggi, along with an array of other members of Mr. Temer's cabinet, has been battling corruption inquiries. For three years, investigators examined claims tying Mr. Maggi to a money-laundering scheme. Just this week, the Supreme Court shelved the case. Other ministers appointed by Mr. Temer remain under investigation in separate cases, including Geddel Vieira Lima, a former executive at one of Brazil's largest government-controlled banks who is now the president's secretary, and Henrique Alves, a tourism minister in Ms. Rousseff's government who will occupy the same post under Mr. Temer. The rancor around the ouster of Ms. Rousseff, who will go on trial in the Senate, was evident Thursday on the streets of Brasília, the capital. Dozens of women chained themselves to barriers surrounding the presidential palace, shouting slogans in support of Ms. Rousseff and expressing alarm about Mr. Temer's top advisers. Maria Hermínia Tavares de Almeida, a political scientist at the University of São Paulo, said that the last time a Brazilian cabinet did not have any women was in the early 1980s, during the military dictatorship that ruled from 1964 to 1985. Until Mr. Temer's rise to power on Thursday, she said, ""all the democratic governments have had women."""

0,2016-05-16," SEATTLE — In early April, Kellen Wadach, the general manager at Amazon's warehouse in Middletown, Del., told hundreds of workers at the cavernous facility a troubling story about his family being abandoned by his father's union. Flashing a photograph of himself as a boy with his father, Mr. Wadach said the union did not help his family financially after his father died suddenly in front of their house, not even bothering to send a condolence card, according to three current workers at the warehouse who heard him speak and asked for anonymity for fear of losing their jobs. The problem with Mr. Wadach's story was that much of it appears to have been untrue. For years, Amazon has successfully battled to keep unions out of the company. And the incident involving Mr. Wadach was an illustration of how important it was to Amazon — or at least to some of its employees — to keep it that way. Just days after a reporter approached Amazon about inconsistencies in Mr. Wadach's story, Scott Stanzel, an Amazon spokesman, said Mr. Wadach was no longer with the company. Mr. Wadach did not respond to repeated messages sent to his email address and Facebook account. A voice mail message left at a listed number for his mother was not returned. In the United States, Amazon employs more than 90,000 people in what the company calls fulfillment centers, giant warehouses where customer orders are prepared and shipped. Some Amazon fulfillment center workers see unions as a way to gain more influence on pay, how job assignments are doled out and the handling of workplace complaints. Amazon worries unions will burden its operations with red tape, hurting the nimbleness of facilities it is constantly adjusting to be more efficient with robots and other innovations. ""Amazon's culture and business model are based on rapid innovation, flexibility and open lines of direct communication between managers and associates,"" Mr. Stanzel said. ""This direct connection is the most effective way to understand and respond to the wants and needs of our associates."" Union officials think Amazon fights so hard to keep them at bay to prevent a domino effect among its warehouses. ""This is Amazon's biggest fear,"" said Andy Powell, a district organizer for the International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers who is trying to organize Amazon fulfillment center workers in Delaware and several nearby states. ""The minute one falls and people see they got a better deal, it's going to be a cancer for them."" Unions have not made much progress at Amazon after years of campaigns, which union officials and warehouse workers blame partly on the high turnover rate in its fulfillment centers. A labor union in Germany has organized frequent strikes over pay and workplace conditions by a portion of workers at Amazon fulfillment centers in the country, though workers do not have a union contract with the company. In 2014, the machinists union helped organize a union vote by a small number of technicians and mechanics who worked on order-fulfillment equipment at the fulfillment center in Middletown, a community of about 19,000 about a half-hour from Wilmington. It was the first vote of its kind at an Amazon warehouse, but workers voted 21 to 6 to reject the plan, which was opposed by Amazon. The company said there were about 3,000 full-time workers at the facility. Since late fall, representatives of the machinists union, including Mr. Powell, have passed out leaflets at a busy intersection outside the fulfillment center. Some employees at the facility have encouraged co-workers to consider the potential benefits of joining a union. In many cases, pay and benefits are not even the top concerns of workers — pay at the Middletown warehouse starts around $13 an hour and health care and parental leave benefits are the same for warehouse workers as they are for senior executives at Amazon. The company said full-time workers at the facility made, on average, over $15 an hour in overall compensation when including base pay, bonuses and stock awards. But workers want things like better protection from termination and mechanisms for contesting favoritism by managers. Mr. Stanzel said the company had a process for employees to appeal terminations and an open-door policy that encourages workers to bring their concerns to managers. Like many other companies, Amazon employs standard ""union avoidance"" techniques, telling workers in gatherings that they will no longer be able to communicate directly with Amazon if a union represents them, union officials said. Around Christmas last year, managers began making the rounds at the Middletown warehouse, questioning workers on their thoughts about unions, said employees at the warehouse. Last June, Scott Gragilla, a former Amazon fulfillment center employee at the warehouse, began asking questions about why workers were not receiving bonuses they had gotten in the past. Not long after, he said, he was reprimanded for his job performance for the first time. Mr. Gragilla, 38, worked as a picker, someone who gathers items from shelves for Amazon orders, and eventually was promoted to ""ambassador,"" an employee who leads training sessions for other employees. He began openly promoting the idea of unionizing the warehouse to co-workers. But in early December, Mr. Gragilla said he was told he was being fired by Amazon for his work performance, including leaving early for his lunch break and failing to return after being ordered back to work by two managers. He denies either is true. Amazon maintains that no employee has ever been terminated as a result of union activity, said Mr. Stanzel, the company spokesman. Mr. Gragilla filed a complaint about his termination with the National Labor Relations Board. He said he was unable to gather enough former co-workers from the Amazon fulfillment center to testify on his behalf, and the board declined to take the case to a judge. Mr. Wadach's emotional story, after those months of union activity, aroused suspicions among employees who were skeptical that a union would act so callously. Word of the story got to the machinists union, which found an obituary in The Ithaca Journal in New York on April 20, 2006, that said Mr. Wadach's father, Peter Dana Wadach, had died while jogging on a family vacation in South Carolina — not in front of the family home, as Mr. Wadach had said. The obituary and another news story said Peter Wadach was a partner at an insurance agency in Ithaca and had worked in the insurance business for nearly three decades. He was 49 when he died. Amazon declined to discuss details of Kellen Wadach's departure from the company. Charlotte Garden, an associate professor of law at the Seattle University School of Law, said Mr. Wadach's story, odd as it may have been, would probably not reach a legal threshold for ""coercive"" behavior. ""That's a pretty high bar,"" she said. ""That means a lot of employer persuader activity is lawful."""
1,2016-05-16," This is what to expect in the week ahead: FINANCIAL Argentina will issue its first major corporate bonds in international markets since it resolved a lengthy debt feud with hedge funds and came out of default. Banco Hipotecario, a commercial bank and mortgage lender, will issue up to $200 million worth, Manuel Herrera, the assistant chief executive, said in an interview. The order book for the bonds, maturing in 2020, will open on Monday or Tuesday. Under its new president, Mauricio Macri, Argentina returned to global credit markets last month after a 15-year hiatus. Its sale of $16.5 billion in bonds — the biggest ever in so-called emerging markets — was priced at an average of 7.14 percent, demonstrating investors' appetite for high yields despite risk. Banco Hipotecario did sell bonds last year while Argentina was still in default. They were issued at 9.75 percent, but this time pricing could tighten to less than 8 percent, market analysts said. ""The demand is very high for Argentina,"" Mr. Herrera said. ""Everyone is trying to tap this opportunity."" Jonathan Gilbert ECONOMY On Tuesday, economists will get a host of new data on how the economy performed last month. The Commerce Department will report on housing starts in April, with experts looking for a slight pickup in activity that would lift the annual rate of new construction to 1.1 million units. Housing starts fell 8.8 percent in March to the lowest level since October 2015. The data for April should help indicate whether that was a blip or a sign of softness ahead in residential construction. The Labor Department will release data on inflation in April. The Consumer Price Index is thought to have increased by 0.2 percentage point in April while the core C.P.I., which does not include more volatile food and energy prices, is estimated to have risen 0.1 percent. The increase in the broader index was driven by higher gasoline costs in particular, but inflation remains tame, according to economists. Also on Tuesday, the Federal Reserve will release data on industrial production and capacity utilization in April. The Fed expects a modest improvement in both measures, with industrial production rising by 0.1 percentage point and capacity utilization increasing slightly to 74.9 percent. Both have been anemic lately, hurt by the slide in energy-related activity and weak demand from overseas because of the stronger dollar. But factory activity may have rebounded slightly in April. Nelson D. Schwartz  Japan's economy probably grew by the thinnest of margins in the first quarter of the year. The country will report gross domestic product numbers on Wednesday, and economists' latest estimates point to annualized growth of 0.2 percent. Anemic consumer spending, a tumbling stock market and the fallout from China's slowdown all stood in the way of faster expansion, experts say. The economy contracted by 1.1 percent in the final quarter of 2015, and might have shrunk by a similar amount in the first quarter of 2016 if not for the extra day provided by the leap year. Jonathan Soble  The Federal Reserve's April meeting passed quietly, with no increase in the Fed's benchmark rate and no clear signal that another rate increase was imminent. The minutes of that meeting, which the Fed will publish on Wednesday, may help to explain the Fed's caution. Job growth remains fairly strong, while reported economic growth has been weaker than expected. Some Fed officials have said since the meeting that they have not ruled out raising rates at the Federal Reserve's next meeting in June. Investors, however, are increasingly convinced that the Fed will wait for more data to clarify the divergence, and that the central bank is not likely to raise rates before September. Binyamin Appelbaum Finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of 7 leading industrialized nations are scheduled to meet in Sendai, Japan, on Friday and Saturday. They are expected to discuss a broad range of global risks, from swings in oil prices and currencies to the slowdown in China. A core issue will be whether countries can continue to rely on their central banks to stimulate growth, or whether governments need to play a bigger role by increasing spending or cutting taxes. The talks are a precursor to the Group of 7 leaders summit meeting in Japan on May 26 and 27. Jonathan Soble RETAILING Walmart, the country's largest retailer, will report first-quarter earnings on Thursday. Analysts will pay particular attention to the shopping giant's e-commerce business, in which it has invested heavily to better compete with Amazon. Amazon has also posed a challenge for another low-cost rival, Target, which will release its first-quarter results on Wednesday. Rachel Abrams"
0,2016-05-17," SAN FRANCISCO — Google will introduce its much-anticipated entry into the voice-activated home device market on Wednesday, according to people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Named Google Home, the device is a virtual agent that answers simple questions and carries out basic tasks. It is to be announced at Google's annual developers' conference in Silicon Valley. Google Home will come to market in the fall — a long time away, given the speed of technology, but Google needed to plant a stake in the ground now. The device will compete with Amazon's Echo, which was introduced less than two years ago. Amazon has already sold an estimated three million units. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment. Virtual agents powered by artificial intelligence are one of the major new battlegrounds for consumer technology. Apple's Siri, released in October 2011, drew widespread attention but it was the Echo that, after mixed initial reviews, has become a genuine consumer application. Among the recent features added to Alexa, as the Echo's software brain is called, are the ability to summon a car from Uber, order pizza from Domino's and get fitness information from Fitbit and election news from NBC. ""Amazon, Facebook, Apple and others are all heading towards the virtual agent,"" said Julie A. Ask, an analyst with Forrester Research. ""Google has seemingly let the competition catch up — level the playing field, even. It's all the more critical that they do well here, given earlier misses on instant messaging and social media."" Some elements of the Google product were reported earlier by the technology news sites Recode and The Information. Virtual agents are a work in progress. Questions are already arising about privacy, disclosures and the quality of the information being doled out. The more information a company has about your habits, interests, purchases and opinions, the better its agent can serve you. ""We're making everything contextually aware,"" Sundar Pichai, then the head of Google's Android phone software program, said at the 2014 developers' conference. ""We want to know when you're at home, with your kids."" Mr. Pichai is now chief executive of Google and will deliver this year's keynote address to developers."

0,2016-05-18," MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — The battle for control of the living room just began in earnest. Also, the bedroom, dining room and — it's a safe bet — the bathroom as well. Google, which knows more things about more people than any other company, organization or government in history, announced on Wednesday a new household device that will use that information to help people run their lives. It's called Google Home, and it is not much bigger than a grapefruit. It has no buttons but is activated by voice. It is the most important new venture by the search company, which is repositioning itself as less a tool you go to and more an assistant that is sometimes visible but always present. ""We want users to have an ongoing two-way dialogue with Google,"" Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, told about 7,000 attendees in an outdoor music amphitheater here in the Internet company's hometown. ""We have started becoming truly conversational."" Google Home got top billing during the two-hour keynote by Mr. Pichai and other executives at the company's annual developer conference, but many details — how much it will cost, when it will be available — were not disclosed. The device existed on the stage, but its features still seemed to be works in progress. Why introduce it now and make such a big thing of it? The reason seemed to lie in Mr. Pichai's unusual shout-out to a competitor. ""Credit to the team at Amazon for creating a lot of excitement in this space,"" he said. Excitement, and sales. In less than two years, Amazon has sold millions of  Echo devices for as much as $180. (The retailer does not disclose sales figures, but it is clear the device is a serious hit.) And each of the voice-activated home virtual assistants that it sells plunges the owner deeper into the company's ecosystem, where he or she orders groceries and watches movies from Amazon. Those are millions of consumers who are lost, at least to some extent, to Google. The search company had to begin competing with Amazon before that number swelled to tens of millions. Mr. Pichai pointedly noted that Google was ""at a pivotal moment."" This was Google's 10th annual developers conference, but the first held in the amphitheater adjacent to its headquarters. The event is designed to be mostly instructive and inspirational for the freelance software engineers who use Google's tools to build things. But it is also promotional, an opportunity taken to broadcast around the world — there were a million people listening in China, Mr. Pichai said — what tomorrow will hold. The mood was rock star, the weather toasty, the future full of machines that would anticipate your every mood and need. Google has at times been the world's most valuable public company — Apple is often No. 1 at others — but it cannot take anything for granted. Mario Queiroz, the Google executive in charge of Home, said it would ""be a beautiful addition to any room in your house."" In a short film, a family was shown waking up with Home. The father used it to play music in one child's room and to turn on the lights in another to get them out of bed. The girl, finishing her homework, asked Home what the Spanish word was for ""apple."" The parents rearranged their schedules. ""It will let anyone in the family, kids or adults, have a conversation with Google,"" Mr. Queiroz said. Indeed, in the film, everyone is so busy communicating with Home they hardly talk to each other. Google already does search solely through voice, but its efforts have been confusingly branded. On Wednesday, Google promoted Google assistant — the company's name for the ability to have a two-way conversation to get information. It will be available this summer in a messaging app called Allo and later in Google Home. There have been efforts before to develop control centers for the home, but none have made serious inroads. Even the Echo was not an immediate hit with reviewers, some of whom wondered whether it might be little more than a gimmick. ""Before I got an Echo I thought it was a joke and a bad idea,"" said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray. ""But I saw the utility and ended up buying five of them for my family."" For Google Home to stand out, he said, it would have to outdo the Echo, particularly in search. ""You have to be able to ask it a complex question, and then it would go to the Internet and read it back to you,"" Mr. Munster said. ""Echo doesn't do a good job of that today."" Search is, of course, the foundation of Google's success, but Amazon will do what it can to protect its lead. Microsoft, Apple and Facebook are also employing artificial intelligence to enhance their products and services, which is one reason this will be a battle waged on many fronts. The big tech companies are the new middlemen of commerce and communication. People used to go to stores to buy brands on impulse or by design. Now Google, Amazon and the others mediate the moment. ""A handful of big companies will dominate mobile moments and create distance between brands and their consumers,"" said Julie A. Ask, an analyst with Forrester Research. ""Virtual agents will hold a lot of power."" One example of that power was given by Mr. Pichai, when he demonstrated a conversation with Google through his phone about taking his family to the movie ""Jungle Book."" ""Is 'Jungle Book' any good?"" he asked. The reply came: ""Looks like it's getting some good reviews."" Who or what is powering the agent's opinions, and how much the consumer can trust it, are among many things still to be worked out."
1,2016-05-18," MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — Google on Wednesday introduced Google Home, a voice-controlled, Internet-connected speaker that competes directly with Amazon's smart speaker, Echo, which costs $180. The company also introduced Allo, a messaging app, and a rebranding of its virtual assistant. Here's a quick explanation of what these major announcements, made at the Google I/O developer conference, mean for consumers. What do Home and Echo have in common? Home and Echo are both speakers that require a wired power connection. They stream music and perform tasks like web searches, adding calendar appointments and looking up movie showtimes over an Internet connection. What are the differences between Google Home and Amazon Echo? Google has yet to share many important details, including a price tag, about Google Home, which is scheduled for release this fall. However, from the announcement we can glean a few differences: Home, which can easily be held in one hand, is shorter and more compact than Echo. Both speakers have a cylindrical shape, but the top of Home is slanted downward, whereas Echo's top is flat. Google is allowing consumers to choose from different colors for the bottom part of Home, while Echo comes only in black. (Amazon also sells a smaller voice-controlled speaker called Tap.) Most important, the brains of Home will be Google's virtual assistant, which draws from Google's extensive search database, whereas Echo relies on Alexa, Amazon's assistant. In other words, consumers can expect voice commands that already work with Google's assistant to work with Google Home. In a recent test comparing virtual assistants from Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft, Google's assistant was the most capable of performing basic tasks, largely because it drew data from Google's search engine. Is Home smarter than Echo? Thanks to Home's reliance on Google's search engine, it will probably be a smarter speaker than the Echo when it comes to basic tasks like web searches and looking up traffic data. However, when it comes to actions offered by outside companies — like the ability to order a pizza from a restaurant or to set your Internet-connected thermostat — Home's success will depend largely on whether Google persuades third-party developers to create tasks that work with it. ""To do this well we really need to work with developers and third parties so we can provide these actions to our users,"" said Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, during his announcement of Home. By contrast, Amazon has already made great progress with third-party developers for Echo. Alexa is capable of summoning an Uber car, ordering a pizza from Domino's, controlling smart light bulbs and much more. Time will tell which company's speaker gets more third-party support, but Echo, which was released last June, has a major head start. What is Google's assistant? Here's where things get confusing. Google is referring to the virtual-assistant portion of its search product as ""assistant."" Previously it was called Google Now, and later it was renamed to just Google. The problem was that many consumers had trouble distinguishing Google search from its virtual assistant because the assistant lacked a friendly name like Siri or Alexa. The difference now, Google says, is that its assistant is more capable of being naturally conversational than other assistants. Adding to the confusion: Google's assistant is what comes with Google Home and Allo, the new messaging app. But you won't summon it by saying ""Google assistant."" You'll just say ""Google."" What is Allo? Allo is Google's forthcoming messaging app, which has Google's assistant built into it. Inside the app, you will be able to type ""@google"" and say conversational things like ""Let's go out for some Italian food."" Google will then respond with some suggestions for tables to reserve at Italian restaurants using, for example, the OpenTable app. What's more, you will be able to have conversations with friends and type ""@google"" with questions or requests inside those conversations; all people in the conversation will see how Google's assistant responds. The Allo app will be released this summer for iPhones and Android phones."
0,2016-05-19," For six seasons, Julian Fellowes's ""Downton Abbey"" was shown in the United States as part of PBS's ""Masterpiece,"" which meant that its episodes were introduced by the American actress Laura Linney. Mr. Fellowes's new examination of British pride and impropriety, ""Julian Fellowes Presents Doctor Thorne,"" will stream on Amazon Prime (the four episodes are available Friday), where it has a host who's more in the classic vein: Mr. Fellowes, doing his best Alistair Cooke impression. Amazon clearly added the short introductions (they weren't part of the original ITV broadcasts in Britain) to capitalize on Americans' ""Downton""-inspired fondness for Mr. Fellowes. But it turns out that he's a natural. Sitting on a book-lined set, wearing a pinstriped chocolate-brown suit and with a slightly unsettling gleam in his eye, explaining his Victorian-era mini-series to us Yanks, he's like a jovial uncle from the early stages of a Pinter play. If Ms. Linney moves on, her successor is in sight. Mr. Fellowes adapted ""Doctor Thorne"" (which was directed by Niall MacCormick) from an 1858 novel by Anthony Trollope, the third in his Barchester series. Trollope remains largely unknown in America, which Mr. Fellowes notes regretfully. But ""Doctor Thorne"" will feel familiar to fans of Trollope's more famous near-contemporary, Jane Austen. It's about a smart, unmarriageable young woman and the various scenarios that could eventually render her marriageable. The story begins with the accidental death of a man named Thorne in a drunken brawl in 1836, then jumps ahead 20 years. At first it's confusing to see a living Dr. Thorne, but Mr. Fellowes's lucid, nimble screenplay quickly acquaints us with the main figures and the social strata of the fictional town of Barchester. Dr. Thorne, played with circumspect grace by Tom Hollander (""The Night Manager""), is respected but subordinate, tending to both the medical and financial affairs of a local baronet (Ian McShane), who affectionately bullies him. Dr. Thorne has a niece, Mary (Stefanie Martini), whose kindness and high spirits are outweighed, in the marriage market, by the shady and mysterious circumstances of her birth. This is the engine of the plot, as her chances with men of varying suitability rise and fall, and other young women in search of husbands keep a wary eye on her progress. Mr. Fellowes emphasizes Trollope's humor without shortchanging the melodrama, and the production has the feeling of a high-def tribute to an earlier era of British film and television (emphasized by the use of old-fashioned fonts for the credits) — it achieves a kind of rollicking serenity. ""Doctor Thorne"" is a minor canvas, compared with ""Downton Abbey,"" but Mr. Fellowes packs a lot of charm and amusement into its 160 minutes. ""There's rather a lot going on, isn't there?"" he says before one episode, giving himself a well-deserved pat on the back."
0,2016-05-26," Matt Bomer, Kelsey Grammer, Lauren Ambrose, David Krumholtz, Jessica Paré, David Arquette and Zoë Kravitz will be among the stars included in the latest slate of Amazon pilots, debuting on June 17. The company announced eight new shows on Thursday, including six for children, that it will consider turning into series for its streaming service, based in part on viewer feedback. The pilots are available for the public to watch at Amazon.com, typically for around 30 days, with any resulting series available only to the company's Prime subscribers. The Emmy-winning ""Transparent"" and Golden Globe-winning ""Mozart in the Jungle"" each began as Amazon pilots, as did ""The Man in the High Castle,"" the Amazon original series most streamed by Prime members globally. ""The Interestings,"" adapted from the Meg Wolitzer best seller, follows a group of artistic teenagers from summer camp in 1974 through several decades of adulthood. Ms. Ambrose stars as an actress who uses her wit to compensate for what she's lacking in glamour, money and talent. Mike Newell (""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"" ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"") directed the pilot, which also features Mr. Krumholtz and Ms. Paré. ""The Last Tycoon,"" written and directed by Billy Ray, the Oscar-nominated screenwriter of ""Captain Phillips,"" was adapted from the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel about a Hollywood golden boy (Mr. Bomer) battling his boss and father figure (Mr. Grammer) for the soul of a film studio during the Depression. Four pilots are aimed at children ages 6 to 11, including ""Sigmund and the Sea Monsters,"" a live-action show based on Sid and Marty Krofft's 1970s Saturday-morning series about two brothers who befriend a sea monster. Mr. Arquette plays Sigmund's biggest threat, the hunter Captain Barnabas. ""Little Big Awesome,"" animated by the studio Titmouse (""Motor City,"" ""Metalocalypse""), follows two friends through a world where sea turtles fly and flowers talk. ""Morris and the Cow,"" about a 10-year-old determined to become a cowboy, features the voices of Jermaine Fowler (""CollegeHumor"") and Ms. Kravitz (""Divergent""). In ""Toasty Tales,"" written by Merriwether Williams, a ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" alum, three best friends happen to be marshmallows. Two pilots are intended for preschoolers: ""The Curious Kitty and Friends,"" about Komaneko, a cat who explores with video camera and knapsack in tow, and ""Jazz Duck,"" about a duck who sounds like a saxophone."
1,2016-05-26," Amazon Web Services, the biggest of the cloud-computing providers, has a new line of work: Taking other cloud-computing giants into other countries. On Wednesday, Salesforce.com announced it would use A.W.S. to expand in Canada and Australia, in a deal valued at about $400 million. If successful, the value of the transaction will most likely get much bigger. ""For sure, we're talking of billions of dollars in services over the next several years,"" said Marc Benioff, the co-founder and chief executive of Salesforce. Salesforce already uses A.W.S. for some of its businesses, but this is the first time its key applications will be on someone else's computers. Mr. Benioff said Salesforce had evaluated similar deals with Microsoft and Google, the other two giants in selling cloud-computing to corporations. So far, A.W.S. is still ahead on its range of offerings and low prices, he said. Salesforce will review the contract in one year, he added. Cloud computing uses a massive density of computer servers and sophisticated software to rent data storage, computing and applications to companies. Besides those capabilities, the deal with A.W.S. enables Salesforce to get into new markets faster, since Salesforce doesn't have to find facilities and recruit talent. Amazon has also established itself in countries like China that have strict requirements about what data can be sent offshore. Meeting those regulations is difficult and time-consuming, and companies like Salesforce put a premium on getting into markets quickly. While the deal could be a sign of larger trends in corporate computing, as businesses evaluate whether to keep their own computers or work with the big public clouds, for now it also has limits. That spending will probably be limited to new countries where Salesforce expands, Mr. Benioff said. That may change, he added, as the three giants bring down prices and increase the services they offer. ""We have our own infrastructure in the U.S., Japan, the U.K., France and Germany,"" Mr. Benioff said. ""If you have critical mass, your own infrastructure is still cheaper."" Mr. Benioff said that, down the line, A.W.S. may also become competitive purely on price, as their scale and engineering enables them to run big computing systems at a lower cost. ""If Amazon, Microsoft and Google are smart, the price difference will change,"" he said. Adam Selipsky, vice president of marketing and sales for A.W.S., said the company was intent on getting its prices down enough to replace existing servers in established markets. ""Our prices relative to what they can build themselves – we're already at a stage where it's competitive,"" he said. ""We're just at the starting point of enterprise adoption."""
2,2016-05-26," The Amazon gladiator frog is a fighter. But it could become a ghost. Extinction threatens 40 percent of amphibian species worldwide, and they are vanishing at alarming rates. This March, Robin Moore, a photographer and the communications director for the organization Global Wildlife Conservation , traveled to Panama to search for a single photo that would convey the gravity of the global extinction crisis threatening frogs, toads and other amphibians. After eight days of waiting for the right frog, at the right place and the right time, he captured that picture, which he titled, ""The Vanishing."" Its single long exposure was designed to give the frog a ghostly appearance and communicate that amphibians are disappearing forever around the world. Since 1980, more than 200 amphibian species have disappeared from the planet as a result of habitat loss, killer fungi, viruses, pollution, and the exacerbation of these threats from climate change. But in recent years some amphibian species that were thought to be lost have in a sense, emerged from the dead, leading scientists to study how they escaped extinction. In 2010, Mr. Moore and his colleagues created a Top 10 Most Wanted poster for lost frogs and launched ""The Search for Lost Frogs,"" a campaign that took 100 scientists across 19 countries to find these Lazarus frogs. Its success led to a book, ""In Search of Lost Frogs,"" published in 2014. Since then, the journey has continued and conservationists are working to establish ecotourism and nature reserves to protect the vital habitats where the lost frogs are found. These are some of the stories behind Mr. Moore's quest to elevate these big-eyed species to the level of more charismatic species — like the ones ""with eyelashes,"" as he puts it. After this toad made Mr. Moore's Top 10 Most Wanted list in 2010, it took scientists eight months to find it in Malaysia's rain forest. They only had a scientific illustration of the toad, and didn't even know its color. But two researchers, Indraneil Das and Pui Yong Min, finally found it in 2011 at an elevation nearly 1,000 feet higher than its last sighting in 1914. The poster child of lost frogs is the Variable Harlequin, which was rediscovered in Costa Rica in 2003 after chytrid fungus was thought to have decimated the population. By figuring out what allowed them to survive this plague, scientists hope the species will hold clues for solving the amphibian crisis. This frog only lives in two populations within about 100 yards of one another along one stream in a remote private reserve in Costa Rica. Mr. Moore reached out to dozens of herpetologists who could not or would not reveal the frog's ultra specific location. ""Trying to find someone who could tell me where this was, was like trying to get into Fort Knox,"" he said. When he finally found a guide, there were no signs of the frog and humidity had disabled his camera. He was lucky that it started working again just at the moment he spotted the Variable Harlequin on a rock. The Long-limbed Salamander was rediscovered in an area of a low-lying cloud forest in Guatemala in 2014, 40 years after it had last been seen. To get this shot, Mr. Moore traveled with two biologists, Paul Elias and Jeremy Jackson, retracing their footsteps by using their original 1970s field notes from when they first found the salamanders. Last year, international and local conservation groups established a new amphibian reserve for the rediscovered salamanders. Mr. Moore had no luck finding the Mesopotamia beaked toad (Rhinella rostrata), last seen in 1914 in the Choco forests of Colombia. But in the process, he stumbled upon this potentially new species of beaked toad. In 2010, this toad was named one of Time Magazine's top new species, and its comparison to Monty Burns, Homer's boss on ""The Simpsons,"" brought it much attention."
0,2016-06-01," RANCHO PALOS VERDES, Calif. — Jeff Bezos built Amazon into an e-commerce and computing powerhouse. Now his ambitions are more sprawling as he takes on ever larger civic and business challenges. Those diverse interests were on display on Tuesday when Mr. Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, spoke onstage at the Code technology conference here, where he commented on an array of topics, including workplace culture, privacy and his decision to buy The Washington Post in 2013. Mr. Bezos said he bought the newspaper because he wanted to make it into a more powerful national — and even global — publication, and that The Post was well situated to be a watchdog over the leaders of the world's most powerful country. ""If it had been a financially upside-down salty snack food company, I would not have bought it,"" he said. The Amazon chief also addressed an investigation last summer by The New York Times that found the company had a tough workplace culture. Mr. Bezos said the article had not made him rethink how Amazon treated employees and that the company was ""the gold standard for pioneering work."" He also commented on the tension between privacy and national security, calling it ""the issue of our age"" and noting that Amazon had filed a court brief supporting Apple during its recent battle with the Federal Bureau of Investigation over an iPhone used by one of the attackers in a shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., last December. Mr. Bezos' comments come at a time when he and Amazon are riding on new highs. After a rough patch in which Amazon's sales fell short of expectations and new products like the Fire Phone flopped, the company is flourishing. A bet Mr. Bezos placed on cloud services more than a decade ago has blossomed into a $10-billion-a-year business, leading Amazon to the biggest profit in its history in the first quarter of 2016. The Echo, Amazon's smart speaker, has earned raves from technology reviewers and customers. Mr. Bezos' personal profile has also soared with his acquisition of The Post. Under his ownership, the newspaper's online audience has grown. The Post reported 30 percent year-over-year growth in unique digital visitors in April. A couple of weeks ago, Mr. Bezos traded shots with the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, who accused Mr. Bezos of dodging corporate taxes and abusing his position as owner of The Post to launch personal attacks and to keep lawmakers from scrutinizing Amazon. Mr. Bezos said at the time that Mr. Trump's unsubstantiated statements were ""not an appropriate way for a presidential candidate to behave"" and that he welcomed scrutiny and criticism of Amazon. On Tuesday, Mr. Bezos reiterated it was ""not appropriate"" for Mr. Trump to ""freeze or chill the media that are examining him."" ""It's just a fact that we live in a world where half the population of this planet, if you criticize the leader, you'll go to jail or worse,"" Mr. Bezos said. ""We live in this amazing democracy with amazing freedom of speech, and a presidential candidate should embrace that."" Mr. Bezos also predicted that global population growth and energy demand would increase pressure to make space more accessible. He owns a space exploration start-up called Blue Origin. He predicted that heavy industry would move off the planet and ""earth will be zoned residential and light industrial."""
0,2016-06-02," When Aaron Vincent Elkaim reached the Xingu River basin in Brazilâs Amazon rain forest in 2014, he found a lush and humid green expanse that made him feel as if he were infinitesimally small, living âinside a single giant organism.â The region is one of the worldâs most biologically and ethnically diverse areas, home to about 25,000 indigenous people, many of whom live as their ancestors did in close relationship to the land. âIt was eye-opening to see what it's like to live in a mostly preindustrial world where people live off of the environment and are mostly content with work, family and a traditional identity connected to the land,â he said  It is a way of life under threat. The Belo Monte dam, under construction on the Xingu, will soon be the third-largest hydroelectric complex in the world in terms of output. When completed, it will provide energy for Brazilâs urban boom and fuel further industrialization of the Amazon basin. The Belo Monte is just one of scores of dams that the government has planned for the rivers of the Amazon rain forest to propel the growth of Brazilâs economy. Although plans for the Belo Monte hydroelectric complex started in 1975, construction was delayed until 2011 because of fierce and persistent protests by several of the regionâs 16 indigenous tribes. The original project was changed so that tribal lands would not be directly flooded. But nearby forests where they hunted would be submerged, and the dam will most likely affect water levels and drinkability, transportation and fishing.  Many Brazilians whose family roots in the area date to a century ago, when it had a booming rubber industry, are also affected. They mostly live off the land and still depend on fishing and tapping their own rubber trees.  The story of the dam and its effects on the environment result in the kind of slow, subtle photo essay that is expensive to do and hard to fund. Mr. Elkaim recently received a $20,000 Alexia Foundation grant, which will enable him to pursue the story for the next year. His rain forest images will be displayed at the Look3 Photo Festival in Charlottesvile, Va., from June 13 to 19 as a part of an exhibit celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Alexia Foundation. Curated by Mike Davis, the exhibit will also include Mary Calvertâs work on homeless female veterans who have survived sexual trauma in the military.   Look3 began as an annual backyard party of photographers started by Michael Nichols, known as Nick, in 1988 in Berkeley, Calif. By 2005, he had 500 people at his home in Charlottesville. Look3 became a full-blown festival in 2007. This yearâs exhibits also include work by Nick Brandt, Graciela Iturbide, Yuri Kozyrev and Frans Lanting as well as Olivia Bee, Sheila Pree Bright, Binh Danh and Radcliffe Roye, known as Ruddy. The festival also includes two daylong seminars for  emerging and midcareer photographers. Mr. Elkaim is based in Toronto and is a founding member of the Boreal photo collective. His previous project, âSleeping With the Devil,â on the Fort McKay First Nation people, whose fate has become tied to the Athabasca oil sands, was published on Lens in 2012. It explored what is lost, and what is gained, when traditional cultures embrace modern materialism.  Even before the Belo Monte dam project, the surrounding area had been severely damaged by the clearing of forests by outsiders for cattle grazing. While the tribal protests helped change the original plan for the hydroelectric complex, a new dam is planned nearby on the TapajÃ³s River. Mr. Elkaim recently spent time there with the Munduruku tribe, who are fighting to stop that dam. They have recently delayed construction by getting their territory officially recognized by the government as indigenous land.  When Mr. Elkaim returned to the area around the Belo Monte hydroelectric complex earlier this year, even those people still protesting seemed resigned to the damâs impending effects on their environment and way of life.  While this story may be too nuanced â and remote â to inspire headlines in North America, Mr. Elkaim says he thinks it is critical because it is typical of what he sees as the âguttingâ of ecosystems around the world. âWe have to protect the people whose entire way of life, identity and culture are dependent upon these ecosystems,â he said. âIf we protect their way of life, they will protect the environment around them.â James Estrin, the co-editor of Lens, will be participating in the educational programs on June 15 at the Look3 festival.

0,2016-06-06," Your smartphone allows you to get almost instantaneous answers to the most obscure questions. It also allows you to waste hours scrolling through Facebook or looking for the latest deals on Amazon. More powerful computing systems can predict the weather better than any meteorologist or beat human champions in complex board games like chess. But for several years, economists have asked why all that technical wizardry seems to be having so little impact on the economy. The issue surfaced again recently, when the government reported disappointingly slow growth and continuing stagnation in productivity. The rate of productivity growth from 2011 to 2015 was the slowest since the five-year period ending in 1982. One place to look at this disconnect is in the doctor's office. Dr. Peter Sutherland, a family physician in Tennessee, made the shift to computerized patient records from paper in the last few years. There are benefits to using electronic health records, Dr. Sutherland says, but grappling with the software and new reporting requirements has slowed him down. He sees fewer patients, and his income has slipped. ""I'm working harder and getting a little less,"" he said. The productivity puzzle has given rise to a number of explanations in recent years — and divided economists into technology pessimists and optimists. The most prominent pessimist is Robert J. Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University. His latest entry in the debate is his new book, ""The Rise and Fall of American Growth."" Mr. Gordon contends that the current crop of digital innovations does not yield the big economic gains of breakthrough inventions of the past, like electricity, cars, planes and antibiotics. The optimists are led by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, co-directors of the M.I.T. Initiative on the Digital Economy. They argue that there have always been lags between when technology arrives and when people and institutions learn to use it effectively. That has been true for a range of technologies, including the electric motor and the internet, which contributed to the last stretch of healthy productivity growth in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The gains from current tech trends like big-data analysis, artificial intelligence and robotics, they say, will come. Just wait. Some economists insist the problem is largely a measurement gap, because many digital goods and services are not accurately captured in official statistics. But a recent study by two economists from the Federal Reserve and one from the International Monetary Fund casts doubt on that theory. Technology spending has been robust, rising 54 percent over a decade to $727 billion last year, according to the research firm IDC. Despite all the smartphone sales to consumers, most of the spending is by companies investing in technology to increase growth and productivity. But an industry-by-industry analysis, published by the McKinsey Global Institute, the research arm of the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, found that the march of digital technology across the economy has a long way to go. The McKinsey researchers examined 22 industries, measuring not only investment but also the use of technology to change how work is done. Some industries, like technology, media and financial services, were well along, while others, like health care and hospitality, trailed. Only 18 percent of the American economy is living up to its ""digital potential,"" the report concluded. And if lagging industries do not catch up, we will not see much of a change in national economic statistics, said James Manyika, a director of the McKinsey Global Institute. Since the financial crisis, the Obama administration has moved aggressively to push medicine into the digital age. As part of the economic recovery package, Congress enacted the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009. The legislation provided for federal incentive payments of $44,000 a physician to shift to electronic health records. The billions of dollars in subsidies were intended to accelerate adoption. And from 2008 to 2014, the share of hospitals with electronic health records rose to 75 percent from 9 percent, while the adoption rate in doctors' offices rose to 51 percent from 17 percent, according to the most recent surveys by the American Hospital Association and the government. ""The government funding has made a huge difference,"" said Dr. Ashish Jha, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health. ""But we're seeing little evidence so far that all this technology has had much effect on quality and costs."" The electronic records, health experts say, represent only a first step toward curbing costs and improving care. ""People confuse information automation with creating the kind of work environment where productivity and creativity can flourish,"" said Dr. David J. Brailer, who was the national health technology coordinator in the George W. Bush administration. ""And so little has gone into changing work so far."" The government incentives came with timetables for adopting different levels of use and new reporting requirements, with the prospect of financial penalties for doctors and hospitals that fell behind. The early goals for adopting electronic records were reasonable, health experts say, but the later stages were too aggressive. Overwhelmed doctors protested, and the administration recently shelved the previous timetable, stretching out schedules and modifying some reporting rules. Healthstar Physicians, the 50-doctor group in Morristown, Tenn., where Dr. Sutherland practices, was spurred to go electronic by those federal incentive payments, which now total $32 billion. But the cultural adjustment to digital technology has been challenging. Dr. Sutherland and his colleagues evaluated several technology providers and chose Athenahealth, which does not sell software but is paid a percentage of its customers' revenue. Healthstar started using Athenahealth's cloud software in 2012, first for billing and then for electronic health records. Athenahealth's share is less than 5 percent of the group's revenue. Today, Dr. Sutherland's personal income and the medical group's revenue are about 8 percent below where they were four years ago. But in 2015, both his earnings and the revenue of Healthstar, which employs 350 people in 10 clinics, increased slightly, by nearly 3 percent from 2014. Dr. Sutherland decided he did not want a computer screen separating him from his patients. So he opted for a tablet computer, making it easier to keep eye contact. Not a fast typist, Dr. Sutherland decided to use voice recognition software. For six months, he stayed up until midnight most nights, training the software until its speech recognition engine could transcribe his comments into text with few mistakes. Dr. Sutherland bemoans the countless data fields he must fill in to comply with government-mandated reporting rules, and he concedes that some of his colleagues hate using digital records. Yet Dr. Sutherland is no hater. Despite the extra work the new technology has created and even though it has not yet had the expected financial payoff, he thinks it has helped him provide better information to patients. He values being able to tap the screen to look up potentially harmful drug interactions and to teach patients during visits. He can, for example, quickly create charts to show diabetes patients how they are progressing with treatment plans, managing blood glucose levels and weight loss. He is working harder, Dr. Sutherland says, but he believes he is a better doctor. Blunt measures of productivity, he added, aren't everything. ""My patients are better served,"" he said. ""And I'm happier."""
0,2016-06-09," Thomas J. Perkins, who nurtured Silicon Valley's venture capital industry into a force that later helped foster the growth of companies like Google and Amazon, died Tuesday night at his home in Marin County, Calif. He was 84. His longtime assistant, Kathy Daly, said Mr. Perkins died after a prolonged illness, which she did not specify. Mr. Perkins co-founded the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in 1972, at a time when parts of Silicon Valley were still fruit orchards. Mr. Perkins and his partners popularized a model of investment that involved putting small amounts of money into promising young start-ups in return for a stake in the companies, giving them advice and counsel to spur their growth. Some of the investments turned into gigantic hits. Mr. Perkins had said that his favorite investment was Genentech, a biotechnology company that has since been acquired by Roche. Over time, Kleiner Perkins — and its home on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, Calif. — became a destination for other venture capitalists. Mr. Perkins helped recruit venture capitalists like John Doerr to his firm, leading to investments in a new generation of technology companies, including Netscape, AOL, Amazon and later Google. The firm's success transformed Silicon Valley and the technology and biotechnology industries, leading to a proliferation of venture firms in the region and creating an ecosystem of investment in start-ups that today remains unrivaled in any other part of the world. Later in his life, Mr. Perkins was embroiled in several controversies. In 1996, he was convicted in France of involuntary manslaughter from a yacht collision. In another, he stepped down from the board of Hewlett-Packard in 2006 after he said the company had used illegal methods to obtain his phone records. The allegations led to the resignation of H.P.'s chairwoman and an overhaul of the board. He also publicly broke with Kleiner Perkins in 2014 after writing an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal in which he compared the ""progressive war on the American 1 percent"" to the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany. The comments set off a firestorm, and the firm moved to distance itself from Mr. Perkins, who later apologized for his language. David A. Kaplan, who wrote a biography of Mr. Perkins titled ""Mine's Bigger: The Extraordinary Tale of the World's Greatest Sailboat and the Silicon Valley Tycoon Who Built It"" (2007), said in an interview on Thursday that Mr. Perkins's ""legacy won't be helped by all the excessive things he said in recent years and the grudges he nursed,"" though he was a ""seminal figure"" for Silicon Valley. In a statement on Thursday, two other Kleiner Perkins co-founders, Brook Byers and Frank Caufield, said Mr. Perkins had ""defined what we know of today as entrepreneurial venture capital by going beyond just funding to helping entrepreneurs realize their visions with operating expertise."" Mr. Perkins was flamboyant with his wealth, though he had said that he was a multimillionaire and not a billionaire, as many believed. At one point he was an avid collector of Bugatti cars; at another, he commissioned a state-of-the-art 289-foot clipper yacht called the Maltese Falcon, telling the CBS program ""60 Minutes"" in a profile that it had cost at least $150 million and less than $300 million. That lifestyle was the backdrop to one of several books he wrote, a novel titled ""Sex and the Single Zillionaire"" (2006), which featured a yacht on its cover. For the book, Mr. Perkins had guidance from the romance novelist Danielle Steel, whom he married in 1998; the marriage ended in divorce. He dedicated the novel to her. Thomas James Perkins was born on Jan. 7, 1932, and grew up in White Plains in modest circumstances, attending White Plains High School. His father, Harry, worked for an insurance company, and his mother, Elizabeth, was an occasional seamstress. He became interested in technology early. In a 2007 autobiography, ""Valley Boy: The Education of Tom Perkins,"" he wrote that as a youth he assembled television kits and had planned to be a TV repairman. Accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he studied electrical engineering and computer science, earning his bachelor's degree in both. He later received an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School. After working for a time for Sperry Gyroscope Company in Great Neck, on Long Island, he moved to California, where he worked in the technology industry for a decade He joined H.P. in the 1960s, working for the company's founders, David Packard and William Hewlett. In his autobiography, Mr. Perkins wrote that Mr. Packard and Mr. Hewlett ""were restless and driven men."" ""Their aspirations always reached beyond the present success,"" he added, noting that he had been ""fortunate to have come knocking on their door."" When Mr. Perkins and Eugene Kleiner founded Kleiner Perkins in 1972 (Mr. Byers and Mr. Caufield joined later), Silicon Valley knew little of venture capital, and the men had the field largely to themselves, investing in fledgling companies like Tandem Computers, Applied Materials and Genentech. Mr. Perkins later stepped away from active venture investing and joined several corporate boards over the years, including Compaq Computer and News Corp. Compaq was purchased by H.P. in 2002, and Mr. Perkins joined H.P.'s board in 2005, not long before its chief executive at the time, Carly Fiorina, was fired. Mr. Perkins supported Ms. Fiorina's recent run for the Republican presidential nomination. Before his marriage to Ms. Steel, Mr. Perkins was married to Gerd Thune-Ellefsen, a Norwegian whom he had met skiing near Lake Tahoe, until her death in 1994. He is survived by two children from that marriage, a son, Tor, and a daughter, Elizabeth."
0,2016-06-10," SAN FRANCISCO — Apple's iPhone would be just a well-made phone without the apps that allow people to personalize it with their favorite games, news, business, social and video services. Software makers need Apple, too: They badly want to be on the devices that people carry with them everywhere, especially as traditional websites and desktop computers fade in importance. When Apple's App Store opened in 2008, there were well under a thousand apps, and the relationship was obviously beneficial for both sides. But now, when there are more than 1.5 million apps fighting for attention in the App Store, the benefits for developers, particularly smaller ones, have become much less apparent. ""Is Apple coasting on its relationship and lead with developers? I think the answer is yes,"" said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. ""Their app store is considered an unappealing experience by many people. Their rules are arbitrary, and they take a big slice of money from sales."" For a long time, Apple didn't have to care. But now it faces flat sales of its flagship iPhones, a lack of excitement about newer products like its smart watch and Apple TV, growing competition from Google's Android platform and the rise of new challengers like Amazon's Echo device, which responds to a user's voice commands at home with the kind of magic that used to be an Apple hallmark. As the company prepares to hold its annual developer conference in San Francisco next week, there are signs that it wants to improve its relationship with app makers. Among the announcements expected at the gathering: Apple plans to finally give developers access to its Siri voice assistant so they can incorporate it into their apps. Apple's charm offensive began in earnest in December, after it put Philip W. Schiller, its senior vice president of worldwide marketing, in charge of the App Store. Under Mr. Schiller, the company accelerated the app approval process, cutting typical review times from two weeks to a day or two. On Wednesday, Apple announced that it would soon begin allowing app makers to buy ads that would appear at the top of search results in the App Store, like the ads already on Google's Play Store and website. Apple also said that it would cut its usual 30 percent commission on all subscriptions to 15 percent after an app subscriber had been active for at least a year. ""That's the right thing to do for developers,"" said Bob Bowman, president of business and media at Major League Baseball, which makes one of the most popular subscription apps, MLB.com At Bat, for live-streaming baseball games. Big outfits like Major League Baseball have always been treated well by Apple. The league had an app ready at the 2008 unveiling of the App Store, and Mr. Bowman said he talked regularly with Mr. Schiller and Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president for internet software and services. Smaller developers tend to have less satisfying experiences. Loni Schuman, a 23-year-old entrepreneur in Israel, was frustrated by the process of getting her app, Fanify, approved. Fanify allows musicians to live-stream concerts, with viewers dropping tips into a virtual jar to compensate them — ""like a street artist, but in an app,"" as Ms. Schuman put it. She planned a June 1 release and had several artists lined up to promote the app during its first few days. She submitted the app for approval 10 days ahead of time to allow plenty of time for review. Apple's initial response was quick, but Fanify ended up in an extended back and forth as it tried to address various problems. At one point, Apple raised a fundamental objection, saying that Fanify's method for tipping artists, which used the online payment services Venmo and PayPal, violated Apple's requirement that all in-app payments be routed through iTunes so the company could take its 30 percent cut. Ms. Schuman and her developer had to rewrite the app to force users to buy tokens that they could then use to tip musicians. The app was finally approved on Thursday, nine days after the first concerts were supposed to have taken place. ""It ruined our whole launch,"" she said. Apple declined requests to interview Mr. Schiller or other executives about its relationship with developers. The company said in January that the App Store had generated nearly $40 billion in revenue for developers since it was created. Getting an app noticed is one of the biggest problems for a small developer. The search function in the App Store follows no apparent logic in displaying results, leaving most apps lost in the pile. Apple's system for choosing which ones to highlight on the front page of the store is similarly opaque. ""It used to feel like a frontier town where lots of people bought apps and tried new things,"" said Phill Ryu, who helped found the software studio Impending. ""Now it feels more like a lottery ticket."" When an app maker wins that lottery, the benefits are tremendous. Craig Tashman, the founder of LiquidText, a document annotation app for the iPad and iPad Pro, managed to get on Apple's radar early, when a company employee in his network made an introduction in 2012. Apple asked Dr. Tashman to keep in touch as he developed the app over the next few years, and LiquidText was showcased in the App Store for two weeks when the app was introduced last September. ""We got a banner right on top of the App Store,"" he said. ""We got 100,000 downloads in two weeks."" When the iPad Pro was introduced in November, LiquidText received another round of promotion from Apple. The new search ads for the App Store will allow developers to buy attention if they are not lucky enough to get that kind of free publicity from Apple's editors. Although the ads will be available to everyone, it is unclear whether prime search terms will end up being bought mostly by big marketers. App developers, most notably game makers, spent $3 billion last year in the United States alone to promote downloads of their software inside Facebook, Twitter and other apps, according to eMarketer. Bryan Wiener, executive chairman of 360i, a digital advertising agency, predicted that airlines, retailers and video streaming services would eagerly pay for advertising slots in the App Store. ""Search will be table stakes,"" he said. While overall app download trends favor a handful of top developers, Apple has made other moves to improve life for the smaller fry. The company is giving more guidance to developers about ways to market their apps, said Brian Mueller, who has been an Apple developer for three years. He makes the Carrot series of apps, including ones for weather, exercise and to-do lists. Apple is also more actively choosing what appears on the front page of the App Store, where popular, new and interesting apps are prominently featured. ""It signals to users that the App Store is a place to check throughout the week,"" Mr. Mueller said. ""A lot of developers were asking and hoping for this."" Developers say they still hope Apple will make more improvements. They want the company to continue to improve search in the App Store and let developers respond to user comments. They also say that communication with Apple is still largely one-way. ""You can't fix overnight all of the grievances that piled up,"" Mr. Ryu said."

 VIACOM RUMBLINGS   |  National Amusements, the theater chain through which Sumner M. Redstone controls his $40 billion empire, is preparing to replace directors on the Viacom board in a move that is expected to lead to the ouster of the companyâs embattled chief executive,
Emily Steel reports in The New York Times. Kenneth Lerer, the venture capitalist who helped found The Huffington Post and is the chairman at BuzzFeed, and Nicole Seligman, a former Sony executive and lawyer who represented President Bill Clinton during his impeachment trial, are being considered, according to people briefed on the discussions.  Also on the list are Judith McHale, the former Discovery Communications chief, and Thomas J. May, the chairman of Eversource Energy utility company, these people said.  It is unclear whether these people have formally accepted the positions.  One possibility that has been discussed is having the new Viacom board serve a short term before National Amusements pushes to merge Viacom with CBS, the other entertainment company it controls. Viacom and CBS were split into two companies in 2006.  At the same time, given the latest move by National Amusements, Viacom is still presumably trying to decide whether to amend its bylaws, a move that would  prevent a sale of the Paramount movie studio. It had four business days after Mondayâs announcement to file the new amendments, but has not yet done so, Steven Davidoff Solomon writes in DealBook. The problem for Viacom is that its directors other than Mr. Redstone have decided to oppose a leadership change and support Philippe P. Dauman, the chief executive. Mr. Daumanâs opposition is based on claims that Mr. Redstone is not competent, which somehow translate to the actions of National Amusementsâ board being illegitimate.  If Viacom accepts the changes, it will be admitting that National Amusements can act appropriately with regard to Viacom and thus, that Mr. Redstone and National Amusements can remove the board.  Viacom could try to kick the can down the road, by filing the changes, saying vaguely that they were illegal. Or it could challenge the changes in court. A bylaw requiring 100 percent board approval is unusual, but there is precedent for the validity of this type of bylaw under Delaware law, Mr. Davidoff Solomon writes. Viacom would most likely argue that the controlling shareholder is overreaching.  There is also the option of claiming that National Amusementsâ amendments are void because of claims of Mr. Redstoneâs incompetency. But this would be hard to establish as National Amusements has its own board and is a functioning company. And if Mr. Redstone is indeed incompetent, then his interest goes to the trust from which Mr. Dauman and George Abrams have been removed.  If Viacom does pursue litigation, it may be a cue for National Amusements and Mr. Redstone to finally unseat the Viacom board. National Amusements could also invoke the seldom-used summary procedures in the Delaware code for contested elections of directors and procedures to confirm the validity of its appointments. This would allow National Amusements to raise the ante if Viacom does litigate over the amended bylaws.  Viacom has difficult decisions to make and very little time to make them in.

 TIGHTER RULES ON REMITTANCES SQUEEZE BUSINESSES   |  Banks are refusing to do business with money transmitters, closing or freezing their accounts over concerns about money laundering and extra regulatory scrutiny,
Elinor Comlay reports in DealBook. Convenience stores that handle remittances need an account to deposit the cash, but because it is so hard for banks to know the identity of the final customer, remittances companies and their agents are being categorized as high risk for money laundering.  This has affected mom-and-pop convenience stores, potentially limiting options for the millions of people living in the United States who want to send money home. Over a quarter of American households rely on nonbank financial institutions, including money transmitters, for everyday banking needs, according to the Conference of State Bank Supervisors.  Mexico is the biggest destination for money transfers from the United States, according to estimates by the World Bank. About $24.3 billion was remitted to there from the United States last year, practically all the cross-border money that flowed to Mexico and one-fifth of all remittances sense from the United States. But while it was once viewed as a big consumer business opportunity, American banks now see it as a liability.  Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase scrapped their low-cost remittance services two years ago. Last year, Citigroup agreed to pay $140 million to regulators for failing to safeguard against money laundering and shut down its Banamex USA Unit.  AmeriMex Communications, a company that sells cellphone minutes to people in the United States to give to family or friends in Mexico, has started to work with convenience store owners on a prepay basis because many are also money-transfer agents and their bank accounts have been frozen, said Don Aldridge, AmeriMexâs chief executive.   Regulators are aware of these problems â they say there is a wider trend of banks closing potentially risky accounts because of the costs of monitoring and compliance.   âThe fact that, over the same time period, the overall level of U.S.-to-Mexico remittances appears to be healthy and growing may indicate that some of the weaker institutions are losing access and the market may be consolidating under stronger participants â which would not be a bad thing,â said Daniel L. Glaser, assistant Treasury secretary for terrorist financing. However critics say that the dollar amount of transfers has been rising steadily since the financial crisis so the data reflects the health of the economy, rather than the health of the money-transfer market. And  regulators are concerned that people will resort to sending cash across the border, a method that is riskier and harder to track.

0,2016-06-15," Turn off your cellphones. Unwrap your candy. And put on those headsets. An immersive stage show that makes heavy use of binaural technology (3-D audio) for drama is coming to Broadway this fall after a sold-out run in London and arts festival appearances throughout Europe. ""The Encounter,"" inspired by Petru Popescu's novel ""Amazon Beaming,"" is loosely about a National Geographic photographer's experience with a mystical tribe in Brazil in 1969. But, as directed and performed by the British director Simon McBurney, it is also an exploration of the nature of reality, and the meaning of storytelling. ""I became fascinated with the whole process of memory — what the relationship is between the actual way memory works in the brain, and the effect of that in our lives,"" Mr. McBurney said in a telephone interview. ""I had this story, and my own personal obsession, and they started to wind around each other like a double helix, and gradually I began to find a form which seemed to me to be deeply dramatic and theatrical — compelling as a story, but also as a set of things that provoke and question the imagination of the audience."" Mr. McBurney, who created the show for Complicite, a company he co-founded, said ""The Encounter"" is partly about solitude. ""It is very intimate, because of the technology, and I want people to go on that journey,"" he said. The show began its life last summer at the Edinburgh International Festival, and then was staged at the Barbican Theater in London early this year; it has also been performed at festivals in Britain, Greece, Switzerland, Austria, France and the Netherlands. In a review of the London production in The New York Times, Ben Brantley wrote that ""The Encounter"" is ""one of the most fully immersive theater pieces ever created"" and described it as ""a journey to the center of your mind that begins in your auditory nerves and keeps burrowing deeper."" The Broadway production will begin previews Sept. 20 and open Sept. 29 at the John Golden Theater; it is scheduled to run through Jan. 8. Mr. McBurney said he hoped to do most of the performances, but another actor, Richard Katz, will step in as needed. (""Eight shows a week is steep with this show,"" Mr. McBurney said. ""It's difficult to explain, but it's very tough."") Mr. McBurney has worked on Broadway twice before, as the director of a 1998 revival of ""The Chairs,"" by Eugene Ionesco, and of a 2008 revival of Arthur Miller's ""All My Sons."""
1,2016-06-15," One night in early January, a little after 9 o'clock, a dozen Netflix employees gathered in the cavernous Palazzo ballroom of the Venetian in Las Vegas. They had come to rehearse an announcement the company would be making the next morning at the Consumer Electronics Show, the tech industry's gigantic annual conference. For the previous year, Netflix had been plotting secretly to expand the availability of its streaming entertainment service, then accessible in about 60 countries, to most of the rest of the world. Up to this point, Netflix had been entering one or two countries at a time, to lots of fanfare. Now it was going to move into 130 new countries all at once, including major markets like Russia, India and South Korea. (The only significant holdout, for now, was China, where the company says it is still ""exploring potential partnerships."") Netflix executives saw this as a significant step toward the future they have long imagined for the company, a supremacy in home entertainment akin to what Facebook enjoys in social media, Uber in urban transportation or Amazon in online retailing. Ted Sarandos, who runs Netflix's Hollywood operation and makes the company's deals with networks and studios, was up first to rehearse his lines. ""Pilots, the fall season, summer repeats, live ratings"" — all hallmarks of traditional television — were falling away because of Netflix, he boasted. Unlike a network, which needs shows that are ratings ""home runs"" to maximize viewers and hence ad dollars, he continued, Netflix also values ""singles"" and ""doubles"" that appeal to narrower segments of subscribers. Its ability to analyze vast amounts of data about its customers' viewing preferences helped it decide what content to buy and how much to pay for it. Sarandos can be an outspoken, even gleeful, critic of network practices in his zeal to promote what Netflix views as its superior model — on-demand and commercial-free streaming, on any device. That glee was on full display in these remarks. For years, he said, ""consumers have been at the mercy of others when it comes to television. The shows and movies they want to watch are subject to business models they do not understand and do not care about. All they know is frustration."" That, he added, ""is the insight Netflix is built on."" When Sarandos was done, Reed Hastings, Netflix's chairman and chief executive, took the stage. A pencil-thin man, he seemed swallowed up by the empty ballroom. He squinted uncomfortably under the lights. He and a number of other Netflix executives had spent the morning at a meeting in Laguna, Calif., where a rare torrential rainstorm grounded air traffic, forcing them to make the five-hour drive to Las Vegas. They arrived only a few hours earlier. To make matters worse, Hastings was feeling ill. Haggard and tired, he stumbled irritably through his presentation. But as he neared the finale, Hastings broke out into a small, satisfied smile. ""While you have been listening to me talk,"" he said, reading from a monitor, ""the Netflix service has gone live in nearly every country in the world but China, where we also hope to be in the future."" Even though this was only a practice run — and even though it would be a long time before anyone knew whether global expansion would pay off — the Netflix executives sitting in the ballroom let out a loud, sustained cheer. They had good reason to celebrate. Netflix, since its streaming service debuted in 2007, has had its annual revenue grow sixfold, to $6.8 billion from $1.2 billion. More than 81 million subscribers pay Netflix $8 to $12 a month, and slowly but unmistakably these consumers are giving up cable for internet television: Over the last five years, cable has lost 6.7 million subscribers; more than a quarter of millennials (70 percent of whom use streaming services) report having never subscribed to cable in their lives. Those still paying for cable television were watching less of it. In 2015, for instance, television viewing time was down 3 percent; and 50 percent of that drop was directly attributable to Netflix, according to a study by MoffettNathanson, an investment firm that tracks the media business. All of this has made Netflix a Wall Street favorite, with a stock price that rose 134 percent last year. Easy access to capital has allowed the company to bid aggressively on content for its service. This year Netflix will spend $5 billion, nearly three times what HBO spends, on content, which includes what it licenses, shows like AMC's ""Better Call Saul,"" and original series like ""House of Cards."" Its dozens of original shows (more than 600 hours of original programming are planned for this year) often receive as much critical acclaim and popular buzz as anything available on cable. Having invented the binge-streaming phenomenon when it became the first company to put a show's entire season online at once, it then secured a place in the popular culture: ""Netflix and chill."" But the assembled executives also had reason to worry. Just because Netflix had essentially created this new world of internet TV was no guarantee that it could continue to dominate it. Hulu, a streaming service jointly owned by 21st Century Fox, Disney and NBC Universal, had become more assertive in licensing and developing shows, vying with Netflix for deals. And there was other competition as well: small companies like Vimeo and giants like Amazon, an aggressive buyer of original series. Even the networks, which long considered Netflix an ally, had begun to fight back by developing their own streaming apps. Last fall, Time Warner hinted that it was considering withholding its shows from Netflix and other streaming services for a longer period. John Landgraf, the chief executive of the FX networks — and one of the company's fiercest critics — told a reporter a few months ago, ""I look at Netflix as a company that's trying to take over the world."" At the moment, Netflix has a negative cash flow of almost $1 billion; it regularly needs to go to the debt market to replenish its coffers. Its $6.8 billion in revenue last year pales in comparison to the $28 billion or so at media giants like Time Warner and 21st Century Fox. And for all the original shows Netflix has underwritten, it remains dependent on the very networks that fear its potential to destroy their longtime business model in the way that internet competitors undermined the newspaper and music industries. Now that so many entertainment companies see it as an existential threat, the question is whether Netflix can continue to thrive in the new TV universe that it has brought into being. To hear Reed Hastings explain it, there was never any doubt in his mind that, as he told me during one interview, ""all TV will move to the internet, and linear TV will cease to be relevant over the next 20 years, like fixed-line telephones."" Viewers, in other words, will no longer sit and watch a show when a network dictates. According to Hastings, Netflix may have begun as a DVD rental company — remember those red envelopes? — but he always assumed that it would one day deliver TV shows and movies through the internet, allowing customers to watch them whenever they wanted. Now that future has begun to take shape. The television industry last went through this sort of turbulence in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when cable television was maturing. Previously, of course, television had been mostly transmitted via the public airwaves, and the major networks made the bulk of their money from advertising. But cable provided an indisputably better picture, and the proliferation of cable networks came to offer a much greater variety of programming. In time, consumers concluded that it was worth paying for something — TV — that had previously been free. This meant that in addition to advertising dollars, each cable channel received revenue from all cable customers, even those who didn't watch that channel. By 2000, 68.5 million Americans had subscriptions, giving them access to the several hundred channels the industry took to calling ""the cable bundle."" Hastings knew the internet would eventually compete with that bundle, but he wasn't entirely sure how. And so he had to be flexible. Sarandos says that in 1999, Hastings thought shows would be downloaded rather than streamed. At another point, Netflix created a dedicated device through which to access its content, only to decide that adapting its service to everything from mobile phones to TV sets made more sense. (The Netflix device was spun out into its own company, Roku.) In 2007, even as Netflix's DVD-by-mail business remained lucrative, and long before the internet was ready to deliver a streaming movie without fits and starts, Hastings directed Netflix to build a stand-alone streaming service. Netflix's approach to what it streams has been similarly flexible. At first, the company focused on movies, logically enough: 80 percent of its DVD rentals were films. But despite deals with two premium movie channels, Starz and Epix, Netflix found the distribution system to be largely inhospitable. Netflix usually didn't get access to a new movie until a year or so after it ran in theaters. It then held the distribution rights for only 12 to 18 months; eventually, the movie went to free TV for the next seven or eight years. This frustrated customers who couldn't understand why something was there one month and gone the next or why, for that matter, so many titles were missing entirely from Netflix's catalog. So the company shifted to television. Cable networks like FX and AMC were developing expensive, talked-about dramas, the kind HBO pioneered with ""The Sopranos"" and ""The Wire."" But these series, with their complex, season-long story arcs and hourlong format, seemed to be poor candidates for syndication, unlike self-contained, half-hour sitcoms like ""Seinfeld,"" which can be watched out of order. Hastings and Sarandos realized that Netflix could become, in effect, the syndicator for these hourlong dramas: ""We found an inefficiency,"" is how Hastings describes this insight. One of the first such series to appear on Netflix was AMC's ""Mad Men,"" which became available on the site in 2011, between its fourth and fifth seasons. Knowing from its DVD experience that customers often rented a full season of ""The Sopranos"" in one go, Netflix put the entire first four seasons of ""Mad Men"" online at once. Bingeing took off. Television networks lined up to license their shows to Netflix, failing to see the threat it posed to the established order. ""It's a bit like 'Is the Albanian Army going to take over the world?' "" Jeff Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, famously joked back in 2010. The occasional voice warned that Netflix would become too big for the industry to control, but mostly the legacy media companies viewed the fees from Netflix as found money. ""Streaming video on-demand"" rights, as they were called, hadn't even existed before Netflix asked to pay for them. And because the networks didn't understand how valuable those rights would become, Netflix got them for very little money. Everyone seemed to be a winner, including the shows themselves. In 2012, for instance, Netflix began streaming the first three seasons of ""Breaking Bad,"" the dark drama produced by Sony that ran on AMC. Though praised by critics, ""Breaking Bad"" had not yet found its audience. ""When the folks at Sony said we were going to be on Netflix, I didn't really know what that meant,"" Vince Gilligan, the creator of ""Breaking Bad,"" told me. ""I knew Netflix was a company that sent you DVDs in the mail. I didn't even know what streaming was."" Gilligan quickly found out. ""It really kicked our viewership into high gear,"" he says. As Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, put it to me: "" 'Breaking Bad' was 10 times more popular once it started streaming on Netflix."" This was around the time that network executives started to recognize the threat that Netflix could eventually constitute to them. ""Five years ago,"" says Richard Greenfield, a media and technology analyst at BTIG who happens to be Netflix's most vocal proponent on Wall Street, ""we wrote a piece saying that the networks shouldn't license to Netflix because they were going to unleash a monster that would undermine their business."" That's exactly what seemed to be happening. Worse, they realized that Netflix didn't have to play by the same rules they did. It didn't care when people watched the shows it licensed. It had no vested interest in preserving the cable bundle. On the contrary, the more consumers who ""cut the cord,"" the better for Netflix. It didn't have billions of legacy profits to protect. Yet the networks couldn't walk away from the company either. Many of them needed licensing fees from Netflix to make up for the revenue they were losing as traditional viewership shrank. Negotiations between a network or a studio and Netflix became fraught, as the networks, understanding the value of their streaming rights, sought much higher fees. In some cases, those negotiations broke down. The Starz deal, for example, was not renewed after it ended in 2012. (Chris Albrecht, the chief executive of Starz, would later describe the original deal as ""terrible."") This was also the moment that Netflix started to plot its move into original programming. In 2012, Sarandos began to argue internally that to stand apart from the crowd, and to avoid being at the networks' mercy, Netflix needed exclusive content that it fully controlled. ""If we were going to start having to fend for ourselves in content,"" Sarandos says, ""we had better start exercising that muscle now."" In short, Netflix needed to begin buying its own shows. ""We could see that eventually AMC was going to be able to do its own on-demand streaming,"" Hastings says. ""Or FX. We knew there was no long-term business in being a rerun company, just as we knew there was no long-term business in being a DVD-rental company."" Still, Hastings was cautious. Producing original material is a very different business from licensing someone else's shows. New content requires hefty upfront costs — one show alone would most likely cost more than the $30 million a year Netflix reportedly once paid Starz for its entire library of movies. Developing its own series would thrust it into the unfamiliar business of engaging with producers, directors and stars. Back in 2006, the company set up a way to distribute independent films, called Red Envelope Entertainment, but it failed, and Hastings shut it down. (""We would have been better off spending the money on DVDs,"" he told me.) Now it was going to give original content another try — with much higher stakes. Sarandos had a show he was itching to buy: ""House of Cards,"" a political drama that was being pitched by David Fincher, the well-known director, and would star Kevin Spacey. Sarandos knew that, according to Netflix's vast database, many of the company's subscribers liked the kind of drama that Fincher and Spacey wanted to make. But algorithms alone weren't the deciding factor. He and Hastings figured that Fincher, who directed films like ""Fight Club"" and ""The Social Network,"" would create a critical and popular sensation. In any case, Sarandos said, the potential reward vastly outweighed whatever financial and reputational risk ""House of Cards"" represented. ""If it is a flop, we will have overpaid for one series,"" he told Hastings. ""But if it succeeds, we will have changed the brand."" In winning over Fincher, Sarandos faced two other obstacles: a competing offer from HBO, which also wanted ""House of Cards,"" and the fact that no one had ever made a show for a streaming service before. For decades, when movies went straight to video without a theater run, they were ipso facto failures in Hollywood's view; for a seasoned director like Fincher, picking Netflix presented the same risk of marginalization. Sarandos overcame both by offering freedom and money. ""There are a thousand reasons for you not to do this with Netflix,"" he told Fincher. ""But if you go with us, we'll commit to two seasons with no pilot and no interference."" Sarandos also offered Fincher a reported $100 million for 26 episodes, at the high end for an hourlong drama. The first season of ""House of Cards"" became available in February 2013. It was an immediate hit with viewers and critics. Five months later, Netflix posted the first season of ""Orange Is the New Black,"" which Sarandos had ordered before ""House of Cards"" went into production. Critics lavished praise on the new show as well. Having begun its life as a Silicon Valley tech company, Netflix had somewhat improbably become a television network. Reed Hastings doesn't have an office. ""My office is my phone,"" he says. ""I found I was rarely using my cubicle, and I just had no need for it. It is better for me to be meeting people all around the building."" On the several occasions I interviewed him at the company's headquarters in Los Gatos, Calif., we met in the cafeteria. Although Netflix employees describe him as an intense, blunt boss, Hastings comes across in public as relaxed and undefensive. He spent our interviews leaning back in his chair, his arms folded and legs crossed, tossing off answers to my questions as if it were a day at the beach. Born and raised in the Boston suburbs — his great-grandfather was the wealthy investor Alfred Lee Loomis, who played a critical role in the invention of radar — Hastings, now 55, is one of those tech executives who came to California to attend Stanford (grad school for computer science in his case) and never left. The tech company he ran before Netflix was called Pure Software, which made debugging tools for software engineers. Before Netflix, Hastings had no experience in the entertainment industry. Although news coverage now tends to focus on its shows, Netflix remains every bit as much an engineering company as it is a content company. There is a reason that its shows rarely suffer from streaming glitches, even though, at peak times, they can sometimes account for 37 percent of internet traffic: in 2011 Netflix engineers set up their own content-delivery network, with servers in more than 1,000 locations. Its user interface is relentlessly tested and tweaked to make it more appealing to users. Netflix has the ability to track what people watch, at what time of day, whether they watch all the way through or stop after 10 minutes. Netflix uses ""personalization"" algorithms to put shows in front of its subscribers that are likely to appeal to them. Nathanson, the analyst, says: ""They are a tech company. Their strength is that they have a really good product."" It is no surprise that Hastings, given his engineering background, believes that data, above all else, yields answers — and the bigger the data set, the better. ""The worst thing you can do at Netflix is say that you showed it to 12 people in a focus room and they loved it,"" says Todd Yellin, the company's vice president of product innovation. He likes to note that customers will at most consider only 40 to 50 shows or movies before deciding what to watch, which makes it crucial that the company puts just the right 50 titles on each subscriber's screen. (All the data Netflix collects and dissects can yield surprising correlations: For example, viewers who like ""House of Cards"" also often like the FX comedy ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia."") There is another underappreciated aspect of Netflix that Hastings views as a competitive advantage: what he calls its ""high performance"" culture. The company seeks out and rewards star performers while unapologetically pushing out the rest. One person who helped Hastings create that culture is a woman named Patty McCord. The former head of human resources at Pure Software, she was also Hastings's neighbor in Santa Cruz. She car-pooled to work with him and socialized with his family on weekends. ""I thought the idea for Netflix was kind of stupid,"" she told me. But she trusted Hastings's instincts and wanted to keep working with him. Her title was chief talent officer. The origins of the Netflix culture date to October 2001. The internet bubble burst the year before, and Netflix, once flush with venture capital, was running out of money. Netflix had to lay off roughly 50 employees, shrinking the staff by a third. ""It was Reed's first layoffs,"" McCord says. ""It was painful."" The remaining 100 or so employees, despite working harder than before, enjoyed their jobs more. McCord and Hastings concluded that the reason was that they had held onto the self-motivated employees who assumed responsibility naturally. Office politics virtually disappeared; nobody had the time or the patience. ""There was unusual clarity,"" McCord says. ""It was our survival. It was either make this work or we're dead."" McCord says Hastings told her, ""This is what a great company feels like."" As luck would have it, the DVD business took off right around the time of the layoffs. By May 2002, Netflix was doing well enough to go public, selling 5.5 million shares at $15 a share. With the $82.5 million Netflix reaped from the offering, Hastings started hiring aggressively again. This time, he and McCord focused on hiring ""fully formed adults,"" in their words, go-getters who put the company's interests ahead of their own egos, showed initiative without being asked and embraced accountability. Dissent and argument were encouraged, even demanded. For those who fit in, Netflix was a great place to work — empowering and rational. There are no performance reviews, no limits on vacation time or maternity leave in the first year and a one-sentence expense policy: Do what is in the company's best interest. But those who could not adapt found that their tenure at Netflix was stressful and short-lived. There was pressure on newcomers to show that they had what it took to make it at Netflix; those who didn't were let go. ""Reed would say, 'Why are we coming up with performance plans for people who are not going to work out?' "" McCord says. Instead, Netflix simply wrote them a check and parted ways. McCord also convinced Hastings that he should ask himself a few times a year whether he would hire the same person in the same job if it opened up that day. If the answer was no, Netflix would write a larger check and let the employee go. ""If you are going to insist on high performance,"" McCord says, ""then you have to get rid of the notion of retention. You'll have to fire some really nice, hard-working people. But you have to do it with dignity. ""I held the hands of people weeping, saying, 'I want to be here forever,' "" McCord says. ""I would tell them, 'Nothing lasts forever.' I would say to Reed, 'I love them, too, but it is our job to be sure that we always have the right people.' "" In 2004, the culture was codified enough for Netflix to put it on a sequence of slides, which it posted on its corporate website five years later. It is an extraordinary document, 124 slides in all, covering everything from its salaries (it pays employees what it believes a competitor trying to poach them would) to why it rejects ""brilliant jerks"" (""cost to effective teamwork is too high""). The key concept is summed up in the 23rd slide. ""We're a team, not a family,"" it reads. ""Netflix leaders hire, develop and cut smartly, so we have stars in every position."" After Hastings, the executive I spent the most time with at Netflix was Yellin, a former independent filmmaker who joined the company in early 2006, when he was in his early 40s. Yellin quickly distinguished himself by pushing back hard whenever he thought Hastings was wrong about something. ""There was a culture of questioning, but I pushed the envelope,"" he says. He also helped develop a style of meeting that I'd never seen before. At the one I sat in on, there were maybe 50 people in a small circular room with three tiers of seats, like a tiny coliseum, allowing everyone to easily see everyone else. The issue at hand seemed pretty small to me: They were discussing whether montages on the opening screen of the user interface would be more effective in keeping subscribers than still images or trailers. But the intensity of the discussion made it clear that the group took the matter very seriously. Various hypotheses had been tested by sending out montages to 100,000 or so subscribers and comparing the results with another 100,000 who got, say, still images. (This is classic A/B testing, as it's known.) Every person present had something to say, but while there were strong disagreements, no one's feathers seemed ruffled. One of my last interviews at Netflix was with Tawni Cranz, the company's current chief talent officer, who started under Patty McCord in 2007. Five years later, McCord, her mentor, left. When I asked her why, she visibly flinched. She wouldn't explain, but I learned later that Hastings had let her go. It happened in 2011, after he made his biggest mistake as chief executive. He split Netflix into two companies — one to manage the DVD business and the other to focus on streaming. Customers were outraged; for many, the move meant a 60 percent price increase if they kept both the DVD and the streaming service. With complaints mounting and subscribers canceling, Hastings quickly reversed course and apologized. In the three weeks following this episode, the price of Netflix shares dropped 45 percent, and Wall Street questioned the company's acumen. Hastings decided to re-evaluate everyone in the executive ranks, using the litmus test McCord taught him: Would he hire them again today? One of the people this led him to push out was McCord. ""It made me sad,"" she said when I called to ask her about it. ""I had been working with Reed for 20 years."" Netflix had just given the go-ahead to ""House of Cards,"" and McCord said she ""didn't want to walk away in the middle of the next thing."" But she also felt a sense of pride. She was gratified that Hastings had taken her advice so thoroughly to heart. Bill Murray, wearing a tuxedo with no tie, stepped out of a black car and meandered through a throng of people toward Ted Sarandos. It was a crisp night in December, and Murray had just arrived at the New York premiere of ""A Very Murray Christmas,"" a loosely structured, thinly plotted musical-comedy special directed by Sofia Coppola and including guest appearances by George Clooney, Chris Rock, Michael Cera and others. In the fall of 2014, when Coppola and Murray first cooked up the idea, they went straight to Sarandos. By then, a year and a half after ""House of Cards"" became available, Netflix had a reputation for deep pockets, marketing savvy and a hands-off policy with the ""talent."" The idea of doing away with a pilot, born of desperation when Sarandos was wooing Fincher, had now become Netflix's standard practice, much to the delight of producers and directors. ""Ted,"" Murray said, as they shook hands warmly, ""you should get a promotion."" He grabbed Sarandos by the lapels, pulled him close and added loudly, ""You are the future!"" The two men laughed uproariously. From the time he arrived at Netflix in 2000, Sarandos has had the final say on both Netflix's licensing deals and its original programming. An Arizona native, Sarandos was working for a large video-retail chain when Hastings hired him to negotiate DVD deals directly with the studios. Sarandos had been in love with movies all his life: He worked his way through college by managing an independent video store. If he had chosen a different path, it's easy to imagine him having become a traditional Hollywood executive instead of an industry antagonist. When the networks complain about Netflix, Sarandos is the one who usually shoots back. Netflix doesn't publish ratings! Ratings, he says, are irrelevant to Netflix because the only number that matters is subscriber growth; Netflix doesn't need to aggregate viewers for advertisers, and it doesn't care when consumers watch their shows, whether it's the day they are released or two years later. Netflix spends too much money for its shows! ""Big Data helps us gauge potential audience size better than others,"" Sarandos told me. At an investment conference late last year, David Zaslav, the chief executive of Discovery Communications, which operates the Discovery Channel, articulated the case for having networks rethink their relationship with Netflix. Streaming video-on-demand platforms ""only exist because of our content,"" Zaslav said, in an obvious reference to Netflix. ""To the extent that our content doesn't exist on their platforms — not to be too pejorative — they are dumb pipes. We as an industry are supporting economic models that don't make sense."" Sarandos, who had spoken earlier in the day, had clearly anticipated the criticism: ""Zaslav says that we built a great business on their content,"" he said. ""That's just not true. We did not renew their deal when they wanted a premium. So we replaced it with other programming that got us just as many viewers for less money."" Those who think Netflix will come to dominate television have a simple rationale: Netflix has exposed, and taken advantage of, the limitations of conventional TV. The more time people spend on Netflix — it's now up to nearly two hours a day — the less they watch network television. ""Our thesis is that bingeing drives more bingeing,"" says Greenfield, the Wall Street analyst. ""Once people start watching shows that don't have commercials, they never want to go back. Waiting week after week for the next episode of a favorite show,"" he says, ""is not a good experience for consumers anymore."" Still, despite the rise in Netflix's share price over the past few years, the company has no shortage of doubters on Wall Street. Some distrust Netflix's numbers, arguing that millions of people no longer watch the service anymore but keep their subscriptions because they are so inexpensive. Netflix has announced that it will raise prices this year, and the Netflix skeptics believe the price increase will cause subscribers to cancel in droves. Other critics note the slowdown in the growth of domestic subscribers, by far the company's most profitable segment. In addition, Netflix, between its content costs and the cost of adding subscribers, is spending more than it collects in revenue. How long can that continue? Finally, the pessimists point out that Netflix makes very little profit: In the first quarter of this year, for instance, Netflix had nearly $2 billion in revenue but only $28 million in profit. Despite the significant moves by Netflix into original programming, Wall Street still values Netflix more like a platform company — a business that uses the internet to match buyers and sellers, like Uber — than a content company, like a studio or a network. Its valuation is currently $5 billion more than Sony, for example. Hastings, who has been very blunt about the company's strategy of plowing money back into the business, has promised bigger profits sometime in 2017. Whether he can deliver on that promise will be a significant test of investors' faith in him. One of the most prominent Netflix skeptics is Michael Pachter, a research analyst at Wedbush Securities, a Los Angeles-based investment bank. In his view, Netflix's true advantage in the beginning was that it had the entire game to itself, and the networks, not realizing how valuable streaming rights would be, practically gave them away. He had a ""buy"" on the stock from 2007 to 2010, he told me. But, he added, referring to those years when Netflix had streaming all to itself, ""If it's too good to be true, then it will attract competition."" Now, he said, the networks and studios are charging higher fees for their shows, forcing up Netflix's costs. Netflix doesn't own most of the shows that it buys or commissions, like ""House of Cards,"" so it has to pay more when it renews a popular show. In addition to the money it now spends on content, it also has more than $12 billion in future obligations for shows it has ordered. The only way it can pay for all of that is to continue adding subscribers and raise subscription rates. And even then, Pachter says, the networks will extract a piece of any extra revenue Netflix generates. ""It is naïve to think that Netflix can raise its price by $2 a month and keep all the upside,"" he said. ""I defy you to look at any form of content where the distributor raises prices and the supplier doesn't get more. That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. ""Netflix,"" Pachter concluded, ""is caught in an arms race they invented."" He compared Netflix to a rat racing on a wheel, staying ahead only by going faster and faster and spending more and more: As its costs continue to go up, it needs to constantly generate more subscribers to stay ahead of others. And if that doesn't happen? If subscriber growth were to stall, for instance, then Wall Street would stop treating it as a growth stock, and its price would start falling. Slower growth would also increase the cost of taking on more debt to pay for its shows. The company would be forced to either raise subscription prices even higher or cut back on those content costs or do both, which could slow subscriber growth even further. Netflix's virtuous circle — subscriber growth and content expenditures driving each other — would become a vicious circle instead. Five years from now, will the networks have taken the steps they need to prevent Netflix from dominating television? Will they have improved their technology, withdrawn most of their shows from Netflix or embraced streaming without sacrificing too much of their current profits? Or is Netflix in the process of ""disintermediating"" them, offering consumers such an improved viewing experience that the networks will instead be pushed to the sidelines? Matthew Ball, a strategist for Otter Media, who writes often about the future of television, thinks the latter is more likely. He says that today, when you have a cable subscription, you have access to hundreds of channels — in effect, they all share you as a customer. The cable bundle puts you in a television ecosystem, and you flip from one show to the other depending on what you want to watch. In the emerging on-demand world, television won't work that way: All the networks will have their own streaming service and customers will have to pay a fee for every one. The days when networks could make money from people who never watch their shows will end. One consequence is that networks will have to have one-on-one relationships with their viewers — something they have little experience with, and which Netflix, with its ability to ""personalize"" its interactions with its 81 million customers, has mastered. Another consequence is that as streaming becomes the primary way people watch television, they are highly unlikely to pay for more than a small handful of subscription-TV networks. What they will want, Ball believes, is a different setup: companies that offer far more programming than any one network can provide. Netflix, clearly, has already created that kind of ecosystem. ""Netflix is ABC, it is Discovery, it is AMC, it is USA and all the other networks,"" Ball said. ""Its subscribers don't say, 'I love Netflix for Westerns, but I'll go somewhere else for sci-fi.' The old model just doesn't work in an on-demand world."" In this vision of the future, Netflix's most potent competitor is likely to be Amazon, which is also developing an extensive array of content, including many of its own original shows. Early on, it, too, produced a highly praised series, ""Transparent."" It, too, has no allegiance to the cable bundle. And it has the kind of revenue — exceeding $100 billion — that neither the networks nor Netflix can approach. Compared to the networks, Netflix may have an imposing war chest, but in a fight with Amazon, it would be outgunned. According to Ball, what Netflix is counting on to maintain its primacy and to start making big profits is ""unprecedented scale."" That's where the effort to create a global network, the one that was announced in January at the Consumer Electronics Show, comes in. In April, when the company announced its first-quarter results, it said it had added 4.5 million international subscribers. Yet success, and profits, are still some way off, as Hastings is the first to acknowledge. YouTube, he notes, is available in more than 50 languages; Netflix can be seen in only 20 languages. Netflix was primarily attracting people in its new countries who speak English as it races to ""localize"" its service in each country. Netflix is ordering shows with an international flavor, like ""Narcos,"" but so far it has only a handful up and running. Netflix wants to make ""the best Bollywood movie that's ever been produced,"" Hastings told an Indian publication; it wants to make Japanese anime; it wants to make local films for every market; it wants global rights when it licenses shows — something that, once again, contravenes Hollywood's conventional business model, in which rights are sold on a country-by-country basis. The company still has much to learn about each country's quirks and tastes and customs, and it will be a while before it can hope to earn a profit from its global customers. To my surprise, Hastings spoke to me about the current moment as a ""period of stability."" It took me a while to understand what he meant, given how unstable the television industry seems to be right now. But Netflix has spent much of its existence zigging and zagging, responding to the pressures of the marketplace. ""When we were in the DVD business,"" Hastings said, ""it was hard to see how we would get to streaming."" Then it was hard to see how to go from a domestic company to a global one. And how to go from a company that licensed shows to one that had its own original shows. Now it knew exactly where it was going. ""Our challenges are execution challenges,"" he told me. Asked what the competitive landscape would look like five years in the future, he returned to the analogy he used earlier with the evolution of the telephone. Landlines had been losing out to mobile phones for the past 15 years, he said, but it had been a gradual process. The same, he believed, would be true of television. ""There won't be a dramatic tipping point,"" he said. ""What you will see is that the bundle gets used less and less."" For now, even as Hulu and Amazon were emerging as rivals, he claimed that the true competition was still for users' time: not just the time they spent watching cable but the time they spent reading books, attending concerts. And Hastings was aware that even after the bundle is vanquished, the disruption of his industry will be far from complete. ""Prospective threats?"" he mused when I asked him about all the competition. ""Movies and television could become like opera and novels, because there are so many other forms of entertainment. Someday, movies and TV shows will be historic relics. But that might not be for another 100 years."""
0,2016-06-17," Since 2013, Amazon has released a batch of original TV pilots several times a year for the public to review and vote on. Our TV critics look at a few from the latest crop. Based on the 2013 novel by Meg Wolitzer, ""The Interestings"" bounces between the teenage and adult years of a group of friends who meet at an arts summer camp and christen — or is it curse? — themselves ""the Interestings."" On the one hand, that youthful self-absorption allows some members to achieve extraordinary creative success. But on the other, pity the stunted grown-up still trying to live up to a teenager's idea of greatness. Lauren Ambrose (""Six Feet Under"") stars as Jules, who as an adult still feels like a lucky guest at the Interestings' party, even though she's as enmeshed as any of them. Jules is like many arch heroines, equal parts bombast and fragility, shaken and poured over ice, or in her case, poured over a husband (Gabriel Ebert) who is decidedly a Boring. Jessica Paré (""Mad Men"") and David Krumholtz (""Numbers"") also star as two other members of the clique who marry each other; she, the glamorous and theatrical Ash, and he the wildly successful cartoonist Figman. Adapting a novel for television means losing some of the precision of the characters' interior life. But this cast's chemistry and performances, particularly from Ms. Ambrose and Mr. Ebert, create a comparable specificity, demonstrating their own spin on the efficient loathing of a failing New York marriage. The pilot effectively conveys the various textures of the relationships among the old friends, which are sometimes fraught and sometimes the only source of peace in their lives. Must it be called ""interesting""? Well, O.K. then. MARGARET LYONS It's probably wrong to judge sea creatures based on a first impression, but, to be blunt, Sigmund is no Little Mermaid. Sigmund is the nonhuman star of ""Sigmund and the Sea Monsters,"" the remake of a 1970s children's show by Sid and Marty Krofft, and he more or less forces you to make the comparison to Ariel because, like her, he is fascinated by humans' gewgaws. ""You have all this cool stuff up here,"" he tells the children who free him from a fishing net. ""So much better than what we sea monsters have."" The storytelling isn't great, and neither are the three child actors (Solomon Stewart, Rebecca Bloom and Kyle Harrison Breitkopf) who are the focus of this show. Also not great: David Arquette, who plays Captain Barnabus, a gnarly old salt who tries in vain to convince other grown-ups that sea monsters are real. Presumably the intended audience here is 8 and younger, and maybe that age group won't care that this is thin stuff that seems indifferently made. NEIL GENZLINGER F. Scott Fitzgerald described Monroe Stahr, the Hollywood-producer protagonist of his unfinished novel ""The Last Tycoon,"" as one of ""not half a dozen men"" who could ""keep the whole equation of pictures in their heads."" In adaptation, written and directed by Billy Ray, Stahr is an upstanding guy who can charm a starlet and look good in a dinner jacket — he's one of thousands. Putting Fitzgerald on screen is a thankless business — his infinitely delicate realism withers in the light, and if you can't capture the texture of his prose, there's really no point. So Mr. Ray has taken Fitzgerald's last work — in which his love and hate for the movie business remain unresolved, while jostling for space with a death-obsessed romance — and reimagined it as a sprightly but lamentably pedestrian showbiz melodrama. Several plot lines that he's elevated or created with a series pickup in mind, involving Nazis and a Hooverville across from the studio lot, feel distinctly unpromising. Matt Bomer (""White Collar""), in and out of dinner jackets, looks great and projects an easy assurance as Stahr, but the character doesn't have the gravity of someone (like Irving Thalberg, the producer Fitzgerald modeled his hero on) who can make great art while keeping the whole Hollywood equation in his head. That Stahr would never have given this mundane production a green light. MIKE HALE"

And Pixar's visually entrancing ""The Good Dinosaur"" turns the creation story on its head. ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK on Netflix. Life at Litchfield Penitentiary turns especially ugly in Season 4, as privatization brings overcrowding and abusive guards while deepening racial chasms. Piper, meanwhile, anoints herself lord of the jungle as her soiled-panty enterprise flourishes.

0,2016-06-24," Opera fans live for the moments when a big-voiced singer fills a soaring melody with raw emotion and thrilling sound. But there's a limit: Daniel Catán's opera ""Florencia en el Amazonas"" (""Florencia in the Amazon"") is made up almost entirely of effusive melodic lines. That's certainly the way it came across on Wednesday at the Rose Theater at Jazz at Lincoln Center, where New York City Opera presented the New York premiere of ""Florencia,"" first heard in 1996 at the Houston Grand Opera. The overwrought lyricism and lack of musical subtlety kept turning the opera melodramatic, even maudlin. This current production, directed by John Hoomes, was originally presented at the Nashville Opera last year and is the latest offering from the resuscitated version of City Opera, which had gone under in 2013. The characters in ""Florencia,"" with a Spanish libretto by Marcelo Fuentes-Berain, are inspired by the writings of Gabriel García Márquez, though the opera is not based on any specific work of his. The story follows a group of South Americans on a steamboat journey down the Amazon to Manaus, the jungle city, where they believe Florencia Grimaldi, a world-famous, reclusive soprano, has agreed to sing. Among the group, it turns out, is Florencia, who is searching for a former lover, a butterfly hunter who shaped her young life 20 years earlier. The opera touches on potentially rich themes: that love can unleash creativity; that mutual devotion and personal freedom are not incompatible. The Mexican-born Mr. Catán, who died in 2011 at 62, brought sure skills as an orchestrator and colorist to his music. Here and there, passages of gritty harmonic intensity, brief eruptions of skittish instrumental lines, and other restless touches remind you that he earned a doctorate at Princeton under the serialist Milton Babbitt. Overall, though, his musical language is unabashedly neo-Romantic. In scene after scene, the characters break into seemingly inevitable, luxurious lyrical flights. Puccini is the model, though he was a more savvy dramatist who saved soaring melodies for crucial moments. The sounds of nature, from chirping jungle birds to the surging currents of the river, are effectively captured in Mr. Catán's orchestral writing, evocative of Debussy and Stravinsky. But the orchestra also swells with hokey cinematic outbursts. The story becomes sunk in heavy-handed symbolism when a storm sets the boat adrift and sets off a night of soul-searching for the characters. The conductor Dean Williamson drew colorful, shimmering playing from the City Opera orchestra. The cast was excellent, starting with the plush-toned, expressive soprano Elizabeth Caballero as Florencia. The soprano Sarah Beckham-Turner brought a warm voice and earnestness to Rosalba, a young journalist working on a biography of Grimaldi. Rosalba at first resists, but finally accepts, the love of Arcadio, the captain's nephew, here the ardent tenor Won Whi Choi. Lisa Chaves and Luis Ledesma threw themselves into several scenes as a long-married, frequently quarreling couple who rekindle their love during the crisis-ridden trip. Kevin Thompson made a sturdy captain. The production incorporates videos behind the action to convey the passing shore and flowing river. In a bold choice, the currents (and creatures) of the Amazon are suggested by a dozen dancers from Ballet Hispanico's BHdos company, wearing full white body suits and writhing on the floor at the front of the stage. One lame touch came when the strong bass-baritone Philip Cokorinos, playing Riolobo, the captain's mysterious helper, appeared in a mystical butterfly suit to calm the storm. If the idea was to conjure a magical realm, he just looked silly."
0,2016-06-27," Just ahead of the back-to-school season, Amazon plans to make a major foray into the education technology market for primary and secondary schools, a territory that Apple, Google and Microsoft have heavily staked out. Monday morning, Amazon said that it would introduce an online marketplace with tens of thousands of free lesson plans, worksheets and other instructional materials for teachers in late August or early September. Called Amazon Inspire, the education site has features that may seem familiar to frequent Amazon shoppers. Search bar at the top of the page? Check. User reviews? Check. Star ratings for each product? Check. By starting out with a free resources service for teachers, Amazon is establishing a foothold that could expand into a one-stop shopping marketplace — not just for paid learning materials, but for schools' wider academic and institutional software needs, said Tory Patterson, co-founder of Owl Ventures, a venture capital fund that invests in ed tech start-ups. ""Amazon is very clearly positioning itself as a disrupter with this move,"" Mr. Patterson said. Amazon is joining other tech industry giants in a push to expand the use of technology in the public schools. Last year, primary and secondary schools in the United States spent $4.9 billion on tablet, laptop and desktop computers, according to a report by Linn Huang, a research director at the International Data Corporation, a market research firm known as IDC. Schools bought 10.8 million Apple, Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows devices in 2015, he said. Because its devices tend to cost more, Apple accounted for the largest slice of school computer sales, amounting to $2.2 billion, Mr. Huang said. By volume, however, Chromebooks — the inexpensive laptops that run on Google's Chrome operating system — have taken schools by storm, accounting for more than five million devices bought last year, he said. Even so, ed tech industry analysts said the growing market for digital educational materials, which Amazon is entering, is likely to prove much more valuable over time than the school computer market. Already, nursery through high schools in the United States spend more than $8.3 billion annually on educational software and digital content, according to estimates from the Software and Information Industry Association, a trade group. That spending could grow significantly as school districts that now buy physical textbooks, assessment tests, professional development resources for teachers and administrative materials shift to digital systems. In a phone interview, Rohit Agarwal, general manager of Amazon K-12 Education, said the new site was intended to make it easier and faster for teachers to pinpoint timely and relevant free resources for their classrooms. ""Every teacher should be able to use the platform with zero training,"" Mr. Agarwal said. He added: ""We are taking a big step forward to help the educator community make the digital classroom a reality."" The site for teachers is not Amazon's first education venture. In 2013, the company acquired TenMarks, a math instruction site. (Mr. Patterson of Owl Ventures is also a partner at Catamount Ventures, a firm that was an investor in TenMarks.) In March, the New York City public schools, the largest school district in the country, awarded Amazon a three-year contract, worth an estimated $30 million, to provide e-books to its 1.1 million students. In the school market, however, Amazon is competing not just with rival tech companies but also with established digital education companies and ed tech start-ups. A number of popular platforms already offer instructional materials for teachers. Among them are tes.com, a site based in London with more than eight million users worldwide, and teacherspayteachers.com, a site based in Manhattan that more than two million teachers use regularly. Like Amazon Inspire, these sites let teachers search for materials by subject matter, like fractions or mitosis, and by grade level. Like Amazon Inspire, tes.com lets teachers download lessons and edit them to suit their students. (Some resources on teacherspayteachers.com may also be edited.) Mr. Agarwal said the company's new instructional resources site would be able to differentiate itself by being more intuitive for teachers who are Amazon users and by offering compelling new features. ""With the technology, content and expertise that Amazon has, we believed we could provide value,"" he said. Amazon timed its announcement to coincide with ISTE, the annual conference of the International Society for Technology in Education, which about 16,000 teachers and school officials are attending in Denver this week. Other tech giants also unveiled new education ventures during the conference. On Sunday, Microsoft said that it was working with ISTE to help schools introduce and integrate technology in the classroom. The project includes training programs for school administrators, online leadership courses developed with edX — a learning platform created by Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — and services to support schools as they adopt digital learning approaches. On Monday, Google said it was making Expeditions, a free virtual reality app for students that has been available on a limited basis to schools, generally available. More than one million students tried the app during its test phase, the company said. Google also introduced two new products for schools: Quizzes, an online form that teachers can use to give tests and automatically grade multiple-choice questions, and Cast for Education, a free Chrome app intended to promote class discussion by enabling teachers and students to share what is on their screens with one another."
1,2016-06-27," For years, Apple and Dell battled over sales to students and schools. Apple was arguably the first tech company to make significant sales to the education market (not including those IBM and Hewlett-Packard mainframes used in engineering departments), thanks to computers that were far easier to use than early Windows PCs. But as Apple stumbled in the 1990s and Windows improved, Dell's Windows PCs grabbed a significant share. Now those old rivals have plenty of company. This week, at an education conference in Colorado, executives from Amazon, Google, Microsoft and other tech companies will be discussing what they bring to the educational market, from software and online tools to devices like the Mac or Google's Chromebooks. A cynic would say they want to get them hooked while they're young. And there might be some truth to that: Get comfortable with a Mac or a Chromebook when you're young and you'll probably use it for years to come. But education is also a significant business opportunity. Last year, primary and secondary schools in the United States spent $4.9 billion on tablet, laptop and desktop computers, according to researchers at IDC."
0,2016-06-28," PARIS — The bioacoustician and musician Bernie Krause has been recording soundscapes of the natural world since 1968, from coral reefs to elephant stamping grounds to the Amazonian rain forest. Now, Mr. Krause's recordings have become part of an immersive new exhibition at the Cartier Foundation here called ""The Great Animal Orchestra."" Named after Mr. Krause's 2012 book of the same title, the show opens on Saturday and runs through Jan. 8. At its heart is a work by the London-based collective United Visual Artists, who have transformed Mr. Krause's recordings of the natural world into 3-D renderings. Imagine stepping into a soundproofed black-box theater whose walls spring to life with what look like overlapping electrocardiograms, representing different species' sounds. ""It's way cool,"" Mr. Krause, 77, said last week, opening his laptop to show the sounds and spectrographs on which United Visual Artists based the sound-and-light installation. Higher-pitched sounds, from animals like bats and insects, appeared at the top of the screen, then below them frogs and other amphibians, and finally lower-pitched mammals toward the bottom, each with a distinctive yawp. The installation includes recordings Mr. Krause made in Algonquin Park in Ontario, where he found himself caught between two packs of wolves; in the Yukon Delta, a subarctic area in Alaska, where birds from different continents converge; and in the Central African Republic, where he heard monkeys. He also captured the cacophony of the Amazon, and whales off Alaska and Hawaii. ""They're very jazzlike, actually,"" he said of the whales. But the animal calls also carry a message. Mr. Krause estimates that of the sounds in his vast archive — more than 5,000 hours of recordings from 2,000 habitats encompassing some 15,000 species — 50 percent come from habitats that no longer exist. ""A lot of these habitats in this exhibit are in danger,"" he said. In the forest where he recorded in the Central African Republic, ""all the elephants are gone now,"" he said. ""Wolves in North America are always under great stress,"" he added. ""In the Yukon Delta, with the birds, the tundra is melting, and global warming is beginning to take over."" Mr. Krause is a polymathic musician who performed with the folk group the Weavers and helped introduce the Moog synthesizer to pop music — including songs by the Doors and Van Morrison — and film scores. He hears natural sounds with a studio producer's ear and is dismissive of scientists who focus on only one species at a time. Singling out one bird in a habitat is ""like trying to understand the magnificence of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony by abstracting the sound of a single violin player out of the orchestra and hearing just that one part,"" he said. ""You've got to hear the whole thing."" In 2014, at the Cheltenham Festival in England, Mr. Krause and the composer Richard Blackford presented the debut of a symphony composed for orchestra and Mr. Krause's recordings from the natural world. Last year, that music was used for ""Biophony,"" a ballet performed at Jacob's Pillow. The Paris exhibition, curated by Hervé Chandès, the general director of the Cartier Foundation, is the most extensive visual response to Mr. Krause's work yet. For the show, the foundation commissioned an original work by the New York-based Chinese artist Cai Guo-Qiang, who works with gunpowder on paper. Mr. Cai made a 60-foot-long mural of horses at a watering hole by lighting the gunpowder until the images were burned into the paper. ""It's so amazing to me,"" Mr. Krause said. ""It looks like the caves at Lascaux."" There are also black-and-white photographs of dioramas at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, taken by Hiroshi Sugimoto, and photographs of birds by the Japanese photographer Manabu Miyazaki, who uses robotic cameras. Mr. Krause, who lives in Northern California, began to study bioacoustics after working on the soundtrack to the 1979 film ""Apocalypse Now."" Like many involved with that movie, he said he was hired and fired by the director, Francis Ford Coppola, multiple times. ""A lot of people were kind of destroyed by that process,"" Mr. Krause said. ""I got tired of that whole Hollywood scene and I decided I didn't want to do it anymore."" He also finds the natural world therapeutic. ""I have a terrible case of A.D.H.D.,"" Mr. Krause said. ""Forget medication, forget therapy — the only thing that works for me is going out into a field and putting on a pair of earphones and listening to natural sound."""
1,2016-06-28," SEATTLE — For years, Amazon has been chiseling away at the irritants that keep many people from switching to e-readers. The company has improved the legibility of the text on Kindle screens to make it nearly indistinguishable from print, and fiddled with the ergonomics of the new Kindle Oasis to make using it feel more like holding a book. On Tuesday, Amazon will make a small change to its Kindle software that could solve a vexing issue for people who prefer the intuitiveness of navigating a print book. The update to the software for Amazon's own Kindle devices as well as apps that run on iOS and Android will include a feature called Page Flip that effectively mimics the near-universal habit of using a thumb to temporarily mark the page of a printed book where the reader left off. The update will be available free on Tuesday. Page Flip is designed for those moments when you're reading and need to quickly glance at another section of a book with photographs, maps or family trees. This is especially useful for nonfiction, but also comes in handy for books like ""A Game of Thrones"" that feature large casts of characters who inhabit a bewildering array of fictional lands. In a recent demonstration of Page Flip, Jeff Kunins, vice president for Kindle Reader at Amazon, says the company regularly surveys people with Kindle devices and software to find out how to improve them. Readers of nonfiction have been clear about where they'd like to see changes. ""The No. 1 thing they've been telling us to get better at is navigation,"" Mr. Kunins said. In the past, someone using a Kindle device or app who wanted to save their place could bookmark a page, which works well enough but can get disorienting if you have digitally dog-eared a lot of pages. With Page Flip, Kindle automatically saves the page you're reading when you tap the screen of your device, pinning it to the side of the screen. You can also easily shift the book to what Amazon calls a bird's-eye view, which shows thumbnail images of a handful of pages at once so you can skim quickly to find the reference page you're looking for. Here's an Amazon promotional video of how it will work: There has been much chatter in the publishing industry about slowing e-book sales and the unexpected vitality of print book sales. Amazon is notoriously stingy with data about many of its businesses, but it is eager to convey that the Kindle business is still growing. Mr. Kunins said that 2015 was a record year for the Kindle business at Amazon; customers bought more Kindle books and read more of their pages than ever before. He said the company had paid more than $160 million in royalties over the last 12 months to independent authors who participated in Kindle Unlimited, a $10-a-month digital reading service (the company didn't provide comparable data for the year before). ""Kindle keeps growing year after year,"" he said."
0,2016-06-29," DENVER — File this under how not to roll out a high-profile digital education platform. One day after Amazon announced that it would introduce Amazon Inspire, a free instructional resources site where teachers could share lesson plans, the company said it had removed three items from the site after educators complained that the products were copyrighted materials. In a related blunder, Amazon had included two of the items it has since taken down in a screen shot of the site that was sent to journalists and published in news outlets, including The New York Times. More embarrassing still: Two items — a collection of first-grade math lessons and English literature activity lessons — in the Amazon screen shot were created by authors on teacherspayteachers.com, a rival instructional resources site where educators offer lesson plans they have created. Although the complaints about the Amazon site have been few, the copyright issue that emerged on Tuesday suggested that Amazon Inspire did not have an effective procedure to independently vet the copyright status of materials that teachers uploaded and shared. By contrast, established sites like YouTube have sophisticated processes to monitor user-generated content. Rohit Agarwal, the general manager of Amazon K-12 Education, the company's education unit, said the company was looking into how the materials in question came to be uploaded on the site. ""Our team is doubling down and investigating what the root cause is,"" Mr. Agarwal said in an interview on Tuesday evening at the annual conference of the International Society for Technology in Education, attended by about 16,000 educators in Denver. ""We will do what is appropriate to respond to the results of the investigation."" Amazon Inspire is a major step by the company to gain market share in an education tech landscape where rivals like Apple, Google and Microsoft have already established footholds. Mr. Agarwal said the site, which had been available to a limited number of teachers and school districts during the beta test phase, was scheduled to go live at the start of the school year this fall. But Amazon Inspire's early stumble has raised some concerns among educators, its intended audience. Amazon designed the site to enable teachers to post and freely share lesson plans, quizzes and curriculums of their own design, as well as open educational resources created by others. Mr. Agarwal said that users were not supposed to upload copyrighted materials and that the site had a process in place to quickly take down items that were the subjects of such complaints. But it may be more difficult than Amazon executives realized for the site's users to distinguish between open educational resources and copyrighted works. ""Even with all the safeguards in place, you have the ability to have someone upload a resource that violates a copyright,"" Mr. Agarwal conceded. More complaints may be in the works. On Tuesday night, a reader emailed me a screen shot indicating that Amazon Inspire also offered resources by one of the best-selling authors on teacherspayteachers.com, a site with more than two million active users. ""It takes tremendous work to create engaging and rigorous educational resources,"" said Adam Freed, the chief executive of Teacher Synergy, the company behind teacherspayteachers.com. ""So we understand the concerns from our TeachersPayTeachers community."""
0,2016-06-30," You still love television. You use your tablet more than ever. And now you are as likely to have paid services like Netflix or Amazon Prime as you are to have a DVR service. Those are some of the findings of a study released this week by Nielsen that measured how we are consuming media these days (increasingly on devices we hold in our hands), and how much live TV we still watch (an average of more than five hours a day). The study comes just a few weeks after Netflix revealed some data about how quickly people will take to finish a season of a TV show — about five days, give or take, spending two hours a day watching. How much are we watching, and how are we watching it? Here is what Nielsen found: On average, American adults are watching five hours and four minutes of television per day. The bulk of that — about four and a half hours of it — is live television, which is television watched when originally broadcast. Thirty minutes more comes via DVR. So even though ratings are falling and the broadcast networks don't quite have the glamour they used to, TV is alive and well, right? Well. That five-hour figure is 19 fewer minutes, on average, than Americans were watching two years ago — and three fewer than they watched per day last year. You're watching less TV live, but the rate of decline slowed between last year and this year. Let's break this into groups. People over the age of 50 watch the most TV, somewhere in the range of 50 hours a week, according to Nielsen. In fact, people over the age of 50 are watching more TV per week this year than last. But that's where that trend ends. People 24 and under are watching, roughly, two fewer hours of live TV and DVR programming per week than last year. And 25- to 34-year-olds (roughly speaking, millennials)? They're watching an hour less per week, down from 27 and a half hours to 26 and a half hours. People between 35 and 49 mostly held steady and are watching about 22 minutes less television per week: 36 and a half hours from nearly 37 hours a week. About 50 percent of Americans now have subscription services like Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu in their homes, Nielsen said. That is up from 42 percent last year. And that figure of 50 percent for the paid services equals for the first time the proportion of homes with DVR players. The DVR numbers have held steady for the past year. Tablets are now in 58 percent of American homes, a jump of 17 percent from last year (for comparison, HD TVs are in 94 percent of American homes, an increase of about 4 percent). And time spent consuming media on tablets has increased 63 percent — to 31 minutes from 19 minutes a day (in 2014, the average was 12 minutes a day). Likewise, people are spending one hour and 39 minutes a day consuming media on their phones this year, versus an hour and two minutes last year — a 60 percent jump. The amount of time you spend consuming media — watching TV, surfing the web on a computer, using an app on your phone, listening to the radio and so forth — continues to go up. Nielsen said that in 2015, Americans spent about nine and a half hours each day consuming content this way. This year? The average is 10 hours and 39 minutes. Still plenty of time to sleep, if not read a book."
0,2016-07-01," In the increasingly competitive space of children's television, Amazon Prime reached a deal to become the exclusive premium streaming service for most of PBS's shows for children, the company said on Friday. The deal means that much of PBS Kids programming — including shows like ""Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood,"" ""Wild Kratts"" and ""Odd Squad"" — will be removed from rival streaming sites like Netflix and Hulu, and will be available only on Amazon Prime. The shows became available on Friday. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. For Amazon, it is the latest move in a battle among the streaming giants, along with HBO, to acquire or create as many children's television shows as possible. Last year, HBO acquired the rights to broadcast first-run episodes of ""Sesame Street,"" and by the end of this year Netflix will have 35 original series for children. As children's viewing habits have changed, content providers have ferociously competed in this arena in an attempt to lure parents into buying subscriptions for their online services. According to a study released by Nielsen this week, children between the ages of 2 and 11 watched two fewer hours of live television per week this year compared with last year, as the amount of time they spent watching digital platforms jumped. All of the titles moving to Amazon will still be broadcast on local PBS stations, on PBS's website and the PBS Kids Video app. Amazon Prime will have the streaming rights to shows approximately six months after their premiere date on PBS stations. The Amazon-PBS deal means that Netflix will lose streaming rights to a dozen PBS shows, and Hulu will lose six shows. Netflix had previously streamed shows like ""Caillou,"" ""Reading Rainbow,"" ""Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood"" and ""Zoboomafoo,"" and Hulu will lose the rights to shows like ""Wild Kratts"" and ""Arthur."" Many of PBS's titles were previously available on both of those services, as well as Amazon. In a statement, Amazon's vice president of television acquisition, Brad Beale, said that the company was ""committed to making Prime Video the best destination for kids and family programming that will both educate and entertain."" Lesli Rotenberg, PBS's general manager of children's programming, said the broadcaster was ""very pleased to be continuing our relationship with Amazon."" A few titles are not covered by the deal: ""Super Why!"" will remain on Netflix; ""Sesame Street"" is broadcast on HBO and streams at HBO Go and HBO Now; ""Curious George"" is exclusive to Hulu; and ""Thomas and Friends"" will remain available on Amazon, Netflix and Hulu. PBS is also in the process of creating a free 24-hour TV channel for its children's programming, which is expected to debut early next year."
0,2016-07-03," SAN FRANCISCO — In a major shift for online commerce, Amazon is quietly changing how it entices people to buy. The retailer built a reputation and hit $100 billion in annual revenue by offering deals. The first thing a potential customer saw was a bargain: how much an item was reduced from its list price. Now, in many cases, Amazon has dropped any mention of a list price. There is just one price. Take it or leave it. The new approach comes as discounts both online and offline have become the subject of dozens of consumer lawsuits for being much less than they seem. It is also occurring while Amazon is in the middle of an ambitious multiyear shift from a store selling one product at a time to a full-fledged ecosystem. Amazon wants to be so deeply embedded in a customer's life that buying happens as naturally as breathing, and nearly as often. ""When Amazon began 21 years ago, the strategy was to lose on every sale but make it up on volume,"" said Larry Compeau, a Clarkson University professor of consumer studies. ""It was building for the future, and the future has arrived. Amazon doesn't have to seduce customers with a deal because they're going to buy anyway."" Or so Amazon hopes. Digital stores live by Alec Baldwin's maxim in ""Glengarry Glen Ross"": ""Always be closing."" The retailer has been experimenting with another method of closing a sale. It tells the potential buyer what the price used to be on Amazon. For example, Amazon originally promoted the Rave Turbo Chute as being discounted by 36 percent. Then, all mention of a discount was dropped and the 60-foot water slide was simply listed at $1,573.58, with an explanation that it used to be $1,573.59 — one penny more. Then, it dropped the old/new price comparison. Then, it dropped the price to $1,532.01 and put the comparison back. ""They still need to showcase deals, but the question is, How?"" said Michael Kovarik, who runs a comparison-pricing start-up called Rout. That is why stores love big discounts: they work. In studies by Mr. Compeau and others, the perception of a deal is often what makes the purchase happen. ""We've been conditioned to buy only when things are on sale,"" said Bonnie Patten, executive director of TruthInAdvertising.org, a consumer information site. ""As a result, what many retailers have done is make sure everything is always on sale. Which means nothing is ever on sale."" Amazon has both benefited from that conditioning as well as encouraged it, which is most likely why it is changing cautiously. It began eliminating list prices about two months ago, pricing specialists say, both on products it sold itself and those sold by other merchants on its site. The retailer did not return multiple requests for comment. ""Our data suggests that list prices are going away,"" said Guru Hariharan, chief executive of Boomerang Commerce, a retail analytics firm. Last spring, Boomerang compiled a list for The New York Times of 100 pet food products that Amazon said it was selling at a discount to a list price. Only about half of them still say that. ""Amazon is a data-driven company with very few sacred cows,"" Mr. Hariharan said. ""At the very least, it is conducting a storewide test about whether it should change its pricing strategy."" With a majority of Amazon products, the presentation of a bargain used to be front and center. Take, for example, the Breville Infuser Espresso Machine. A few months ago, Amazon said this was an $800 machine that it was offering for $500, a discount of 38 percent. Two articles in The Times earlier this year on the problems with online list prices drew on a randomly assembled list of 47 discounted housewares, leisure and other products on Amazon, including the Breville Infuser. Over the Fourth of July weekend, the list price was gone for 39 of those products. The Infuser page, for instance, simply said what it would cost to buy at that moment, which was $483. Nineteen of the product pages tried to encourage a sale by pointing out that the price used to be higher on Amazon, although no time period was given. ""Amazon is showing it can fix the problem if it wants to,"" Ms. Patten said. The problem with list prices or, as they are sometimes called, manufacturers' suggested retail prices, is that they are regularly more of a marketing concept than what anyone is actually charging. When Amazon was saying the list price of the Breville Infuser was $800, Breville itself was selling the machine for $500 — about the same as Amazon. Other retailers sell it for $500, too. Breville confirmed the price was $500. Bargains online and offline that are not real bargains are breeding legal action, much of it using a tough California law against deceptive advertising. New cases have been filed in the last few months against Macy's, J. Crew, Gymboree, Ann Taylor, Ralph Lauren and the website Wines 'Til Sold Out, according to TruthInAdvertising.org. Twenty-four cases were filed in the first six months of 2016, nearly as many as the 25 in all of 2015. There have been at least 10 settlements. In April, a Los Angeles judge gave preliminary approval to a $6 million offer by Kohl's Department Stores. That deal came on the heels of a $50 million preliminary settlement by J. C. Penney. Amazon itself was the target of a fake-discounts suit — an unexpected development, because all Amazon customers agree to go to arbitration instead of court. A judge dismissed the complaint but the plaintiffs are now appealing, saying the arbitration clause is ""unconscionable"" and should be invalidated. Amazon declined to comment on the suit. The shift away from list prices is taking some merchants on Amazon by surprise. A seller named Travis complained in an Amazon forum that the list price on his product — which he did not identify — had disappeared from the site. ""I'm well aware that it is bogus but it is a common marketing tactic that works very well at boosting sales,"" he wrote. Amazon also appears to have stepped up its monitoring of a vendor system that allowed some sellers to insert data that listed their products as 99 percent or even 100 percent off. Another Amazon seller who complained that his list prices were not showing up said he was told by the retailer that it was routinely checking list prices on other sites. Mr. Kovarik of Rout said his analysis indicated that Amazon was regularly eliminating more list prices. ""In early May, about 29 percent of the products we saw were missing list prices, but now the number is up to about 70 percent,"" he said. Amazon has always focused on driving revenue while disregarding profits. That had many implications: It was driven to try new things; it could undercut any competitor who focused on price; it could literally buy customer loyalty. In Amazon's third decade, with its complete domination of the e-commerce landscape, there are signs it is beginning to emphasize the value each customer brings. ""They are trying to figure out what product categories have customers who are so tied into the Amazon ecosystem that list prices are no longer necessary,"" Mr. Compeau, of Clarkson, said. In some categories, like groceries, Amazon seems to be using just one price, the buy-it-now price. If Amazon brings the milk and music into your house, not to mention videos and e-books and the devices to consume them on, as well as a hot dinner and just about any other object you could want, that presents a pricing challenge of a different sort. Untangling what those deals are worth — as opposed to what they cost — is probably impossible. ""Twenty years ago, we were hesitant to trust online companies with our credit card information,"" Mr. Compeau observed. ""Now we're being asked to trust them completely."""

But, as with most 19th-century novels, this is about so much more. Reviewing the film in The Times, Vincent Canby wrote that while it could easily be described as a comedy of manners, ""that doesn't do justice to what Mr. Kubrick has attempted, which is coolly to examine a world as strange and distant in its way as were the future worlds of '2001' and 'A Clockwork Orange.'""

Reviewing ""Volume 1"" in The Times, A. O. Scott wrote, ""Mr. Tarantino is an irrepressible show-off, recklessly flaunting his formal skills as a choreographer of high-concept violence, but he is also an unabashed cinephile, and the sincerity of his enthusiasm gives this messy, uneven spectacle an odd, feverish integrity."""

0,2016-07-05," RIO DE JANEIRO — The assailant struck as Gabriel Figueira Lima, 21, stood on a street two weeks ago in a city in the Amazon, plunging a knife into his neck and speeding off on the back of a motorcycle, leaving him to die. A few days earlier, in the coastal state of Bahia, two beloved teachers, Edivaldo Silva de Oliveira and Jeovan Bandeira, were killed as well, their charred remains found in the trunk of a burning car. Late last month, it was Wellington Júlio de Castro Mendonça, a shy, 24-year-old retail clerk, who was bludgeoned and stoned to death near a highway in a city northwest of Rio. In a nation seemingly inured to crime, the brutal killings stood out: The victims were not robbed, the police have yet to identify any suspects, and all of the dead were either gay or transgender. While Americans have fiercely debated how to respond to the massacre last month at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., Brazilians have been confronting their own epidemic of anti-gay violence — one that, by some counts, has earned Brazil the ignominious ranking of the world's deadliest place for lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people. Nearly 1,600 people have died in hate-motivated attacks in the past four and half years, according to Grupo Gay da Bahia, which tracks the deaths through news articles. By its tally, a gay or transgender person is killed almost every day in this nation of 200 million. ""And these numbers represent only the tip of the iceberg of violence and bloodshed,"" said Eduardo Michels, the group's data manager, adding that the Brazilian police often omit anti-gay animus when compiling homicide reports. Such statistics can be hard to square with Brazil's storied image as a tolerant, open society — a nation that seemingly nurtures freewheeling expressions of sexuality during Carnival and holds the world's biggest gay pride parade in the city of São Paulo. Here in Rio de Janeiro, host to the coming Summer Olympics, fear of violent crime is on many people's minds. Amid a crushing recession and soaring unemployment, street crime is up 24 percent this year and homicides have increased by more than 15 percent. At the same time, human rights activists say members of the Rio police force, eager to clean up the city ahead of the Aug. 5 opening ceremony for the Games, have shot dead more than 100 people this year, most of them young black men living in poor neighborhoods. But advocates say the constant homophobic violence also threatens to upend an idealized national ethos that promises equality and respect for all Brazilians. ""We live off this image as an open and tolerant place,"" said Jandira Queiroz, the mobilization coordinator at Amnesty International Brazil. ""Homophobic violence has hit crisis levels, and it's getting worse."" Brazil's near-mythic reputation for tolerance is not without justification. In the nearly three decades since democracy replaced military dictatorship, the Brazilian government has introduced numerous laws and policies aimed at improving the lives of sexual minorities. In 1996, it was among the first to offer free antiretroviral drugs to people with H.I.V. In 2003, Brazil became the first country in Latin America to recognize same-sex unions for immigration purposes, and it was among the earliest to allow gay couples to adopt children. In 2013, the Brazilian judiciary  effectively legalized same-sex marriage. Some experts suggest that liberal government policies may have gotten too far ahead of traditional social mores. The anti-gay violence, they contend, can be traced to Brazil's culture of machismo and a brand of evangelical Christianity, exported from the United States, that is outspoken in its opposition to homosexuality. Evangelicals make up nearly a quarter of Brazil's population, up from 5 percent in 1970, and religious leaders reach millions of people through the hundreds of television and radio stations they have purchased in recent years. American-style Pentecostal congregations are also playing an increasingly muscular role in Brazilian politics. Evangelical voters have helped send more than 60 lawmakers to the 513-member lower house of Congress, doubling their numbers since 2010 and making them one of the most disciplined blocs in an unruly and divided legislature. Jean Wyllys, Brazil's only openly gay member of Congress, said evangelical lawmakers, the core of a coalition known as the ""B.B.B. caucus"" — short for Bullets, Beef and Bible — have stymied legislation that would punish anti-gay discrimination and increase penalties for hate crimes. ""Evangelicals are getting increasingly powerful and have taken over Congress,"" Mr. Wyllys said. Eduardo Cunha, an evangelical Christian radio commentator who served as president of the lower house, once suggested that Congress establish a Heterosexual Pride Day. After a Brazilian soap opera featured a gay kiss, he broadcast his revulsion on Twitter. (Mr. Cunha, who faces allegations that he took $40 million in bribes, was ordered to step down in May.) During a televised presidential debate in 2014, one of the candidates, Levy Fidelix, said that homosexuals were unfit to be parents and that ""excretory systems aren't for reproduction."" Jair Bolsonaro, a congressman well known for his conservative views, has recommended corporal punishment as a tool for turning gays into heterosexuals. Javier Corrales, a political scientist at Amherst College who studies gay rights movements in Latin America, said much of the homophobia was a reaction to achievements like same-sex marriage. ""Brazilians are becoming more tolerant,"" he said, ""but the countertrend is that those who remain intolerant and opposed to L.G.B.T. rights are developing new strategies and a more virulent discourse to block progress on those issues."" Marco Feliciano, a prominent member of the evangelical bloc in Congress, rejects suggestions that anti-gay sentiment fosters violence. In an interview, he expressed regret for an earlier remark describing AIDS as ""a gay cancer,"" but defended efforts to fight gay rights legislation, insisting, for example, that same-sex couples are unfit to be parents. ""They put civilization and traditional families at risk of destruction,"" he said. Conservative politicians have resisted efforts to teach tolerance in schools, and the police have shown little interest in adopting training programs to help rank-and-file officers tackle bias crimes. Victims of anti-gay and transgender violence say they often experience a fresh round of humiliation from the law enforcement authorities, some of whom are openly hostile to requests that they record a crime as bias-motivated. Dudu Quintanilha, 28, an artist and photographer from São Paulo, said he had been beaten with a stick by four assailants during Carnival this year. The attackers, who set upon him in the heart of downtown, shouted anti-gay epithets as they bloodied his face, he said, but the police refused to consider the attack an act of homophobia. Over several hours, he said, officers at a police station insisted that he had been the victim of a simple robbery because he lost his cellphone and wallet during the chaos. ""In the end, they made me doubt whether a homophobic attack really happened,"" he said. ""They made me doubt if I was in my right mind."" Antonio Kvalo, 34, a web designer, created temlocal.com.br, a site where Brazilians can log instances of anti-gay violence. He said he had been motivated in part by his own experience, in 2008, when two men tackled him on a street in Rio and kicked him dozens of times. When the police arrived, they repeatedly questioned his account and, after he insisted that they record the attack as a hate crime, told him to drape himself over the trunk of their vehicle and assume the pose of a suspect. ""They made me feel like I was a criminal,"" he said. Activists say transgender Brazilians face the greatest brutality, with many murder victims badly mutilated. Last year, a group of men videotaped their assault on Piu da Silva, 25, an ebullient samba dancer in Rio, who was tortured and forced to beg for her life before being stabbed and shot six times. The assailants, who posted the attack on Facebook, were not found. ""Transsexuals live with constant fear,"" Mr. Kvalo said. Even when suspects in homophobic violence are arrested, advocates say, they are often treated leniently. The two men who savagely beat André Baliera, a 28-year-old law student, in an upscale neighborhood of São Paulo were originally charged with attempted murder. Last year, after serving a two-month sentence, the men were ordered to pay a $6,300 fine and released. The fear is palpable for Gilson Borges Reis, 18, a student in Lauro de Freitas, an industrial city in northeast Brazil. Last month, a cousin who had long taunted him for being gay chased him down the street with a kitchen knife, stabbing him in the chest and arms as relatives watched in horror. Mr. Reis survived, and the cousin, an evangelical Christian, was arrested. He has been charged with attempted murder, but was promptly released on bail. The two cousins live on the same street. ""He passes my house and flashes me an awful expression,"" Mr. Reis said through tears. ""I have no protection. I am afraid."""
0,2016-07-07," Amazon hopes to persuade people to pay for something they have traditionally enjoyed free: short-form audio. Audible, Amazon's audiobook and spoken-word subsidiary, on Thursday announced Channels, a subscription service that will offer a new library of audio, including original programs, articles read aloud and more. At $4.95 a month, it presents a lower-priced entry point to the service and significantly expands on Audible's core audiobook offering, while giving listeners more incentive to stick with the company. Channels will be free under Audible's traditional $14.95 monthly membership, which provides access to hundreds of thousands of programs and audiobooks. ""It's pretty obvious there's an audience for it, to us at least,"" said Eric Nuzum, who leads the Channels team and is a former vice president at National Public Radio. Roughly two out of five Audible customers listen to podcasts, he said. But those customers are not always satisfied with what they find. ""When you talk to those customers and you ask them about podcasting, they describe something that equally enthralls them and frustrates them,"" he said. In that frustration, Audible sees an opportunity. Similar programs, in the form of podcasts — a label Audible resists as too narrow — have traditionally been free, supported by advertising, sponsorships, user donations or support from media and radio organizations. That a subsidiary of a company as aggressive as Amazon would invest in such a service suggests that it anticipates a willingness among the public to pay for short-form audio. Subscribers to Channels will have access to programs such as comedy acts, renditions of short stories, nonfiction accounts, talk shows, newspaper articles and more. (The New York Times is among Audible's partners.) The service will also include several episodes of the original program ""Presidents Are People Too,"" which explores the private lives of the nation's commanders in chief. Users will be able to preview other forthcoming original shows, too. ""Breasts Unbound"" will examine the history of those often-fetishized body parts. In ""Mortal City,"" the host and former crime reporter Kathleen Horan will interview people living on society's fringes. Authors will share a variety of firsts in ""Authorized."" A series of interconnected events and stories will be explored over 10 episodes in ""The Butterfly Effect."" And ""Damned Spot"" will document stories of places forever changed by murders, hangings, hauntings and other unfortunate events."
0,2016-07-10," REDMOND, Wash. — Just off a remote stretch of road here, near wineries, horse stables and farms, Amazon is secretly growing something, but it's not what Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, calls the ""tiny seeds"" that could become the company's next big businesses. No, Amazon is growing actual plants, more than 3,000 species of them spread around a one-acre greenhouse a half-hour's drive from Amazon's headquarters in Seattle. There are carnivorous pitcher plants, exotic philodendrons and orchids from Ecuador that resemble the menacing flora from ""Little Shop of Horrors."" ""Cinnamon, wax candy and baby powder,"" said Ron Gagliardo, the Amazon horticulturist who oversees the greenhouse, when asked to describe the mysterious scent of the orchid, called Anguloa virginalis. Amazon pioneered internet shopping, electronic book reading and cloud computing. Now, as it enters adulthood, it is applying some of that inventiveness to its new home. The company is constructing a collection of high-rise and low-rise buildings in downtown Seattle that will be arrayed around three striking transparent, conjoined structures that Amazon calls spheres. They will act as high-tech greenhouses, the kind of flashy architecture that Amazon shunned for the first 22 years of its life. ""We wanted it to be iconic, a structure that would be similar to another icon in the city, like the Space Needle, for newcomers to Seattle,"" said John Schoettler, director of Amazon's global real estate and facilities. ""It would be a found treasure in the downtown neighborhood."" The real point of the spheres is how Amazon wants to use the nature on the inside to inspire employees. When they open in early 2018, the spheres will be packed with a plant collection worthy of top-notch conservatories, allowing Amazon employees to amble through tree canopies three stories off the ground, meet with colleagues in rooms with walls made from vines and eat kale Caesar salads next to an indoor creek. Since Amazon decided about a decade ago to stay in downtown Seattle, the company said, it has invested over $4 billion in the construction and development of offices in the city, though it won't disclose the budget for the spheres. The spheres will be accessible to Amazon employees only, but the company may eventually allow public tours. ""The whole idea was to get people to think more creatively, maybe come up with a new idea they wouldn't have if they were just in their office,"" said Dale Alberda, the lead architect on the project at NBBJ, a firm that has also worked on building projects for Samsung, Google and the Chinese internet company Tencent. Tech companies have been eager to test ways to make workplaces more conducive to creativity. Some turn their offices into grown-up playgrounds, with beanbag chairs, ball pits and Ping-Pong tables. The more refined alternative now catching on is to make nature the star of the show. Apple, for example, has hired an arborist, Dave Muffly, to oversee the planting of about 8,000 trees on its new 176-acre campus in Cupertino, Calif., which will surround a spaceship-shaped new building where Apple employees will work. The mostly native trees are intended to restore the natural landscape that once blanketed Silicon Valley. What makes Amazon's project unusual is its location — in the heart of a city, rather than on a sprawling suburban campus of the sort favored by most other big tech companies. Amazon, the largest private employer in Seattle, has more than 20,000 employees spread out in more than 30 buildings in the city. Its current construction plans will give it the space to more than double its local head count. Mr. Bezos has said that Amazon is staying put in a city because the kinds of employees it wants are attracted to an urban environment. But the concrete and steel canyons around Amazon's new downtown properties do not have a lot of greenery. That is where the spheres and Mr. Gagliardo, whom Amazon hired to fill them with plants, enter the picture. Margaret O'Mara, an associate professor of history at the University of Washington, sees the spheres as a kind of Walden Pond under glass. ""It's a retreat, a cathedral away from the hubbub of the city,"" she said. There was plenty of noise inside the spheres on a recent tour, as workers welded steel, pounded bolts into place and sawed concrete inside the half-built structure. The glass panels that make up the carapace of the spheres were being lowered onto steel supports in eye-catching shapes. Wearing a hard hat, Mr. Gagliardo dodged power cords and scaffolding, surveying an enormous mass of concrete where a five-story living wall — fabric pockets filled with plants — will eventually be installed. He pointed to where a glass roof panel will be removed and a 45-foot fig tree will be lifted by crane into one of the spheres, one of 40 to 50 trees that will be installed. ""Being able to walk through here, I'm starting to see where things are going to go,"" he said. The spheres will have meeting areas called treehouses, and suspension bridges high off the ground that will be just wobbly enough to quicken the pulses of employees who walk over them. ""Amazon said, 'Make this fun,'"" said Mr. Alberda, the architect. Amazon's architects had to make the spheres welcoming for both plants and people, a space with the abundance of a conservatory but without the stickiness that will fog MacBook screens and make people sweat. During the day, Amazon will keep the spheres at 72 degrees and 60 percent humidity, while at night the temperature will average 55 degrees and the humidity 85 percent, which Mr. Gagliardo said would be optimal for the cloud forest plant specimens it has collected. A growing body of academic research points to the benefits of giving employees access to nature. About a decade ago, Ihab Elzeyadi, an associate professor of architecture at the University of Oregon, conducted a study in which workers who were provided with a view of nature experienced a 20 percent reduction in sick leave from their employer, though it was not clear why that happened. Dr. Elzeyadi said he was intrigued by Amazon's sphere project, but not convinced it would be as effective as letting workers gaze at plants from their desks. ""You're making a big investment and betting on two big hypotheses,"" he said. ""Will they leave work and go there and, having that kind of nature-bathing maybe once a week, will it really impact their stress levels?"" Any respite from stress could be particularly helpful for a company that has a reputation for a sometimes punishing work environment. Until plants start moving into the spheres next spring, Mr. Gagliardo, 50, dotes on them in their temporary home in the huge greenhouse Amazon has been leasing for the last couple of years. He will continue to tend to the plants for Amazon after they are planted in the spheres. He stops by a welwitschia, a Namibian plant with two leaves, proclaiming it the ""ugliest plant in the world"" and delivering the line with such enthusiasm that it sounds like a compliment. With misters pumping water into the air, he swells with excitement discussing his current love affair with a group of begonias from Southeast Asia. ""Next week I'll be more excited about a different group,"" he said. Many of the species Amazon is growing here are endangered or extinct in the wild, acquired from botanical gardens, universities and private growers around the world. Mr. Gagliardo, who previously worked at the Atlanta Botanical Garden and in amphibian conservation, said opportunities to build a plant collection like Amazon's did not come along often. ""I'm a plant curator by heart,"" he said. ""So different plant families, amassing a collection of plants, is totally what I geek out on and go crazy about."""
0,2016-07-11," Orchids from Ecuador. Carnivorous pitcher plants. Exotic philodendrons. These are just a few of the more than 3,000 plant species that Amazon is growing to embellish its new headquarters buildings now under construction in Seattle, writes Nick Wingfield. The plants are more than about Amazon going green — they are also a monument to Amazon's increasing power: While it once shunned displays of its clout, today Amazon is building striking offices befitting its status as one of the world's most valuable public companies. And Amazon is hardly the only tech company demonstrating its edifice complex these days. In Cupertino, Calif., Apple has been building a spaceshiplike new campus that had the blessing of co-founder Steven P. Jobs. Not far away in Santa Clara, Calif., Nvidia is erecting a new headquarters, with vast open floors and wavy roofs. And Facebook retained the renowned architect Frank Gehry to design some of its new office buildings in Menlo Park, Calif., that opened last year."
0,2016-07-13," If Pokémon Go players think catching 151 different pocket monsters on their smartphones is tough, imagine trying to collect more than 15,000. That's what botanists studying the trees of the Amazon rain forest have been attempting for more than 300 years. So far, intrepid explorers have found a total of 11,676 different tree species, a new study reports. After analyzing more than 500,000 digitized samples taken of fruits, flowers and leaves, a team of ecologists has compiled what they call the first list of every known tree type in the Amazon. They published their findings Wednesday in the journal Scientific Reports. ""Before this paper we didn't have a list of Amazonian trees,"" said Nigel Pitman, a tropical forest ecologist at the Field Museum in Chicago, and an author of the study. ""With this list we are answering 'How many species have been found?' and 'What are they?'"" Dr. Pitman and his team combed through hundreds of thousands of digital records from museums around the world to create their catalog. The oldest samples were collected in 1707 and the most recent were obtained in 2015. ""What cracks me up about this paper,"" Dr. Pitman said, ""is that it's a bunch of ecologists who got impatient and said 'Let's see if we can make a quick checklist and see what we get.'"" He admits that his catalog may not have been as meticulously put together as those constructed by taxonomists who organize organisms for a living. But that's sort of the point, he added. The team wanted to create an index that would serve as the basis of a wiki that other researchers could critique and contribute to. ""This is an effort to pull together this 300-year-long research on this incredibly diverse region and convert it into a simple tool that anybody can use,"" he said. ""It's the best we can do now for someone who wants to know what trees have been collected in the Amazon."" The bonus to the team's list, according to Hans ter Steege, a tropical forest ecologist at Naturalis Biodiversity Center in the Netherlands and lead author of the paper, is that it supports their previous, hotly debated claim that there are about 16,000 tree species in the Amazon. They arrived at that estimate in 2013 after investigating the number of rare and common tree species in a sample of 5,000 tree species, and then mathematically extrapolating the figures to the greater Amazon. ""We looked at all the databases and we found nearly 12,000 species that had been collected in the Amazon,"" he said. ""That's great news — it supports our Amazon of 16,000."" The remaining 4,000 tree species may be hiding in museum drawers that have not yet been digitized, or are still undiscovered in the Amazon. According to Dr. ter Steege it may take centuries before botanists track down all the rare species. As for now, he said ""we will certainly not catch them all."""
1,2016-07-13," As far as partying is concerned, New York Fashion Week: Men's does not compare to the debauchery of the larger fashion weeks. But there were still plenty of opportunities to hang with models, designers and celebrities. The festivities began on Monday night, when the Council of Fashion Designers of America and Cadillac held a party at the Cadillac House, the car brand's new public space in Lower Manhattan. Celebrities like Kellan Lutz, Shaun White and Jerry O'Connell mingled with fashion insiders, and Common performed. On Tuesday, Amazon Fashion and East Dane, the brother site to Shopbop.com, invited scads of pretty boys to its plush Prime Lounge at Skylight Clarkson Sq. There were a few girls, too. ""I'm front row for Rochambeau tomorrow,"" said Lais Ribeiro, the Brazilian Victoria's Secret Angel, wearing a floral wrap from Alexandre Vauthier. Asked if she was worried about the surging encroachment of men's fashion week, she laughed. ""Oh, not at all,"" she said. ""The ladies support the boys."" Amazon's lounge, cocooned by velvety couches and blue curtains, was conceived as a refuge from fashion week. But as the wine flowed, the lounge became a fracas itself. In one corner, a scrum of male models whooped with glee as they reaped Amazon products raffled off via scratch cards. Another model carved out enough room to do the Running Man Challenge dance, earning cheers. Also on Tuesday night, Jefferson Hack, a founder of Dazed Media and the former Mr. Kate Moss, celebrated his new book, ""We Can't Do This Alone: Jefferson Hack the System,"" with a dinner at the Commissary, the airy new restaurant at the Metrograph, a boutique theater on the Lower East Side. Long, low-lit tables were lined with artists, actors, publishers and other alt-world luminaries from Mr. Hack's enviable orbit. ""I live in London, but I've been coming here for 20 years, so I've got quite a few friends here,"" said Mr. Hack, wearing a slim leather bomber and animal-print rockabilly shoes. The gathering felt intimately familiar, as if it were a weekly dinner party that had been going on for years, which in a sense it was. ""Oh, I've known Jefferson for about forever,"" said Leigh Lezark, the Misshapes D.J., wearing a Gucci ski sweater she'd paired with a satiny skirt. Mazdack Rassi, the Milk Studios magnate, added: ""We used to run around together 15 years ago. We slept on each other's couches, ate mustard sandwiches together."" Not everyone had known Mr. Hack since the Pampers, though. As kale salads topped with poached egg sailed out of the kitchen, the artist Urs Fisher, who contributed to the book, said: ""We met recently, on a long sailing trip. We were the only people who weren't in relationships, so we ended up talking for, like, three days."" As dinner wrapped and gave way to Drambuie-Aperol cocktails, a thespian contingent squared up at the bar. No one seemed overly concerned with men's fashion week, least of all the artist Jonah Freeman. Asked if he was attending any events, he said: ""Is that happening? Right now?"""
0,2016-07-15," Pockets of well-groomed men were spotted throughout the city last week, dashing from one party to the next. There were after-parties hosted by designers, kale salad dinners hosted by magazine editors, and corporate brands like Amazon Fashion, Cadillac and Piaget jockeying for attention. In other words, New York Fashion Week: Men's, which concluded its third season on Thursday, is settling into its groove."
0,2016-07-19," VENICE — It was after midnight on the Grand Canal here, and Plácido Domingo was standing on a floating stage slowly motoring toward the Accademia Bridge, singing the opening lines of a duet from ""Don Giovanni."" A soprano's voice answered from a second float heading to meet his, on which the actress Monica Bellucci, made up like Maria Callas in a teal gown and glittering diamonds, lip-synced seductively. The stages came together, and so did the voices. With this operatically over-the-top spectacle last week — which drew squeals and flurries of smartphone photos as people passed on a vaporetto, or water bus — Mr. Domingo became the latest classical star to shoot a cameo for ""Mozart in the Jungle,"" the Amazon comedy about a fictional New York orchestra. The series has managed to attract several galas' worth of classical headliners — past episodes have featured the pianist Lang Lang playing Ping-Pong with the violinist Joshua Bell, the pianist Emanuel Ax shuffling his feet through an interactive dance video game, and the conductor Gustavo Dudamel. The show's ability to draw so many A-listers is both a testament to its growing success, and a reflection of the fact that there are now far fewer opportunities for classical artists to appear on television, which is still an important medium for reaching, and appealing to, new audiences. ""I became a lot more famous,"" Mr. Domingo recalled as he waited in a nearby palazzo for the late-night shoot to begin, ""when I sang a duet with Miss Piggy."" Over the years, Mr. Domingo, 75, has reached broader audiences with appearances like that one, singing with Miss Piggy on a ""Night of 100 Stars"" program in 1982, as well as in cameos on popular shows, including ""The Simpsons"" and ""The Cosby Show,"" and with his own television specials. But such opportunities have become rarer for musicians in recent years, drying up just as a rapidly changing media environment — which is disrupting how politicians communicate, how people consume entertainment and news and how advertisers sell products — is posing particular challenges for the classical field. For devoted fans, a strong case can be made that it is the best of times: Streaming services allow people at home to watch concerts by the Berlin Philharmonic and performances from the Salzburg Festival, the Vienna State Opera, the Metropolitan Opera and more. But it is harder than ever for classical stars to appear on general-interest TV, leading to concerns that the field, always something of a niche when it comes to mass media, is becoming a more distant one at a time when music education is also on the wane. It was not always thus. In 1956, Elvis Presley was not the only superstar to make his debut on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" — Callas did as well, with a lengthy excerpt from Puccini's ""Tosca."" NBC used to commission and televise new operas, including Gian Carlo Menotti's ""Amahl and the Night Visitors."" The soprano Beverly Sills was not just a guest on ""The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson"" but also a guest host. The mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne appeared on the ""The Odd Couple."" David Gockley, the veteran American impresario, said that those television appearances drove a wider interest in the art form — and sold tickets. ""Our audience knew a lot of these names because they were on television,"" he recalled. ""We don't see the mainstream media paying much attention to opera these days, and it makes a difference."" Peter Gelb, the Met's general manager, said that dwindling television opportunities had forced the company to reach audiences in new ways — both by starting its Live in HD cinema simulcasts and through social media. Last season, he said, the Met's videos were viewed about 7.5 million times on Facebook and YouTube. ""We have to create our own communications systems,"" he said in a telephone interview. There are exceptions. ""Sesame Street"" still features classical musicians from time to time; the quiz show ""Jeopardy!"" has had dancers and musicians present clues; and Stephen Colbert has invited ballet dancers and classical artists on both ""The Colbert Report"" and ""The Late Show."" But those kinds of appearances are fewer and farther between. So ""Mozart in the Jungle,"" which some musicians and critics initially rolled their eyes at, has taken on an importance to classical music that grew after the show won two Golden Globes this year. The show, of course, has Mozart in its title, and is loosely based on the 2005 memoir of the same name by Blair Tindall, an oboist who set out to explore, in the words of her subtitle, ""Sex, Drugs and Classical Music."" So a good portion of the viewers who stream it may already be music fans. But with a cast that includes stars like Gael García Bernal, Bernadette Peters, Malcolm McDowell, Lola Kirke and, in a small role, Jason Schwartzman, the series also draws viewers who may not (yet) have subscriptions to their local orchestras. Paul Weitz, who was directing the episode with Mr. Domingo and is an executive producer of the show with Roman Coppola and Mr. Schwartzman, said that the possibility of reaching those viewers was especially enticing to the musicians who have appeared. ""Obviously, it's a huge issue, and it's something that is dealt with in the show a lot, about whether classical music is going to be passed on to a new generation,"" Mr. Weitz said between shots in his director's chair. ""And all these artists, the reasons that they're doing this show is because they feel like it's good for that aspect of the art — that it can bring the music to different people. And anecdotally, I think that's actually the case."" Mr. Domingo, who moved to Mexico as a child and maintains strong ties there, said that he was drawn partly by the chance to appear with Mr. García Bernal, a Mexican actor whose career he has followed since the film ""Y Tu Mamá También"" more than a decade ago, and partly because he was intrigued by a new series that shines a light on the field. So Mr. Domingo, who remains one of the hardest workers in opera, recorded his vocals for the duet, ""Là ci darem la mano,"" this month at a midnight session at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan, right after finishing a performance there in the title role of Verdi's ""Simon Boccanegra."" (The soprano part, which Ms. Bellucci, who is playing a fiery diva known as La Fiamma, lip-synced to, was recorded in San Francisco by the rising star Ana María Martínez.) And last week he flew here for a one-night shoot, the day after singing in Verdi's ""I Due Foscari"" at Teatro Real in Madrid, where he sang the role of the Doge of Venice. ""When I finished,"" he said, ""I said, 'Tomorrow I'll go to my city to see how my people are behaving.'"" The coming ""Mozart"" season will also shine a spotlight on contemporary music, with a cameo by Nico Muhly, the young American composer whose opera ""Two Boys"" was staged at the Met in 2013. He wrote a piece for the show — an aria from an imaginary opera based on the story of Amy Fisher, who at the age of 17 became known as the Long Island Lolita after shooting and severely wounding the wife of her lover. Mr. Weitz said that the aria struck the tone he strove for in the show — mixing ridiculous and comic elements with sublime moments, through music. ""Nico's fake Amy Fisher opera actually achieves that,"" he said. ""It's completely preposterous and silly and at the same time — and this was very important, it's what I was hoping for — it's actually moving."""
0,2016-07-20," SEATTLE — Microsoft is best known for software products like Windows and Office. If you bought a PC, more often than not it came with Windows, and chances are you bought a copy of Office to go with it. But the personal computers that Microsoft makes a lot of software for aren't selling the way they once did. And the company's entry into the smartphone business — which has been eating into PC sales for several years — was a disaster. It's a good thing Microsoft is determined not to miss the boat on cloud computing, a current trend that connects people over the internet to software hosted in big data centers. On Tuesday, in its quarterly earnings results, Microsoft offered strong signs that its cloud business was growing quickly. Revenue from Azure, a business Microsoft started to compete in cloud computing with Amazon, the market leader, rose more than 100 percent in the quarter. Revenue from Office 365, a subscription version of the old Office software, rose 54 percent from commercial customers and 19 percent from consumers. ""I think they've done extraordinarily well,"" said Merv Adrian, an analyst at the technology research firm Gartner. ""There's nobody else who is arguably the challenger to Amazon that Microsoft is."" Microsoft's chief executive, Satya Nadella, has made cloud computing a priority for the company since becoming chief executive two years ago. Many believed it was a move that Microsoft had long needed to make but was held back by the reluctance of its previous boss, Steven A. Ballmer. There is risk in this transition. The profit margins from renting software in the cloud are not as high as selling a license to customers, and Microsoft investors have always counted on the company to generate exceptional profits. But the cloud business model tends to be more stable — a trade-off for slimmer margins. After Microsoft's misadventures in the smartphone market, it is a necessary trade-off. Last week, the company said it would fail to meet a goal of getting its Windows 10 operating system running on one billion devices before June 2018, largely because of its retrenchment in the mobile phone business. Microsoft bought Nokia's mobile handset business in 2014 for $9.4 billion, with the goal of making Windows relevant in smartphones, a market dominated by Google's Android software and Apple's iPhones. Now the company has laid off most of the thousands of people who joined Microsoft through the deal, written off the value of nearly all of the acquisition and whittled back the number of smartphones it sells. On Tuesday, Microsoft said that its phone revenue had declined 71 percent from a year ago. For years, people have put off purchases of new machines or avoided them entirely in favor of smartphones and tablets. Last week, IDC, the technology research firm, said worldwide PC shipments fell 4.5 percent in the most recent quarter compared with a year earlier. Still, Microsoft sometimes manages to outperform the PC market, as it did this quarter, often through sales of the operating systems for higher-end machines. The company's Windows revenue from PCs sold for the professional market rose 2 percent in the quarter. Windows revenue from the nonprofessional market rose 27 percent, though that was in comparison with an unusually weak quarter last year. For the quarter ended June 30, Microsoft reported net income of $3.12 billion, or 39 cents a share, compared with a loss of $3.2 billion, or 40 cents a share, during the same period a year earlier. The company's shares jumped about 4 percent in after-hours trading following the release of its results. The loss a year ago included $8.4 billion in charges related to a write-down in the value of the smartphone business it acquired from Nokia, along with expenses from layoffs in that group. The pain continued in its most recent quarter with further write-downs and restructuring charges related to its phone business totaling $1.1 billion. Revenue fell to $20.61 billion, from $22.18 billion a year ago. The decline was partly the result of a $2 billion deferral of revenue related to Windows 10, its latest operating system. Accounting rules require Microsoft to recognize revenue from the software to be recognized in pieces over time. Without the deferral, Microsoft's revenue rose 2 percent from a year earlier to $22.64 billion, better than the $22.14 billion average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. And excluding the deferral and phone business charges, it earned 69 cents a share, better than the 58 cents a share average estimate of analysts. About 6 cents a share of the upside in its earnings was the result of a lower-than-expected tax rate, Amy Hood, Microsoft's chief financial officer, said in a phone interview. ""This is a nice strong quarter,"" said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Financial. ""It's still a company in a pivot with some declining legacy businesses."""
1,2016-07-20," In 2013, Oliver Pötzsch achieved the notable distinction of becoming the first author from Amazon's fledgling literary press, Amazon Publishing, to sell more than one million books. That his work was translated from the German and set in 17th-century Bavaria only made this achievement seem more remarkable. Mr. Pötzsch based his series of novels on the story of his ancestors, the Kuisls, a notorious dynasty of German executioners. The first book in the series, ""The Hangman's Daughter"" (Die Henkerstochter) sold unevenly when it first appeared in German bookstores. But Amazon — which has since invested heavily in translations of genre fiction — noticed the book was receiving uncommonly strong reviews on its German website and quickly scooped up the translation rights. The international success of ""The Hangman's Daughter"" series has made Mr. Pötzsch a curiosity of the publishing world and has led to many more books across a variety of genres. His latest, ""The Castle of Kings,"" published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is set during the German Peasants' War of the 16th century. It features an iconoclastic noblewoman with a flair for falconry. In this edited interview, Mr. Pötzsch discusses the pitfalls of different literary genres and how his international literary fame hasn't always followed him home to Germany. Q. Like ""The Hangman's Daughter"" books, your latest, ""The Castle of Kings,"" is set far back in German history but it's a significant departure for you in terms of the plot and subject matter. What led to it?  A. When you write books all the time about torturing and killing in the 17th century, you become a little mad and maybe your wife becomes a little anxious of you. I went to my German publisher, and I told them I wanted to write about something different: castles. As a child, I would dream of castles and fights between knights, secret chambers, hidden treasure. I love how each castle has its own brilliant, beautiful story to tell. On holidays, I'm always looking for castles to visit. And as a consequence, my own children now hate castles. But I convinced my publisher to do this castle book. They just told me, ""Write a German Ken Follett."" I think I took their suggestion too seriously because when I delivered the book it was 1,000 pages long. Luckily, it became a best-seller in Germany anyway.  What is it like, as a German author, to have achieved more success abroad than at home? When I went first to the U.S. on a book tour, they had a really big car in the airport to pick me up. They brought me to this fancy hotel with a rooftop pool. I said to myself, ""They think I'm a star! I will not correct them."" In Germany, it's not at all the case. I come home and my wife tells me to take out the rubbish. Your first books were inspired by your ancestors, who belonged to a storied dynasty of executioners. You discovered their social standing in German society was more complicated than one might imagine. Absolutely. Executioners were not only these bad guys that we know from the movies. They had a very important social status in medieval towns. They were not only killers but also healers, which is almost forgotten. Poor villagers wouldn't go to physicians — because they couldn't afford them and also because they didn't trust them. They would sometimes go to the barbers but more often would go to the executioners because they knew that executioners had experience with bodies. They would open bodies after the execution, look inside, study the organs. This is why many executioner dynasties — like my own family — ended up becoming physicians. Nevertheless, I imagine that your family and others encountered some stigma. It was considered bad luck just to meet the executioner on the street. That's why they wore masks —just even a glimpse of his eye could bring you bad luck. They were not allowed to baptize their children. They were not allowed to bury their dead in the graveyard. But it wasn't as though they could pursue another career — they had no choice. If you were born into a family of executioners, you couldn't say, ""Daddy, I don't like blood. I want to be a writer instead."" This was your job; you had to do it. And this is the reason why there were so many dynasties of executioners, like my ancestors. They married each other all the time because no one else would want them! By now you've written books across several genres: historical fiction, mystery, young adult. What do you think of all these different labels? I know why the publishing industry uses them but I'm not sure it always works. For me, the most important thing is the story. For my most recent book in Germany, which won't be published in the U.S., I had some real arguments with my publisher about genre. ""What is it?"" They asked me. ""Historical fiction? Mystery? Maybe you should write something else."" This kind of thing is hard for writers. Interestingly, the labels they use are not the same in every country. My next book, which will come out in October in the United States, was published in Germany as a classical young adult book, intended for 14-year-old boys. But in the States, it's being published as a book for readers of all ages. And if you looked at the American and German covers, you'd think they're two entirely different books."
0,2016-07-21," PRAGUE — In the age of Amazon and the internet, the idea of going to a public library to borrow a book may seem ever more quaint and old-fashioned in many parts of the world, but one country, at least, is clinging to it tenaciously: the Czech Republic. There are libraries everywhere you look in the country — it has the densest library network in the world, according to a survey conducted for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. There are more libraries than grammar schools. In fact, there is one library for every 1,971 Czech citizens, the survey found — four times as many, relative to population, as the average European country, and 10 times as many as the United States, which has one for every 19,583 people. Why so many Czech libraries? Well, for decades they were mandatory — every community, from a big city down to a tiny village, was required by law to have one. The law was enacted in 1919, soon after Czechoslovakia emerged as an independent country. The idea was to promote universal literacy and education after the country was free of the German-speaking Austro-Hungarian Empire. And it worked. ""Czechs developed a strong reading habit, and even today, those who visit libraries buy more books — 11 a year, on average — than others,"" said Vit Richter, director of the Librarianship Institute of the Czech National Library. The library law survived the German occupation, the communist era and even the breakup with Slovakia in the early 1990s. What it couldn't survive, in the end, was budgetary pressure. To save money, the requirement was dropped in 2001, when there were about 6,019 libraries in the country; since then, about 11 percent have merged or closed. Rather than just linger on as an eccentricity from a bygone age, though, the surviving Czech libraries are doing what they can to stay vibrant and relevant. They serve as polling places for elections and as local meeting venues. They organize reading clubs and art exhibits and offer computer literacy courses, and they welcome droves of schoolchildren and retirees during the day. But mostly, they do what 92 percent of Czechs still want them to go on doing, according to the Gates Foundation survey: They lend books."
0,2016-07-22," Four days into our honeymoon, my husband and I faced the end of our marriage, the end of our lives. Large bruises marred my thighs and shins. A corrosive leaf had burned a fiery triangle into Jeremy's neck. Mosquitoes competed for space on our pocked flesh. I married a brawny Canadian, an amateur naturalist with an adventurous spirit disguised by a law degree and a 9-to-9 job in Times Square. Early in our relationship, I caught a glimpse behind this facade when I found his iPhone filled with close-up photos of bizarre insects and obscure reptiles. Later, I discovered his recent Google searches included ""white capuchin monkey howl"" and ""tardigrade mating habits."" Our honeymoon began with a three-day camping trip in the Amazon rain forest. Jeremy booked the expedition through a lodge outside Iquitos, Peru, the only tour operator he could find that offered overnight stays in the open jungle. I agreed because it would be an opportunity to see Jeremy in remote wilderness, his most beloved environment. It would be like visiting his hometown together for the first time. We flew to Lima and then Iquitos, where we met our guide and traveled with him by boat to a small inlet along the Amazon River. The dilapidated lodge stood partly submerged, victim to the season's unusually fierce flooding. The rising water had washed away our trekking path, too. At Jeremy's insistence, the lodge hired a local trapper, Arnold, to lead us through uncharted territory with the lodge's own guide and tracker. Arnold lived alone in the jungle for weeks at a time. Towering foliage and oversize insects were his home territory; he would guide us through his backyard. At the outset, you could tell we were amateurs by our Osprey and Kelty backpacks. The lodge's guide and tracker slung giant potato sacks over their backs, while Arnold carried only a pink polyester girls school bag. I admired Jeremy in his jungle get-up. His dirt-crusted pants were tucked loosely into knee-high rubber boots. I watched the glint of his wedding ring appear and disappear as his hands swayed, a reminder of the lavishly joyous party we had thrown in Boston. Stomping along behind him, I wore a floppy-brimmed navy hat that I intended to look rugged but instead appeared quintessentially ""middle-age gardener."" After five hours of hiking, we arrived at a clearing. Our companions quickly worked their machetes, building a shelter from tree trunks, netting and tarps. It was just enough to protect us from the rain, mosquitoes, bullet ants, scorpions, coral snakes and cacophony of other perilous creatures that fascinated Jeremy and terrified me. The lodge had sent our guides off with minimal rations: a bag of rice, two cans of tuna and a dozen eggs (10 of them broken). To supplement, we set out on an evening hunt. Our guides found a bird sleeping in a tree several meters up, then cut down a second tree and used it to club the bird from its perch. Dinner. Jeremy awoke in the middle of the night to pee. Despite our efforts to keep the mosquito net closed, half the jungle flew in the moment a corner was lifted. Jeremy ducked back, bladder unrelieved, to commence killing the cloud of insects one by one. By the next day, Arnold was lost. To avoid the flooding, we had left the path and followed him into swampy backwoods where each step looked identical to the next. Nearly out of food and dependent on our confused guides for survival, we suggested hacking our way south until we hit the Amazon River. Yet our guides had not packed a compass, and the foliage was too thick to track the sun. Instead, we walked aimlessly as Arnold scoured the undergrowth for remnants of a footpath. There were none. We awoke the next morning to a rifle shot. Arnold dragged a bloody peccary to our campsite. It was an Amazonian wild boar, and like nearly everything in the Amazon, it was larger and more vicious than its North American relative. With precision and a hint of showmanship, Arnold skinned and gutted the 90-pound animal. He cut down large palms and briskly wove them into a backpack, which he stuffed with the dripping meat and strapped to the outside of his girls backpack. The kill caused a split in our ranks. With speed we could not possibly match, Arnold and the tracker pushed ahead, leaving our guide, Jeremy and me with a single machete to bushwhack our path. Our guide shouted ahead before turning heavily to us. ""I think they have left us,"" he said, ""to find a way home before the meat spoils."" At some point, Jeremy and I would transition in our guide's mind from clients to baggage. Having grown up in the jungle, he could feed himself for days on plants and rodents, but he could not support the three of us for long. Resigned, we set up camp. I could no longer feign being outdoorsy, so I made the only contribution I could: I became an Amazonian homemaker. I wiped dirt from the tarp, then laid out the flat sheet and ran my hand over the wrinkles. I placed our After Bite at the top and a bottle for urinating at our feet. I put Jeremy's book on the right and mine on the left, an echo of the sleeping arrangement we developed on our plush Sealy mattress in New York. We donned our sexy honeymoon evening apparel: quick-dry underwear and a headlamp. Jeremy read ""The River of Doubt,"" about Theodore Roosevelt's traumatic expedition to map one of the Amazon's tributaries. I read ""Confessions of a Shopaholic."" ""Are you scared?"" I asked. Jeremy squinted, raising his hand to block the beam of my headlamp. ""Of course not,"" he said. ""Worse comes to worst, we get back a few days late and a bit hungry. There's probably enough information in my book to find edible food."" It wasn't until days later, as we drank pisco sours next to open windows at Restaurante Fitzcarraldo in Iquitos, that he would admit how scared he'd been. Scared that a venomous snake would bite me, and we'd be too far away to get treatment. Scared that we'd starve to death, because there wasn't anything in his Roosevelt book about how to forage for food. ""It's more,"" he said with a grin, ""about people dying in gruesome ways."" Lying on a tarp in the jungle that night, we felt entirely useless and infantile, unable to eat or walk without a guide. So we stitched together a false reality where we played important roles as comforter and protector, as receiver of comfort and beneficiary of protection. We talked about our lives. At a time when our future felt tenuous, we went ahead and created it, chattering about how many children we would have and what we would teach them. How we would instill a love of adventure and an understanding of the difference between risk and recklessness, something we were just beginning to grasp. ""Make me laugh?"" I asked. Jeremy folded his wrists back and held them up to his ears. ""Who am I?"" I giggled, a welcome moment of relief. ""The dog."" ""Now your turn,"" he said. Outside, we heard a muffled hum in the distance. ""A boat!"" our guide exclaimed. We could not be more than eight or 10 hours from the Amazon River. Tomorrow, we would follow the sound southward looking for a path to the river. From there, we could find a boat back to the lodge. Come dawn, that's exactly what we did. Our first step on the dock that evening was joyous. We threw down our packs and muscled off our wet rain boots. We sat in awe and silence and exhaustion until we regained the strength to drag ourselves to the honeymoon suite, a large room that had running water but lacked electricity. We showered. Lying side by side on a lumpy mattress, we counted our bruises. We were safe, together. I had paid my dues for my nature lover of a husband, and we were all the better for it. On the morning of our departure, we opted for one last short trek with our guide. Along the way, he called us over, pointing a stick at a coral snake resting under a large leaf. We crowded around. Jeremy confirmed the beauty of the animal and explained that its poison was neurotoxic. You could die within hours of respiratory arrest as your lungs failed to expand and your major organs wilted from hypoxia. There was a whole section on it in the Roosevelt book. With another poke, the snake lunged at us, lifting most of its body a foot in the air. ""Run, run, run!"" the guide shouted. The snake slithered away. So did we, first to Iquitos, then to a four-star hotel in Colombia, and finally, armed with our newfound survival skills, into the disorienting wilderness of married life."
0,2016-07-25," WASHINGTON — Amazon has partnered with the British government to significantly expand drone testing, a move that could allow the devices to deliver packages to British homes far earlier than in the United States. Under the partnership, Britain's aviation regulator will let Amazon test several aspects of drone technology — such as piloting the machines beyond the line of sight of its operators — that the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States has not permitted. The tests, which are an important sign of confidence in Britain after its historic vote last month to leave the European Union, are to begin immediately. ""The U.K. is a leader in enabling drone innovation,"" Paul Misener, Amazon's vice president of global innovation policy and communications, said in a statement. ""This announcement strengthens our partnership with the U.K. and brings Amazon closer to our goal of using drones to safely deliver parcels in 30 minutes to customers in the U.K. and elsewhere around the world."" The move puts pressure on the F.A.A., which had recently rebuffed requests by Amazon, Google and other drone makers to advance their delivery plans. The tech behemoths and other drone makers have aggressively lobbied the F.A.A. to authorize the devices to significantly reduce costs to transport goods by airplane, freight and trucks. Amazon said it hoped success with the drone trials in Britain would encourage more hesitant regulators in the United States and elsewhere to loosen restrictions. The trials will ""help identify what operating rules and safety regulations will be needed to help move the drone industry forward,"" the company said in a statement. Amazon will work with British regulators to test drones that fly beyond the line of sight of operators in rural and suburban areas. It will also test whether a single operator can safely command multiple drones at once, as well as technology that lets the machines automatically detect and avoid other planes, buildings and people. Amazon's plan to use drone delivery will rely on those functions, a vision first described by the e-commerce company's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, on CBS's ""60 Minutes"" in December 2013. Mr. Bezos has since pointed to regulation as the biggest obstacle to the delivery of small packages by drones. The Seattle company has grown increasingly frustrated with the F.A.A.'s cautious approach to its plans. Mr. Misener said in a Senate hearing in March 2015 that by the time regulators approved limited testing for certain Amazon drone models, those machines were already obsolete. Amazon has since moved more research and development of its drones to Britain, Canada and the Netherlands; the company views its partnership with Britain as its most advanced. The Civil Aviation Authority — the British equivalent of the F.A.A. — said it may also enter into similar partnerships with other commercial drone makers. ""We want to enable the innovation that arises from the development of drone technology by safely integrating drones into the overall aviation system,"" said Tim Johnson, policy director of the Civil Aviation Authority. ""These tests by Amazon will help inform our policy and future approach."" United States regulators have been reluctant to permit drone delivery because of safety concerns. Amazon wants to be able to fly its drones at night and miles beyond the sight of operators. The company said it has developed ""sense and avoid"" technology to prevent collisions, which it has not been able to broadly test in the United States. Amazon said it does not plan to decrease its drone investments in the United States and will continue to push for F.A.A. approval. Aviation analysts predict the United States will eventually permit drone delivery, but not in the next year or two. ""The concern is that companies will significantly shift their drone testing or implementation programs to other countries,"" said Michael Sievers, co-chairman of the Unmanned Systems Group at Hunton & Williams, a law firm based in Richmond, Va. ""This is more likely the case for near-term testing, but even then the effect is likely limited, as there is a cost to such relocations."""
1,2016-07-25," When it comes to cloud computing, Google is in a very unfamiliar position: seriously behind. Google is chasing Amazon and Microsoft for control of the next generation of business technology, in enormous cloud-computing data centers. Cloud systems are cheap and flexible, and companies are quickly shifting their technologies for that environment. According to analysts at Gartner, the global cloud-computing business will be worth $67 billion by 2020, compared with $23 billion at the end of this year. ""The world's biggest maker of computer servers is making machines just for these guys,"" said John Lovelock, a cloud analyst at Gartner. ""It's the nexus of things like big data, social networks and mobility, and the next big thing, which is artificial intelligence."" For Google, a loss in cloud computing would be a rare misstep for a company that revolutionized media with its advertising business, and then made the world's leading smartphone operating system. A victory for Google, however, could change how we work, turning advanced computing into an everyday utility that we use to run factories, interact in virtual reality or read one another's emotions. Given Google's track record, it's worth considering the prospect. But it will be an uphill climb. Amazon Web Services, which began its cloud product a decade ago, remains the leader. The company took in $2.6 billion, 9 percent of Amazon's sales, in the first quarter of 2016. Profits from the service made up 56 percent of Amazon's operating income. Those numbers may well be higher when Amazon reports its second-quarter earnings on Thursday. Microsoft styled itself a cloud company, too, and the company said last week that revenue from Azure, its cloud business, which was founded in 2010, rose 100 percent over the last year. Cloud technology also figures in crucial businesses like Office 365. In contrast, Google Cloud Platform does not even figure in the earnings reports of Alphabet, Google's parent company. That has to sting, since the company owns perhaps the largest network of computers on the planet, spending close to $10 billion a year to handle services like search, Gmail and YouTube. Google is moving rapidly to change things. Three announcements it made last week show how it hopes to gain ground on Amazon Web Services and Azure. First, the company said it has used artificial intelligence to cut the power use in its data centers 15 percent, a huge decrease considering how efficient these data factories were already. Power is probably the largest single cost for all three of the cloud companies. Google is almost certain to use its savings to reduce prices, much the way it won in search advertising by figuring out its competitors' costs, then undercutting them. That ability to find energy efficiency may be a powerful tool to sell to others over Google Compute. Mustafa Suleyman, the head of applied artificial intelligence at the company's DeepMind subsidiary, said the techniques could be used at power plants, refineries and other big industrial systems. ""This certainly gives Google an edge,"" he said. ""Other people focused on narrow problems. We've focused on the widest possible problem."" Google also released for public use ways to transcribe and analyze recorded speech for things like meaning, emotional content and whether a speaker was happy or sad. An outside company that worked on the project — Google would not say which one — used it to analyze over two billion minutes of customer service calls. It works in 80 languages, Google said. At the same time, the company moved its customers on the United States West Coast from a data center in Iowa to facilities in Oregon. Google's network, which it claims is larger than the internet, can send the equivalent of 375 hours of video a second. A move like that only makes sense when a company wants to offer the kind of split-second performance needed for virtual reality or instantaneous customer interactions over networks of cellphones and sensors. At a recent conference at Amazon Web Services for software developers, an executive from iRobot, which makes the Roomba vacuuming robot, talked about using the cloud to map homes and human behavior in houses with potentially ""hundreds"" of connected devices. Doing something like that would require instantaneous connections. Can faster networks, lower prices and lots of artificial intelligence put Google ahead? Amazon's lead seems to give it an edge for at least the next couple of years, as its cloud branch has perfected a method of developing hundreds of new cloud features annually. Yet while the company appears to have some basic artificial intelligence features, called machine learning, it seems to have little in the way of speech recognition or translation. Mr. Lovelock, the Gartner analyst, predicted that Google would offer businesses the insights it has gained from years of watching people online. ""Amazon views the customer as the person paying the bill, while Google believes the customer is the end user of a service,"" he said. And Microsoft is promoting itself as the company that has products customers already know and use. ""Everyone has to play to the strengths the market already sees they have,"" Mr. Lovelock said."
2,2016-07-25," This week will offer a glimpse into just how dominant some of the world's biggest technology companies have become. Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet are all scheduled to post their quarterly earnings this week, giving a report card on their strength and reach in areas like online advertising, e-commerce, mobile gadgets and cloud computing. For one of these companies, Alphabet, this week's earnings report will also be an almost-anniversary of sorts. It was nearly a year ago that Google announced that it would be evolving into a holding company structure, with a parent company known as Alphabet and different units — like Google, Nest and Calico — underneath it. How that transformation has been rippling through what was once Google can be seen through the X division, writes Conor Dougherty. X, formerly Google X, is the company's ""moonshot"" factory, which has worked on fantastical projects like a self-driving car (now more reality than fantasy) and stratospheric balloons that can beam the internet. With Alphabet trying to enforce more financial discipline over its various units, X has also been trying to better systematize its research and pay more attention to the bottom line. Read about the results here."
0,2016-07-27," BILL PYSZCZYMUKA was installing an air-conditioner in an upstairs window last spring when it occurred to him that there was a way to control the machine without getting up from the couch downstairs: his Amazon Echo. Mr. Pyszczymuka, who lives in Schenectady, N.Y., figured the Echo — Amazon's $180 internet-connected speaker — could be connected to an app that controls a Wi-Fi-connected power plug. By plugging the air-conditioner into the smart power outlet, he could turn the air-conditioner on or off just by speaking a command to the Echo. ""The moment of truth came when I asked, 'Alexa, turn on the air-conditioner,'"" he said. ""The unit beeped upstairs, with Alexa telling me, 'O.K.' I thought it was more than O.K. It was cool."" Mr. Pyszczymuka is part of a prolific community of Echo tinkerers who are using the smart speaker for much more than playing music. Since Amazon released the Echo last year, it has quickly become the top-selling home audio speaker on Amazon.com and one of the company's most successful hardware products. While Amazon, which reports quarterly earnings on Thursday, has not revealed how many Echos it has sold, people have put the speaker to work as a shopping assistant, kitchen companion and home automation tool. Yet making the Echo a smarter speaker is not intuitive. And, if consumers do not do any research or tinkering, Amazon's virtual assistant, Alexa, can appear lacking in capabilities compared with Apple's Siri and Google's voice assistant. That's because Alexa's database isn't as mature or thorough as others that have been on the market longer. So I recently revisited the Echo to unearth some of the best tips to getting the most from Alexa. Here's a rundown. Let's start with the basics: Consumers can make their Echo a hipper audio player by tweaking just a few settings. By default, the Echo will play music from Amazon's streaming music library. But Amazon recently let people change the default music player to more popular streaming services, like Spotify and Pandora. To change the default music player, open the Alexa smartphone app. Then tap Settings, tap Music and Media, and tap Choose Default Music Services and select Spotify for your default music library or Pandora for your default station service. That way, you no longer have to say ""Play Radiohead on Spotify"" or ""Play Radiohead on station Pandora"" — you can just say ""Play Radiohead"" or ""Play Radiohead station"" and the Echo will play music from your service of choice. (Apple Music and Google Play are not supported by the Echo.) Other audio tricks include the ability to ask Alexa to play specific podcasts — try speaking a command like ""Alexa, Play 'Fresh Air'"" (the NPR show) or ""Alexa, Play 'This American Life'"" (also from NPR). An often-forgotten feature of the Echo is its ability to play live radio stations from all over the world. Just ask Alexa to play the call letters of your favorite radio station like KQED, and the Echo will stream it. Echo tinkerers have been putting the speaker to work in their kitchens. One reason: you can summon Alexa without touching the device, which makes it extremely helpful while preparing food or putting dishes away. Try these basics to get acquainted with Alexa in the kitchen: After you stick a pie or roast in the oven, ask Alexa to set a timer. Need help tripling a recipe? Ask Alexa to do the math (""Alexa, what is three times 127?""). Need to know how many tablespoons are in a cup? Ask Alexa to make the conversion for you. Alexa can also help restock your kitchen. If you are an Amazon Prime subscriber and are running out of something like Ziploc bags, just say ""Alexa, order Ziploc bags"" to place an Amazon order right away. If you prefer to pick up the item at a store, say, ""Alexa, add Ziploc bags to my shopping list"" to affix items to a shopping list in the Alexa smartphone app. The best part about using Alexa to compile a shopping list is that multiple family members can add to it, even after you have left the house. Now that you're well acclimated to Alexa, consider some advanced hacks, such as configuring the Echo to control different parts of your home, including the thermostat and the light bulbs. This will require buying more gear. One useful product to buy to expand Echo's utility is TP-Link's $25 Smart Plug, a Wi-Fi-connected electrical outlet. It can be used to toggle on and off an appliance that you plug into it, like a lamp or portable fan — or, if you're creative like Mr. Pyszczymuka, an air-conditioner unit. Setting up the Smart Plug takes a few minutes. I plugged a bedroom lamp into the Smart Plug, then downloaded the free smartphone app Kasa, which detected the Smart Plug and connected it to my Wi-Fi network. Then I opened the Alexa smartphone app, added the Kasa ""skill"" (third-party apps for Alexa are called skills) and connected Alexa with my Smart Plug. I subsequently gave the lamp a friendly name: bedroom lamp. Now at night, I can say ""Alexa, turn on the bedroom lamp"" to light up the bedroom before I walk down the hall. Fancier light setups are available, too. Philips offers smart light kits called Hue, and its companion app can be used to adjust some Hue bulbs into hundreds of colors. I connected a Philips Hue light strip with the Echo using an internet algorithm on the website If This Then That. Then I tweaked the recipe to turn the light strip red whenever I said ""Alexa, trigger 'Game of Thrones'"" — which set the mood during viewings of the HBO show. Another nifty use of Alexa is how it can control a smart thermostat, which I tested with my Wi-Fi-controlled Honeywell thermostat. In the Alexa app, I added the Honeywell skill, then scanned for the thermostat and labeled it Honeywell. Saying ""Echo, set Honeywell to 80 degrees"" set the heater to that temperature. (Alexa also works with other smart thermostats like Nest and the Ecobee 3.) Some Echo tinkerers have been even more ambitious about hooking up their homes. One Reddit user made Echo open and close window blinds. Others have bought smart home kits like Samsung's $249 SmartThings system, which can be set up to connect with different sensors like a water leak detector or a motion sensor. Larger projects like these are expensive and take more technical skill, so I recommend starting with basics like smart lights, plugs and thermostats. Then you can assess whether you need a much smarter home. Looking for more things to do with Echo? Open the Alexa app and add these three skills — TV Shows, The Bartender and Uber. Then next time you're couch-surfing, ask Alexa a question like ""Ask TV Shows what time 'Last Week Tonight' airs"" to find out what time the show is on. (The answer: Sunday at 11 p.m. eastern on HBO.) Or when trying a new cocktail recipe, say to Alexa, ""Ask the bartender how to make a Manhattan"" to get a list of ingredients and instructions. And while you are tying your shoes and getting ready to go out, say, ""Alexa, ask Uber to request an UberX"" to summon a car to your home. The downside of forming a bond with Echo and Alexa? You will wish it can help you with everything, everywhere — including filing an expense report on the go or turning down the volume of a loud co-worker. At least you will always have a friend waiting for you at home."
0,2016-07-28," SEATTLE — For most of its life, Amazon sacrificed profits if it could build another few warehouses to ship orders to customers more quickly or find some other investment to fuel its growth. Now, it cannot avoid showing big profits thanks to the lucrative cloud computing business in which it has improbably become a leader. On Thursday, Amazon reported net income of $857 million in its most recent quarter, the third quarter in a row in which it has shown a record profit. Its net income for those three months was also more than nine times the amount for the same period last year. A big part of what has made Amazon's story as a company so captivating to investors is the single-minded focus of Jeffrey P. Bezos, the company's founder and chief executive, on making big long-term investments. Unlike Google and Facebook, which have highly profitable advertising businesses, Amazon's retail business has operated on thin profit margins that quickly vanish when the company begins spending heavily, pushing it into the red. What is most striking about its recent habit of showing profits is that Amazon has not suddenly become stingy about making investments. In a conference call, Amazon's chief financial officer, Brian Olsavsky, said that the company would open 18 new fulfillment centers — the warehouses from which it processes customer orders — in the third quarter of this year, three times the number it opened in the same period last year. Amazon plans to nearly double its spending on digital video during the second half of the year as it expands the offerings of its Netflix-like streaming service, he said. That spending increase reflects a nearly tripling in the number of original television shows and movies financed by Amazon. ""I would not take our financial results as an indication we're running out of investment opportunities,"" Mr. Olsavsky said. For the second quarter, which ended June 30, Amazon reported net income of $857 million, or $1.78 a share, up from $92 million, or 19 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue jumped 31 percent to $30.4 billion from $23.19 billion a year ago. The results were well above the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters of $1.11 a share in earnings and $29.55 billion in revenue. ""They're starting to really prove out their profitability,"" said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. Amazon's shares rose more than 2 percent in after-hours trading after the release of its results. The company reported operating income of $718 million from its Amazon Web Services business, up from $305 million a year ago. That is slightly more than the profit it showed from its North American retail business. The North American retail business, though, brought in $17.67 billion in revenue compared with $2.89 billion for Amazon Web Services, an indication of the significantly higher profit margins in cloud computing. Amazon first began renting access to computers and software in its data centers over a decade ago. While it was dismissed by many for straying from its focus on electronic retailing, it is now the leader in cloud computing, ahead of companies like Microsoft and Google. Still, the retail business that Amazon is best known for is growing at a torrid pace even though it is now more than two decades old. The company's North American retail revenue jumped 28 percent as it continued to benefit from a shift in consumer spending to online from offline stores. The company's spending on new warehouses and delivery services has played an important role in helping it gobble up a bigger portion of the money people spend on consumer goods. ""They are defying the laws of gravity,"" said Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. ""It shows their level of market share gains is increasing."""
0,2016-07-29," PROFITS TUMBLE AT EUROPEAN BANKS UBS said its second-quarter profit dropped 14 percent from a year earlier because uncertainty in financial markets was weighing on its wealth management and investment banking businesses. Like Credit Suisse the day before, the bank was cautious about risks ahead. ""Sustained market volatility, underlying macroeconomic uncertainty and heightened geopolitical tensions, exacerbated by the impact of the U.K. referendum vote to end E.U. membership, will lead to continued client risk aversion and generally low transaction volumes,"" it said. Lower-than-anticipated interest rates and the strength of the Swiss franc were also expected to create difficulties. The British bank Barclays also reported a drop in profits, of 41 percent. Its chief executive, James E. Staley, said the bank saw no reason to adjust its strategy of focusing on its British consumer bank and the corporate and investment bank in light of Britain's vote to leave the European Union. BLOCKBUSTER EARNINGS FROM GOOGLE AND AMAZON Thursday was a bonanza for Google and Amazon, which both reported blockbuster results and showed their dominance – on phones for Google and in the cloud for Amazon. Google's revamped ad formats helped drive revenue to $21.5 billion in the second quarter – a 21 percent jump from a year earlier and more than analysts had predicted. These results show that the near future still looks rosy for the company, although some analysts say that Google will need to do some innovation close to home as the rewards from its moonshot projects are still some time away. Amazon, which began renting access to computers and software in its data centers over a decade ago, reported operating income of $718 million from its web services business – more than the profit of $305 million made a year ago and more than the profits from its North American retail business. Still, the retail business is also growing speedily, with revenue in North America jumping 28 percent. ON THE AGENDA The Commerce Department will publish its first estimate of economic growth during the second quarter at 8:30 a.m. Merck, ExxonMobil and Chevron all report second-quarter earnings. REDSTONE TRIAL SET FOR OCTOBER The legal battle over Sumner M. Redstone's mental capacity to make decisions about his media empire will take place in October at a Massachusetts court house.

Philippe P. Dauman and George S. Abrams, two longtime confidants of Mr. Redstone, were dismissed in May and they are challenging Mr. Redstone's mental capacity.

1,2016-07-29," SEATTLE — Inside an office in this city's South Lake Union neighborhood, engineers in lab coats fuss over a contraption unlike the usual creations flowing from Amazon, Facebook and other technology companies with offices nearby. It's a satellite the size of a large duffel bag that will be lobbed into orbit in August, as part of a constellation of cameras that will take aerial pictures of Earth and deliver them to customers faster and cheaper than in the past. The company building it, Spaceflight Industries, is one of a growing number of start-ups springing up in Seattle for the same reasons the area has been so hospitable to internet and software companies. ""It's about software, big data, and it's about capital,"" said Jason Andrews, the chief executive of Spaceflight, which also arranges ""ride-shares"" — think Uber for rockets — for small satellites to tag along on bigger missions. ""Seattle is an epicenter for all three."" There's more activity than ever in the commercial space race, with a new wave of entrepreneurs attempting to do everything from lowering the cost of putting something into space, with reusable rockets, to mining asteroids. With their mix of universities, government space facilities, technology talent and financial risk takers, the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Denver and other cities have become especially fertile grounds for space start-ups. No single spot can claim to be the Silicon Valley of such companies yet, but Seattle is on the short list of contenders, investors and entrepreneurs say. The area is home to two tech billionaires — Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft — who are funding ambitious, varied efforts to make space more accessible. They have been joined by a few smaller companies like Spaceflight, attracted by Seattle's abundant supply of software engineers from stalwarts like Amazon and Microsoft and aerospace experts from Boeing, the aviation giant that has major operations in the area. ""I think we're putting the space back into the Space Needle,"" Charles Beames, the president of Vulcan Aerospace, Mr. Allen's space investment company, said in a recent interview. The city's iconic tower, created for the 1962 World's Fair, long symbolized Seattle's perception of itself as a visionary town with an eye on the 21st century. That was initially rooted in its aviation prominence, which earned it the nickname Jet City. Software and the internet, though, created the vast wealth that allowed space junkies like Mr. Bezos and Mr. Allen, who grew up fascinated by the Apollo moon landings, to pursue their space dreams. Mr. Bezos founded Blue Origin in nearby Kent, Wash. — a company that recently launched its New Shepard rocket and returned it to a launchpad in Texas for the fourth time, demonstrating the reusability that is a key to making space access cheaper. Blue Origin recently said it planned to begin testing its rocket with astronauts next year, and aimed to begin sending space tourists on a short suborbital flight the year after that. Mr. Allen's Vulcan Aerospace is funding the creation of the largest airplane in the world by wingspan, Stratolaunch, which will drop rockets from about 30,000 feet moments before they blast into space. Vulcan believes its approach will allow it to send satellites into space more reliably and efficiently by, for example, flying around bad weather. The plane is being built in Mojave, Calif., outside Los Angeles, though Vulcan is in Seattle. Entrepreneurs credit Mr. Allen with helping to ignite the current commercial gusto for space in 2004 when a rocket-powered plane he financed, SpaceShipOne, won the $10 million Ansari X Prize for becoming the first manned, reusable private spacecraft to reach space. Another high-profile space entrepreneur, Elon Musk, doesn't have the same personal connection to the Seattle area. But he does visit to prospect for talent for his rocket company, Space Exploration Technologies, known as SpaceX. Headquartered in Hawthorne, Calif., SpaceX has centered its development of a satellite communications system in Redmond, Wash. ""The reason for it is pretty straightforward,"" Mr. Musk, also the chief executive of the electric-car maker Tesla, told an audience in Seattle last year at a recruiting event. ""There's a huge amount of talent in the Seattle area, and a lot of you guys don't seem to want to move to L.A."" One reason that Seattle is attractive is that space companies are no longer looking primarily for aerospace engineers. Planetary Resources, a start-up in Redmond, Wash., has plans for one of the more implausible-sounding space businesses, dedicated to mining asteroids for materials like water. The hydrogen and oxygen in water can be processed in space into fuel for craft headed into deep space or satellites orbiting the earth, the company said. The company's chief executive, Chris Lewicki, said it planned to attach a probe to asteroids and use inflatable solar reflectors to concentrate the sun's energy on the surface of the asteroid, allowing Planetary Resources to capture water as it is baked out. But Planetary Resources, which has attracted investments from Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, top executives at Google's parent company, Alphabet, first plans to use infrared and hyperspectral imaging sensors to analyze asteroids for the most promising targets, essentially a big data problem. The company will begin testing the sensors later this year when it plans to launch a new spacecraft, Arkyd 6, to scan the earth for natural resources. Mr. Lewicki said in an interview that one of the company's largest teams was its software group. The supply of software and traditional aerospace talent made the Seattle area an obvious choice, said Mr. Lewicki, who worked at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory on its Mars missions. ""It's a powerhouse on both the software and hardware side,"" said Joe Landon, the chairman of the Space Angels Network, which connects private investors with space start-ups. A few years ago, the state formed a consortium, the Washington State Space Coalition, to help raise the fledgling industry's profile and improve communication among entrepreneurs, academics and government representatives. In a coup, the coalition lured a private space industry conference, NewSpace, to Seattle last month after it had been held in Silicon Valley for almost a decade. ""What we're trying to do in the state of Washington is we're trying to nurture that ecosystem,"" said John Thornquist, head of the state's Office of Aerospace. Money is flowing into the new space industry, though at a significantly slower rate than it is into more traditional technology companies. Since 2000, the investment in space start-ups has totaled $13.3 billion, including a record $2.7 billion last year, the Tauri Group, a research firm, estimated. How much of that found its way to Seattle is difficult to say, partly because Mr. Allen and Mr. Bezos, who are believed to be spending heavily, won't say how much they've invested. Still, it remains to be seen whether Seattle's space scene can move beyond the relatively small number of companies and investors propping it up now to become a durable industry. At the NewSpace conference, an executive from Aerojet Rocketdyne, which has been making space propulsion systems in the area for decades, told an audience to expect failures. ""Many of the current new space companies are not going to be around in 10 to 20 years,"" said Fred Wilson, Aerojet Rocketdyne's director of marketing and business development. Seattle has seen its space ambitions lose momentum before. In 1965, Boeing opened the Boeing Space Center, a facility on 430 acres in nearby Kent, where it developed lunar rovers used on Apollo missions.

3,2016-07-29," PROFITS TUMBLE AT EUROPEAN BANKS UBS said its second-quarter profit dropped 14 percent from a year earlier because uncertainty in financial markets was weighing on its wealth management and investment banking businesses. Like Credit Suisse the day before, the bank was cautious about risks ahead. ""Sustained market volatility, underlying macroeconomic uncertainty and heightened geopolitical tensions, exacerbated by the impact of the U.K. referendum vote to end E.U. membership, will lead to continued client risk aversion and generally low transaction volumes,"" it said. Lower-than-anticipated interest rates and the strength of the Swiss franc were also expected to create difficulties. The British bank Barclays also reported a drop in profits, of 41 percent. Its chief executive, James E. Staley, said the bank saw no reason to adjust its strategy of focusing on its British consumer bank and the corporate and investment bank in light of Britain's vote to leave the European Union. BLOCKBUSTER EARNINGS FROM GOOGLE AND AMAZON Thursday was a bonanza for Google and Amazon, which both reported blockbuster results and showed their dominance – on phones for Google and in the cloud for Amazon. Google's revamped ad formats helped drive revenue to $21.5 billion in the second quarter – a 21 percent jump from a year earlier and more than analysts had predicted. These results show that the near future still looks rosy for the company, although some analysts say that Google will need to do some innovation close to home as the rewards from its moonshot projects are still some time away. Amazon, which began renting access to computers and software in its data centers over a decade ago, reported operating income of $718 million from its web services business – more than the profit of $305 million made a year ago and more than the profits from its North American retail business. Still, the retail business is also growing speedily, with revenue in North America jumping 28 percent. ON THE AGENDA The Commerce Department will publish its first estimate of economic growth during the second quarter at 8:30 a.m. Merck, ExxonMobil and Chevron all report second-quarter earnings.

PROPUBLICA"
4,2016-07-29," SEATTLE — Inside an office in this city's South Lake Union neighborhood, engineers in lab coats fuss over a contraption unlike the usual creations flowing from Amazon, Facebook and other technology companies with offices nearby. It's a satellite the size of a large duffel bag that will be lobbed into orbit in August, as part of a constellation of cameras that will take aerial pictures of Earth and deliver them to customers faster and cheaper than in the past. The company building it, Spaceflight Industries, is one of a growing number of start-ups springing up in Seattle for the same reasons the area has been so hospitable to internet and software companies. ""It's about software, big data, and it's about capital,"" said Jason Andrews, the chief executive of Spaceflight, which also arranges ""ride-shares"" — think Uber for rockets — for small satellites to tag along on bigger missions. ""Seattle is an epicenter for all three."" There's more activity than ever in the commercial space race, with a new wave of entrepreneurs attempting to do everything from lowering the cost of putting something into space, with reusable rockets, to mining asteroids. With their mix of universities, government space facilities, technology talent and financial risk takers, the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Denver and other cities have become especially fertile grounds for space start-ups. No single spot can claim to be the Silicon Valley of such companies yet, but Seattle is on the short list of contenders, investors and entrepreneurs say. The area is home to two tech billionaires — Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft — who are funding ambitious, varied efforts to make space more accessible. They have been joined by a few smaller companies like Spaceflight, attracted by Seattle's abundant supply of software engineers from stalwarts like Amazon and Microsoft and aerospace experts from Boeing, the aviation giant that has major operations in the area. ""I think we're putting the space back into the Space Needle,"" Charles Beames, the president of Vulcan Aerospace, Mr. Allen's space investment company, said in a recent interview. The city's iconic tower, created for the 1962 World's Fair, long symbolized Seattle's perception of itself as a visionary town with an eye on the 21st century. That was initially rooted in its aviation prominence, which earned it the nickname Jet City. Software and the internet, though, created the vast wealth that allowed space junkies like Mr. Bezos and Mr. Allen, who grew up fascinated by the Apollo moon landings, to pursue their space dreams. Mr. Bezos founded Blue Origin in nearby Kent, Wash. — a company that recently launched its New Shepard rocket and returned it to a launchpad in Texas for the fourth time, demonstrating the reusability that is a key to making space access cheaper. Blue Origin recently said it planned to begin testing its rocket with astronauts next year, and aimed to begin sending space tourists on a short suborbital flight the year after that. Mr. Allen's Vulcan Aerospace is funding the creation of the largest airplane in the world by wingspan, Stratolaunch, which will drop rockets from about 30,000 feet moments before they blast into space. Vulcan believes its approach will allow it to send satellites into space more reliably and efficiently by, for example, flying around bad weather. The plane is being built in Mojave, Calif., outside Los Angeles, though Vulcan is in Seattle. Entrepreneurs credit Mr. Allen with helping to ignite the current commercial gusto for space in 2004 when a rocket-powered plane he financed, SpaceShipOne, won the $10 million Ansari X Prize for becoming the first manned, reusable private spacecraft to reach space. Another high-profile space entrepreneur, Elon Musk, doesn't have the same personal connection to the Seattle area. But he does visit to prospect for talent for his rocket company, Space Exploration Technologies, known as SpaceX. Headquartered in Hawthorne, Calif., SpaceX has centered its development of a satellite communications system in Redmond, Wash. ""The reason for it is pretty straightforward,"" Mr. Musk, also the chief executive of the electric-car maker Tesla, told an audience in Seattle last year at a recruiting event. ""There's a huge amount of talent in the Seattle area, and a lot of you guys don't seem to want to move to L.A."" One reason that Seattle is attractive is that space companies are no longer looking primarily for aerospace engineers. Planetary Resources, a start-up in Redmond, Wash., has plans for one of the more implausible-sounding space businesses, dedicated to mining asteroids for materials like water. The hydrogen and oxygen in water can be processed in space into fuel for craft headed into deep space or satellites orbiting the earth, the company said. The company's chief executive, Chris Lewicki, said it planned to attach a probe to asteroids and use inflatable solar reflectors to concentrate the sun's energy on the surface of the asteroid, allowing Planetary Resources to capture water as it is baked out. But Planetary Resources, which has attracted investments from Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, top executives at Google's parent company, Alphabet, first plans to use infrared and hyperspectral imaging sensors to analyze asteroids for the most promising targets, essentially a big data problem. The company will begin testing the sensors later this year when it plans to launch a new spacecraft, Arkyd 6, to scan the earth for natural resources. Mr. Lewicki said in an interview that one of the company's largest teams was its software group. The supply of software and traditional aerospace talent made the Seattle area an obvious choice, said Mr. Lewicki, who worked at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory on its Mars missions. ""It's a powerhouse on both the software and hardware side,"" said Joe Landon, the chairman of the Space Angels Network, which connects private investors with space start-ups. A few years ago, the state formed a consortium, the Washington State Space Coalition, to help raise the fledgling industry's profile and improve communication among entrepreneurs, academics and government representatives. In a coup, the coalition lured a private space industry conference, NewSpace, to Seattle last month after it had been held in Silicon Valley for almost a decade. ""What we're trying to do in the state of Washington is we're trying to nurture that ecosystem,"" said John Thornquist, head of the state's Office of Aerospace. Money is flowing into the new space industry, though at a significantly slower rate than it is into more traditional technology companies. Since 2000, the investment in space start-ups has totaled $13.3 billion, including a record $2.7 billion last year, the Tauri Group, a research firm, estimated. How much of that found its way to Seattle is difficult to say, partly because Mr. Allen and Mr. Bezos, who are believed to be spending heavily, won't say how much they've invested. Still, it remains to be seen whether Seattle's space scene can move beyond the relatively small number of companies and investors propping it up now to become a durable industry. At the NewSpace conference, an executive from Aerojet Rocketdyne, which has been making space propulsion systems in the area for decades, told an audience to expect failures. ""Many of the current new space companies are not going to be around in 10 to 20 years,"" said Fred Wilson, Aerojet Rocketdyne's director of marketing and business development. Seattle has seen its space ambitions lose momentum before. In 1965, Boeing opened the Boeing Space Center, a facility on 430 acres in nearby Kent, where it developed lunar rovers used on Apollo missions. In 2010, Boeing began selling off chunks of the property and moving employees to other locations. Now, one of the big tenants is Amazon, which has a couple of warehouses there."

6,2016-07-29," The world of enterprise software and computing is not sexy — in fact, the mere mention of it may put you to sleep. But if you're still with me, there's been plenty of action in that world lately. Oracle, the behemoth maker of software for businesses, on Thursday announced its biggest acquisition in more than a decade, with a $9.3 billion agreement to buy NetSuite. NetSuite specializes in accounting and other back-office e-commerce software, especially for smaller businesses, and the deal goes to the heart of Oracle's attempt to reinvent itself for the cloud-computing era, where software is accessed over the internet, write Quentin Hardy and Leslie Picker. It's another strategic move by Lawrence J. Ellison, the software mogul who founded Oracle and remains its executive chairman, and who through personal and family holdings owns more than 40 percent of NetSuite. Mr. Ellison has been one of the biggest dealmakers in software for more than 15 years and this latest purchase further adds to that record. At the same time, another tech giant made waves in the enterprise computing world: Amazon. The Seattle e-commerce company on Thursday posted quarterly earnings, including more evidence that its cloud-computing business, Amazon Web Services, is a juggernaut, writes Nick Wingfield. Sales for A.W.S. jumped 58 percent from a year ago to $2.9 billion, and the business accounted for more than half of Amazon's operating income. Microsoft and Google have been trying hard to catch up to Amazon in the field. That's enough to keep at least some people awake."
0,2016-07-30," Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week's news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Mike: Ahoy, Farhad! What's new with you? Right now I'm watching my dog sleep and thinking if somehow my cryogenic life extension fails and I eventually die, I hope to be reincarnated as a Bernese mountain dog. All she does is sleep, eat and play. Farhad: That's an odd choice. I would much rather come back as a bird — and not just any bird, but one of those huge, mean, absolutely lethal birds of prey, something like an eagle or condor or falcon. When you're an eagle no one messes with you, least of all some silly mountain dog that can't even fly. Mike: Me as a dog will totally bark at you as an eagle. Moving on to tech news! So this week was tech company earnings week, or what I like to call boring hell week. It is not a lot of fun because it's a bunch of numbers and math, which is really not what I signed up for when deciding to enter journalism as a career. I studied Faulkner in college, not Fibonacci. Farhad: I don't believe that. You once told me ""The Sound and the Fury"" was your favorite U2 album. Mike: Saying I like U2 in a public newsletter is dangerously close to libel, sir. The good thing, I will grant, is that you get at least some insight into the health and well-being of how a public company is faring, something that we really aren't able to get — at least not that easily — when dealing with privately owned companies. So what happened this week? Twitter said it expected decelerating revenue growth in the months to come, and the stock tanked. Facebook also said it expected decelerating revenue growth in the months to come, but the stock went up like a rocket ship. Both companies are aggressively pursuing video as the messiah of how to increase advertising revenue in the years ahead. No one knows if either can really pull it off, but everyone thinks Facebook will do it because Facebook can do no wrong. Also, Google is still minting money, as is Amazon. And Amazon said it employs nearly 270,000 people, which is up 47 percent from last year. That's nuts, right? I can't think of many companies that do that. Farhad: At Microsoft, meanwhile, things are going the other way. In May the company said it would be cutting 1,850 jobs in its latest wave of layoffs; now in a new regulatory filing, Microsoft reports it will be laying off 2,850 more. Mike: And practically every chief executive mentioned Pokémon Go on their earnings calls, which was funny and predictable. Even Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have Pokémon fever. Or should I say, they're pandering to Pokémon players. Anything to capture that Wigglytuff voting base. Apparently Tim Cook doesn't even know how to properly pronounce Pokémon — he said something like ""pokey man"" — which probably threatened to hurt Apple's quarterly financials. Luckily, Apple didn't do as poorly as analysts expected, and the stock actually fared well. And by ""didn't do as poorly"" I mean they still made bazillions of dollars, as usual. Farhad: One thing they're doing with those bazillions: Making self-driving software for cars, according to Bloomberg. Apple's car project, known as Project Titan, has previously been devoted to building its own vehicle. But after lots of shifts in personnel, the company now seems to be trying to prioritize the autonomous car software. Apple still might also develop a car, Bloomberg reported, but it could establish partnerships with established car companies to realize its vision for the future of driving. Which sounds cool, but when I'm a peregrine falcon, I won't need to drive anywhere, because I'll be one of the fastest animals in the world. Mike: Yeah. In non-earnings news, folks are starting to think that the hackers who breached the Democratic National Committee may have been connected to the Russian government, which brings us full circle to the plot of ""The Americans"" on FX. O.K., now onto the big thing. Yahoo, the company I never think about except to say ""ha, ha, Yahoo,"" finally agreed to sell itself to Verizon for about $5 billion, a relative pittance compared to Yahoo's market cap in its heyday as one of the internet's premier companies. And thank God for it. If I had to read another Yahoo story I was gonna quit journalism. That said, I have an idea for its send-off from us. We should look at Yahoo not as a burning effigy to the god of irrelevance, but as a cautionary tale for tech companies of today, a history of how not to become something that, eventually, is sold only for the value of its parts rather than its potential. I'd like to hear your thoughts first, believe it or not. Farhad: I think Yahoo's failure offers one lesson above all for tech companies: Invest in technology. I know that sounds obvious, but it's one place where Yahoo totally missed the boat from the beginning. It started out in the 1990s as a guide to the web that was created by human beings. In other words, from its very inception, Yahoo was more of a media company than a tech company. And that origin story infected its culture — sure, it had lots of engineers and acquired lots of innovative tech, but at its core Yahoo never really saw itself as a company whose mission was to invent the next big thing. Notice how today's tech behemoths — Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook — offer a completely different outlook on the world. Each of these companies regards software and hardware as their essential areas of expertise, the basis from which they can spin out into so many different areas that are far beyond their primary businesses. Yahoo never really got that, and so, when the tech world changed, it failed. Mike: I really agree with this, mostly because I always like to see Wall Street's reaction to tech companies reporting quarterly losses. Maybe I'm brainwashed, but it's funny to hear people bemoan the death of innovation at companies and in the same breath criticize companies for spending heavily on research and development. I appreciate fiscal responsibility, but I think looking at a quarterly report without that appreciation is a bit shortsighted. I will give Marissa Mayer this: She seemed to recognize what you just said, how the industry had changed around Yahoo and it had failed to adapt to the times. And that was her mandate coming in as a product-and-engineering-oriented C.E.O.: Buy and build a bunch of consumer products to try to catch up to peers. Problem was, it was too late. Facebook owns photos, Google owns search, Apple owns mobile hardware and Amazon owns shopping. What was left for Yahoo? Basically what it had done for some time, which was become a sort of media company and portal, and that wasn't the path Mayer wanted to pursue, at least not fully. It's probably more nuanced than this, but we're out of time and I want to go lie in the grassy park with my dog. Till next week, Falco! I mean, Farhad! Farhad: See you. I hope you don't get fleas."
0,2016-08-01," Oracle Corporation may well be the single most important technology firm for businesses. Over 300,000 companies around the world use its database, and 100,000 customers have purchased its business applications. Even companies gunning for Oracle — like Amazon, Google and Salesforce — have used Oracle's technology. Why does that matter, though, in the world of cloud computing, and what will Oracle's approach look like? Perhaps like a Google search, only for every business decision. In a story I wrote, Thomas Kurian, who is building Oracle's cloud, talked about how the company is deploying its $9.3 billion purchase of NetSuite through its little-known global network of 21 cloud computing centers. That is only the start of what Mr. Kurian has in mind. Besides selling applications more efficiently, he said, Oracle has pooled a large amount of information derived from over 1,500 data providers. ""Marketers and brands find this very powerful,"" he said in an email, as Oracle targets ""over 45,000 different dimensions (demographic, geography, online and offline behavior)."" In other words, what Google and Facebook know based on your online life, as well as what companies learn from your shopping habits, credit and warranty behavior, among other things. Oracle will also have data on what customers do after an ad campaign, so advertisers can check the outcome of a Google ad blitz. The same data-heavy approach can be used in functions of business like procurement, human capital management, sales and service, Mr. Kurian thinks. ""We know how payrolls change around job titles, the rate of salary changes in Silicon Valley versus Bangalore, or how many people in a company are buying a $10 printer cartridge,"" he told me in an earlier interview. This data analysis could become a valuable adjunct to many of Oracle's database and applications businesses. Equally, it drives home how the competition in cloud computing is moving from cost savings — Amazon Web Services started by selling cheap computing and storage — to value creation through better insight. In that business, large amounts of data are a critical asset — what Mr. Kurian termed ""trying to be at the center of data gravity."" Oracle definitely has a place there, perhaps a better one than any company. Other elements of success will most likely include reliability, ease of use and price. Oracle may be challenged there, precisely because it has built a big and complicated system of databases, bigger than anything Amazon, Microsoft or Google sells. It has to keep those older customers happy, even as it makes data easier to move around, in and out of the cloud, for different kinds of analysis. In that, Oracle has a powerful and little-noted asset: Despite its reputation as a hard-edge company, it has good engineers with decades of experience. Employees fly in and out of Google or Facebook, but they seem to stay longer, on average, at Oracle. That can be an advantage when it comes to working on complex projects. ""Understanding complex software takes a year,"" Mr. Kurian said. ""Understanding the intentions behind it, which you need if you're going to adapt it, takes even longer."" Slow, steady and reliable may make people at the fast, young tech companies snicker. Even as Oracle's customers agree with Mr. Kurian's point."
0,2016-08-02," Travis Kalanick, the co-founder and chief executive of the ride-hailing giant Uber, often defended his eagerness to risk billions on winning the Chinese market with a simple question: If you have a chance to become Amazon and Alibaba at the same time, why not try? The implication was simple. Over the last couple of decades, Amazon, Facebook, Google and other American technology giants have each followed a similar script for world domination. Like an imperial armada rolling out from North America's West Coast, these companies would try to establish beachheads on every other continent. But when American giants tried to enter the waters of China, the world's largest internet market, the armada invariably ran aground. Plagued by opaque and ever-shifting regulations and a culturally abstruse way of doing business, American companies fell to a series of local giants. Instead of Google, Baidu. Instead of Facebook, WeChat, owned by the giant Tencent. And instead of Amazon, Alibaba. That has left us with a divide: Today, there is the Chinese internet, and there is the internet of the rest of the world. A network seen in its early days as a tool to foster financial and political unity across a fragmented planet has irrevocably cleaved into two completely separate spheres. Mr. Kalanick, a famously competitive and aggressive entrepreneur, had apparently studied these risks and seemed determined to bridge that gulf. He would try to take on China not as an afterthought, but as a central mission of his fledgling company. He would risk billions and spend a great deal of time in China to figure out the secrets of winning there. The goal seemed lofty, but the opportunity, after all, was eye-popping: Amazon has a market value of $365 billion, and Alibaba is worth about $200 billion. The ride-hailing business might one day grow to be as valuable as e-commerce, if not larger — and wouldn't it be fantastic if you could own it all, everywhere? Well, you can't. The announcement on Monday that Uber will sell its Chinese operations to its rival Didi Chuxing, effectively ceding China to the homegrown favorite, cements an emerging global state of play: A kind of Chinese-American Cold War over the internet. Entrepreneurs across the globe can choose to win in China or the rest of the world. You can be Alibaba or you can be Amazon. You can be Uber or you can be Didi. But you can't be both. Given the rising Chinese market and increasing tension over the role of American tech firms in the rest of the globe, the gulf between the two sides promises to become one of the most important factors in determining the shape of global tech innovation. How exactly might the war play out? In some ways, being at the mercy of two poles of internet leadership could be good for citizens of planet Earth. In emerging markets like India, the Middle East and parts of Africa and South America, the giants of China and the United States are increasingly investing billions to compete for local customers in e-commerce, social networking, ride sharing and other markets. For instance, Duncan Clark, an investment adviser in China who wrote ""Alibaba: The House That Jack Ma Built,"" pointed to the way Amazon and Alibaba act as foils for one another. ""Amazon is increasingly making its own branded products, taking on Procter & Gamble and others, and also getting into the logistics business, and shipping, and everything else,"" Mr. Clark said. ""But Alibaba is a marketplace that doesn't hold inventory and describes themselves as helping local merchants — so maybe there's some argument that Alibaba could serve as a counter globally to Amazon."" But Uber's deal with Didi — in which Uber will take an 18 percent stake in the combined company, which is certain to become the monopolistic player in the Chinese ride-hailing market — points to another potential outcome: A series of accommodationist deals in which giants cede large parts of the world to one another, pragmatically carving out their spheres of influence like players in The Great Game. ""In that way it could be like the Yalta Conference,"" said Mr. Clark, referring to the 1945 meeting in which the victors of World War II determined the postwar geopolitical order. However the global order shakes out, each side's home territory seems safe from invasion by the other. Uber's retreat in China was preceded by a parade of failures by earlier American tech firms. Some fell short for obvious political reasons — companies that traffic in information, like Google, Facebook and Twitter, were essentially stymied from the start by the Chinese censorship regime. Others, like Amazon and eBay, failed to appreciate some of the differences in how business got done in China, especially the importance of personal connections. Of all American tech firms, Apple has achieved the biggest success in China — about 25 percent of its sales occurred in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan in 2015. But in recent months, it, too, has been running into political hurdles in the region. ""The barrels that will be thrown at you when you're trying to do business in China will just never stop,"" said Mark Natkin, the managing director of Marbridge Consulting, an advisory firm based in Beijing. ""You'll constantly be above one barrel or recovering from jumping one, and as you're dusting yourself off you look down the road and here comes the next one."" Compared with previous failures, Uber seemed to do everything right in China. It set up a separate company, Uber China, which had a buy-in from local investors, including from a local giant, Baidu. It hired many local experts, and worked closely with the national government to foster friendly relations. Insiders say Mr. Kalanick was also personally invested in the deal. He visited China eight times in the last year and a half, and became something of a tech star in the Chinese media. Publicly Mr. Kalanick had insisted he was fighting for total victory in China. But he must have known that Uber would always struggle to achieve dominance, given the emerging centrality of ride-sharing to the future of infrastructure in China. Still, even if he failed to win everything in China, investing early in the country seemed too big to skip. ""The ride-sharing opportunity in China is basically as big as the rest of the world combined, if not bigger,"" said Ben Thompson, an analyst based in Taiwan who writes the tech newsletter Stratechery. ""For Uber, China was basically frosting on the cake."" For now, it's especially delicious frosting. The $2 billion Uber spent tackling China is now worth about $7 billion in the new merged entity; if Didi does become one of China's largest tech companies, the value of Uber's stake in China could rise geometrically, making the firm much more attractive in a potential initial public offering. Pulling out of China also frees up Uber to invest more in other markets — India and Indonesia are big targets — as well as expand its expertise in core technological initiatives like mapping data and self-driving cars. But if spending big to tackle China ultimately works out for Uber, it will be an anomaly, and certainly not a model for other American tech giants. ""The ride-sharing market is one the few markets where the upside is big enough to justify going in,"" Mr. Thompson said. ""For most other companies, going into China is still going to be nothing but pain."""
1,2016-08-02," Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. In this piece, Suzanne Daley, an associate editor for international print, describes the unexpected perils of her recent reporting adventure in the Amazon: Surprising an illegal gold-mining ring turned out to be the least of her worries. I braced myself when I realized the water was about to go over the top of my rubber boots. I had already spent hours working my way down a path in the Amazon jungle, traveling with Peruvian soldiers who were on a mission to close down illegal gold-mining operations. ""Take the step,"" I thought to myself. ""You have no choice anyhow. You can't turn around now. And it can't get much worse."" I was wrong. Soon, I was in swirling water up to my armpits, and I heard one of the soldiers ask whether I knew how to swim. It would take us another six hours to get out of there. None of this was part of my plan. My plan had been simple. Illegal gold miners were destroying Peru's Amazon jungle. The government was intent on shutting them down. I would go on a ride-along, swooping into the jungle in a helicopter filled with government agents whose mission was to surprise the miners, destroy their camps and put them out of business. By night fall, the helicopter would have me back to a semi-decent hotel, hot water and a good bed. I had pestered for months to get permission to see Peru's efforts to halt the army of illegal miners that was already turning patches of the Tambopata reserve, one of the most biologically diverse places on earth, into toxic wasteland. I wanted to see the fight up close, not just because such access is rare but because there is no substitute for being there. It offers an understanding that no amount of reading and talking with experts — or looking at detailed satellite photos — can make up for. It allows you to tell a story with a special kind of authority. Whatever the discomfort, it is usually worth the effort. And yet sometimes you have little insight into what's coming. The night before we were to go, photographer Tomas Munita and I got word that we would be traveling by road, mostly on motorbikes, and spending the night at a rangers outpost in a remote area along the Malinowski river. Still, I thought, I was traveling with soldiers. What could happen? Tomas and I went off to the local market to buy rubber boots and ponchos, choosing the thick expensive ones. I packed a change of clothes in a small gym bag that looked waterproof. Tomas suggested I pack everything inside in plastic bags, just in case — an idea that turned out to be brilliant. By 6 a.m., we were at the mouth of a trail. Only then did the rangers explain that they had just four working dirt bikes, and they intended to run a shuttle service for our group of about 12 people. Tomas (who had agreed to be my translator since I was not allowed to bring one) was hustled onto one of the bikes. I would not see him again for 11 hours. Those of us left behind were told to start walking. My group included a small band of armed soldiers and two young women less than half my age — one a ranger intern, the other their videographer. At first, there was plenty of chitchat, much of which I could not understand. But as the trail disappeared under water — and it became harder and harder to keep from slipping, tripping or falling into a hole — we moved in total silence. The loudest sound in the forest was the rain hitting leaves, hard. Gangs controlled the other ""roads,"" and there was a possibility we would be ambushed even here, a factor that was in the back of my mind. But soon the conditions were so bad that an attack seemed a very remote possibility. I was more worried about broken legs, snakebites, parasites and other gross things. No one had a radio. Our cellphones didn't work. And it was clear that no bikes would be coming back to get us. I was in one of the most beautiful settings on earth. But that fact intruded on my thoughts only occasionally. We walked for nine and a half hours, mostly in water. The poncho turned out to be porous. The new boots, soaking wet, were heavy and began to kill my toes. I had expected heat. But the water was cold. I was shivering. As with every other time I have ended up in a dangerous situation while reporting, my mind went over and over where I had made the stupid mistake that had landed me in such a spot. Eventually, some of the rangers who had gone ahead on bikes waded back to help us out of there. Perhaps because I was old enough to be their mother, the soldiers and rangers seemed unsure of how to deal with me. But one finally offered me his hand. I wondered later whether he regretted it. I did not let go of him for at least two hours as he inched forward first, trying to guide me to solid footing. Over the next two days (yes, one night turned into two) I watched these young men work so hard to do their job right. Some showed a deep knowledge and love of the rain forest they were trying to protect. But it was a shock to see how poorly equipped and vastly outmanned they were. Most spoke not a word of English. But even so, as I slipped down the 15-foot muddy embankment to get into a motorized canoe or got my boots stuck in the quicksand-like beach along the river, one of them always seemed there to hold my hand. My Fitbit didn't survive the soaking. The clothes I wore and slept in were so stained with gooey muck that they would go straight into the garbage. I am in the process of losing one of my toe nails. But as we headed for a different path home, I knew I had gotten what I wanted for my story. Going up the river away from the miners, we were in a still-pristine area. There, at dawn, we spotted a jaguar in the water swimming from shore to shore. The men turned off the boat engine to watch as the animal climbed out on a pebbly stretch. Then they burst out laughing. Our jaguar was fat. In this area of the reserve, at least for now, all was well."
0,2016-08-03," Jet.com was born out of a dream of taking on Amazon and its grip on the world of e-commerce. But the online discount retailer may instead be poised for a humbling sale to the biggest traditional store chain around. Jet.com is in talks to sell itself to Walmart, two people briefed on the matter said on Wednesday. The talks are continuing and may not lead to a deal. A Walmart representative declined to comment on the talks, which were reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal. A Jet.com representative also declined to comment. The discussions are an acknowledgment of the tough reality of America's $350 billion e-commerce market, which has for years been dominated by Amazon. While plenty of competitors — including physical retailers and online start-ups — have tried to take on Amazon with strategies like focusing only on specific niches of the market or having flash sales, none have succeeded. Of all that have tried, few have been seen as anti-Amazon as Marc Lore, Jet.com's founder, has. An entrepreneur who previously founded the parent company of Diapers.com and later sold it to Amazon for $550 million, Mr. Lore and Jet.com were featured on the cover of Bloomberg Businessweek in January 2015 — before Jet.com had made a single sale — with the headline ""Amazon Bought Marc Lore's Company. Now He's Coming for Them."" From offices in Hoboken, N.J., Jet.com tried to chart a different course in the e-commerce market. It attacked Amazon directly, seeking to build a national network of warehouses while offering a similarly broad selection of goods. But it also sought to undercut Amazon on price, using complex formulas that adjust the cost of items based on factors like the quantity of products bought at once. For an annual membership fee of $50, Jet.com consumers could get access to goods priced 10 to 15 percent less than anywhere else on the web. Mr. Lore also tried to make Jet.com different from other start-ups at the workplace. Most start-ups try to bend a reluctant universe to their will, which means employees sweat 12-hour days and seven-day weeks. Private lives go by the wayside. But Jet promoted itself as a start-up with a difference: one focused on employee well-being. ""I'm constantly asking people at Jet if they're happy,"" Mr. Lore said in an interview last fall. ""It's really important for me to know that they love working here and think this is the best place they've ever worked."" His approach in e-commerce and the workplace may have seemed quixotic, but Mr. Lore succeeded in raising more than $500 million from many investors, including venture capital firms like New Enterprise Associates and the mutual fund company Fidelity. Jet.com quickly gained a valuation of roughly $1 billion. Along the way, it was hailed as a particularly ambitious ""unicorn,"" the once-ballyhooed class of Silicon Valley start-ups valued at $1 billion or more. But Jet.com has struggled. In an interview  in mid-2015, Mr. Lore predicted that the company would take five years to reach a point where it was not losing money on every shipment. In the meantime, it was spending the cash it raised from investors as it expanded its staff and spent millions on marketing. Last October, Jet.com dropped its membership fee. Mr. Lore said in a blog post at the time that he was ""enabling even more people to embrace this new way of shopping"" by removing the fee. A month later, after Jet.com had finished a fund-raising round, Mr. Lore said: ""It was challenging. The market conditions have turned, and there is a lot of negative press around private company financing. The fact that we got it done was on the back of the company's performance."" For Walmart, pursuing Jet.com in what would be one of its biggest takeovers, a deal would help the retailer reproduce its off-line dominance in the online world. The Bentonville, Ark., company has pumped millions of dollars into efforts to expand its e-commerce business, such as offering more items online and expanding locations for its grocery pickup service. At the end of 2015, Walmart had about eight million items available at Walmart.com. That's now up to 10 million. Four years ago, it was under two million, Walmart has said. The retailer does not break out a quarterly figure for online sales, but it said its e-commerce business had grown 7 percent in the last quarter. Still, Doug McMillon, WalMart's president and chief executive, said in May that progress had been ""too slow."" Shoppers continue to shop overwhelmingly at Amazon, which accounts for more than half of all dollars spent online. Walmart recently announced a two-day subscription shipping service for $49, its version of Amazon's $99 annual Prime membership. Walmart is also trying to take advantage of its position as the nation's largest grocer, nearly tripling the number of markets where customers can order groceries and pick up curbside. Jet's model of encouraging bulk buying would complement Walmart in areas where the retailer has lagged, according to Neil Saunders, a retail analyst with Conlumino, a research and consulting firm. A decade ago, consumers might have been more inclined to stop at Walmart for household items like toilet paper and laundry detergent in ""fairly reasonable quantities"" and pick up other items while they were there, Mr. Saunders said. ""What's happened, though, with these online sites is that people first of all are much more likely to buy in bulk because they can get better deals,"" he said."
0,2016-08-04," Walmart may be trying to hasten its pursuit of Amazon by acquiring an e-commerce start-up. The retail titan is said to be in talks to buy Jet.com, a fledgling online shopping site, a move that would fit into a bigger plan to enhance its lackluster digital and e-commerce efforts, while Amazon keeps moving ahead with new products and services, like one-day shipping and grocery delivery. Doug McMillon, Walmart's president and chief executive, has no illusions about how his company is faring on the web. ""Growth here is too slow,"" he said in May. Online sales clocked in at about $14 billion last year, barely 3 percent of Walmart's top line. Amazon, by comparison, reported a revenue increase of about one-fifth in 2015 to $100 billion, excluding web services. It also was about a year ago that Amazon charged past Walmart in terms of market value. At $350 billion, it is now 60 percent larger. Walmart lags in other areas, too. Its marketplace that allows consumers to sell their products next to Walmart's own has more than 10 million items. Amazon counts 200 million, according to Jefferies. What's more, Amazon is considering turf once claimed by Walmart. It recently expanded the markets in which it delivers fresh food such as milk and produce. Given Walmart's ambitions, Jet understandably makes for a tempting target. Marc Lore, one of the founders of Jet, also helped start the company behind Diapers.com, which Amazon bought in 2010. Introduced just last year, Jet has been struggling to challenge its larger online rival; already, it has changed its business model. Jet first required a $50 annual membership fee in a bid to mimic the successful Costco structure online. It dropped the idea, however, and turned its attention to other ways to generate revenue. Walmart has been rapidly acquiring start-ups over the last couple of years, including Yumprint, a recipe and meal-planning service, and Adchemy, an advertising technology specialist. Jet would be a bigger acquisition. It has raised more than $500 million and is valued at more than $1 billion. Walmart can afford to buy as it builds, but even a galloping ""unicorn,"" as start-ups valued at more than $1 billion are known, will struggle to tow the lumbering retailer into a competitive position online."
0,2016-08-06," It was around 10 a.m. on a sun-drenched summer morning, and James Altucher, perhaps the world's least likely success guru, was packing his worldly possessions, about 15 items, into a small canvas carry-on bag. ""If I were to die, my kids get this bag,"" Mr. Altucher said sardonically as he packed away his laptop, iPad, three sets of chinos, three T-shirts and a Ziploc bag filled with $4,000 worth of $2 bills (""People always remember you if you tip with $2 bills,"" he said), and departed a friend's loft on East 20th Street. A few months ago, the boyish 48-year-old let the lease expire on his Cold Spring, N.Y., apartment, and dumped or donated virtually everything he owned, more than 40 garbage bags of sheets, dishes, clothes, books, his college diploma, even childhood photo albums. Since then, he's been bouncing among friends' apartments and Airbnb rentals. It is not that he is down on his luck. Several of the 16 books he has written, including his 2013 personal-empowerment manifesto, ""Choose Yourself,"" continue to sell briskly. His weekly podcasts, ""The James Altucher Show,"" featuring interviews with notables as diverse as Ron Paul and Luther Campbell of 2 Live Crew, and ""Question of the Day,"" with Stephen Dubner, are downloaded about two million times a month. Mr. Altucher is simply practicing what he preaches. Over the last half-decade, this former tech entrepreneur, venture capitalist and financial pundit has reinvented himself as a gimlet-eyed self-help guru, preaching survival in an era when the American Dream — the gold-embossed college diploma, the corner office, the three-bedroom home — seems like a sham. So one by one, he has shed all of them. ""I have ambition,"" he said, ""to have no ambition.""  ""In the past 25 years, income has gone down for the 18-to-35-year-olds, student loan debt is at an all-time high,"" Mr. Altucher said over a lunch of zucchini pancakes at a Russian restaurant in the Flatiron district. ""We had $3 trillion in bailout money, and income inequality got higher than ever. People feel like they were scammed."" Mr. Altucher's diagnosis will come as no surprise to the anxious middle class, the downsized and the dispossessed who have propelled the angry populism of Bernie Sanders and Donald J. Trump. But while there is no shortage of anger and confusion about the supposed waning of the American Dream, what makes Mr. Altucher stand out are his Cassandra-like conclusions. College, he says, is a waste of money. Although he graduated from Cornell, Mr. Altucher argues that the college degree has become a costly luxury in a world where millennials feel like debt serfs and entry-level professional jobs are scarce. In a 2012 self-published book, ""40 Alternatives to College,"" he argued that young adults could travel the world, educate themselves online and start a business with the same $200,000 they may spend on college. Investing the money with even a 5 percent return would offer greater financial benefit over the course of a lifetime, he wrote in a  blog post. Similarly, he believes homeownership is a rip-off foisted upon unwitting citizens by a $14 trillion mortgage industry. ""It's a total scam,"" he said in an online interview. ""Nobody should put more than 5 to 10 percent of their portfolio, their assets, in any one investment. But when people buy a home, they go crazy. They put like 50, 60, 70 percent of their net worth into this one investment. It's illiquid, so when times are hard, you can't sell it."" And he think stocks are a racket. It's a fierce worldview that is rooted in Mr. Altucher's own roller-coaster life.  In the 1990s, as a young Silicon Alley start-up whiz, Mr. Altucher made millions with a web-design company, Reset Inc., that counted Sony and Miramax as clients. Soon, he and his wife at the time, Anne (they divorced in 2010), were living in a 5,000-square-foot loft in TriBeCa that he bought for $1.8 million and spent another $1 million renovating. He felt flush enough to take a helicopter to Atlantic City on weekends to play poker. The lavish lifestyle did not fill his emotional void. ""Nobody should feel sorry for me,"" he said. ""I was really stupid, but I thought I was dirt poor. I felt like I needed $100 million to be happy. So I just started investing in all these other companies, and they were just stupid companies. Zero of these investments worked out."" As his fortunes collapsed, he was forced to sell his apartment for a $1 million loss (it was after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001). To reclaim his wealth, he set his sights on the stock market. He read more than a hundred books on investing, and eventually wrangled a job writing for James Cramer's site, TheStreet, and later The Financial Times. Before long, his trademark hairdo, which looks like carnival cotton candy spun from steel wool, was a familiar sight on CNBC. But his fortunes crumbled once again during the financial crisis that began in 2008. The hedge fund he started ran out of gas, various start-ups withered, writing gigs dried up. With few options open, he decided to chronicle his failures on a personal blog, which he named Altucher Confidential. ""I just said, 'I've made every mistake in the book: Here's what they are,'"" Mr. Altucher said. To Wall Street friends, he seemed like Howard Beale, the anchorman in ""Network"" who had a meltdown on-air. Instead of touting the latest hot mutual fund, he wrote posts like ""10 Reasons You Should Never Own Stocks Again."" (Reason No. 1: You're not that good at it.) He confessed thoughts of suicide. ""Financial people were like watching a train wreck in real time,"" Mr. Altucher said. ""I had friends I hadn't talked to since high school call me and say, 'Hey, are you O.K.?'"" He soon discovered a sizable audience of people whose own dreams had just gone down the sinkhole. They, too, were looking to claw their way out.  ""The No. 1 search phrase on Google that takes people to my blog is 'I want to die,'"" Mr. Altucher said. But Mr. Altucher seems like an unlikely person to look to for solace. Bookish, contrarian and given to speaking in staccato bursts, this skinny computer geek from North Brunswick, N.J., is like the anti-Anthony Robbins, the strapping self-help star. His regular-guy appearance turned out to be a plus, as he developed a following blogging about his win-some-lose-some ""life hacker"" experiments. There was ""the 5 p.m. diet,"" in which he eats nothing after that time (""Your face gets more angular. I've seen it happen. Not just with me. With everyone on this pseudo-Paleo diet""). There was ""the alien trick"" to beat anxiety, in which he pretends to be an alien and wake up every day on another planet with a new body (""I have no worries because tomorrow I will be in a new body. No envies. No worries. Only new things to explore""). There was his zombie email gimmick, when he would respond to unread emails from seven years ago: ""Sure! I'll have coffee today"" (""People laugh and all is forgiven,"" he said). By writing candidly about his own triumphs and flameouts, Mr. Altucher ""shows readers how they can succeed despite their flaws, not because of a lack of flaws,"" said Tim Ferriss, author of the best-selling ""4-Hour"" self-improvement series. ""This is hugely refreshing in a world of rah-rah positive-thinking gurus who are all forced smiles and high-fives."" It helped that Mr. Altucher, despite his biting views on topics like college, maintained a positive tone. ""I am an optimist,"" he said. ""There's a great novel from the '60s by Richard Fariña called 'Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me.' Basically, I've been down on the floor so many times, I know now that I can always bounce back, and it gets faster each time."" His philosophy is perhaps most clearly articulated in ""Choose Yourself,"" which he summarized over lunch like this: ""If you don't choose the life you want to live, chances are, someone else is going to choose it for you. And the results are probably not going to be pretty."" Chapters include ""How to Be Less Stupid"" (""I lose at least 20 percent of my intelligence when I am resentful"") and ""The Seven Habits of Highly Effective Mediocre People"" (procrastination, he writes, ""is your body telling you that you need to back off a bit and think more about what you are doing""). A key tenet of the book is the Daily Practice, a wellness regimen that comprises the physical (eat well, try to go to sleep by 9 p.m. and rise by 5 a.m., break a sweat for at least 10 minutes a day), emotional (be around people you love, who love you), mental (write a list of 10 ideas each day to exercise the ""idea muscle"" before it atrophies) and spiritual (feel gratitude every day). He calls them the four pillars of happiness. ""A chair needs four legs to be stable,"" he said. And there has never been a better time to choose yourself, he said. You do not have to be Mark Zuckerberg, he said, to be an entrepreneur. ""You can learn basic web development,"" he said. ""You can go to Codecademy.com, learn the basic skills in three months, then sell them on Freelancer.com, where there are millions of jobs. I know 15-year-olds who are making a few thousand dollars a month."" Thanks to self-publishing, you don't have to be Deepak Chopra to write books. ""Everybody is or can be an expert on something,"" he said. ""Take me: I haven't been in the kitchen in 20 years. I hate eating vegan. But how hard would it be to read every book on veganism, buy some ingredients, write up a little book: 'The Non-Vegan's Vegan Cookbook'?"" He would know. ""Choose Yourself,"" which Mr. Altucher self-published on Amazon, sold more than a half-million copies, he said, and made The Wall Street Journal's best-seller list. His fans swear by him. One reader, Beck Power, recently wrote an essay on Medium about how he inspired her to ditch a frustrating job to start her own online travel business. ""I dance in my underwear,"" she wrote. ""I don't have panic attacks anymore."" A talk he gave at a London church last year drew about 1,000 people, and fans have organized ""Choose Yourself"" meetups in cities around the world. On LinkedIn, where he publishes original free essays, Mr. Altucher has more than 485,000 followers and is ranked the No. 4 ""influencer,"" after Bill Gates, Richard Branson and Mohamed A. El-Erian, the financier and author. ""He's the Oprah of the internet,"" said Kamal Ravikant, a tech entrepreneur who wrote the self-published Amazon best seller ""Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends on It."" Unlike most gurus, ""James is on a very personal journey, allowing his readers and listeners to experience it in real time,"" said Brian Koppelman, a creator of Showtime's ""Billions,"" who also moderates ""The Moment,"" a podcast on Slate. ""He's telling you the story on Saturday, on Sunday he's talking about how it failed, and on Monday he's talking about doing it a different way."" Mr. Altucher, in fact, disputes that he is a guru in the first place. ""I am not a self-help guy at all,"" he said. ""Advice is autobiography,"" he added. ""I only say what has worked for me, and then others can choose to try it or not."" Besides, what worked yesterday may not work tomorrow. ""It's like Mike Tyson says,"" Mr. Altucher said. ""'Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.'"""
1,2016-08-06," Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon have created something of a watershed moment in the stock market. They became the four most valuable companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index at the close of trading on Aug. 1, according to S.&P.'s official tally. That meant that tech companies, by one common definition, occupied the four top spots in the market capitalization rankings, a rare and brief occurrence. ""It may never have happened before at the close of trading,"" said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. The full history of daily rankings isn't readily available, however, so we can't be certain, and such rankings are evanescent, shifting with every tick of the stock market. In fact, on Friday, Amazon dropped back into sixth place. But no matter: The early August rankings were a reminder of how far tech has come. It is a dominant force in the stock market and the economy, one so all-encompassing that tech may no longer even be a useful concept for understanding today's stock market. First, consider the prosaic but consequential details leading to the Aug. 1 market shift. Tech companies have been moving upward in the rankings since the start of the bull market in March 2009, but recent earnings reports have accelerated matters. On July 28, Amazon issued a very strong report, which provided the impetus for its rise, in market cap, past two venerable companies, which regained their fourth and fifth place berths on Friday afternoon. One of them is Exxon Mobil, the energy giant and the most valuable company in the S.&P. as recently as 2012. But Exxon Mobil has been cut down in size by the oil price debacle. The other is Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett's conglomerate, which the S.&P. categorizes as a financial services company — the only such company left in the Top 10 market cap list. Berkshire announced its own earnings after trading closed on Friday. We'll soon learn whether the market is pleased enough to vault Berkshire further ahead of Amazon. The three tech companies at the very top in market cap — Apple, Google and Microsoft — have held high positions for a long while. (Google, ranked second, trades as Alphabet, the name of its parent company.) Google passed Apple in value briefly this year, but Apple regained the top perch, which it has held since 2012. Microsoft, now No. 3, was the most valuable company during the last tech boom, in the early 2000s. Virtually no one disputes S.&P.'s formal classification of Apple, Google and Microsoft as ""information technology"" companies. The same is true of Facebook, which held seventh place in the latest list of most valuable companies. But while Amazon is often described as a tech company — and undoubtedly uses and creates innovative technology — S.&P. has never classified it as one. In fact, Amazon is formally known as a ""consumer discretionary company,"" like Walmart, which it has displaced as a member of the Top 10 most valuable companies. Amazon is the only consumer discretionary company left in the Top 10. Is it in some sense a tech company? Certainly, and we'll get back to that. But the same can be said, to one degree or another, about the three other members of the Top 10 — old companies that are still prospering in large part because of their mastery of advanced technologies. Johnson & Johnson, for example, which is ranked eighth, is a health care company, yet it is heavily involved in technology of a biological kind. Then there is General Electric, the diversified industrial company (and, until recently, also a financial services company), once described as a bellwether for the entire market. It conducts advanced research and sells tech products. Last on the list is AT&T, a telecommunications company, which, in an early form, helped create computer languages and operating systems on which modern tech companies are built. In 1957, when the S.&P. 500 was born, an ancestral version of AT&T was the most valuable company in the United States by a very wide margin, said Jeremy J. Siegel, a Wharton business school professor, the author of ""Stocks for the Long Run"" and a market historian. ""AT&T back then was a highly regulated old phone company,"" he says. ""It was a giant, later broken up into smaller companies. And it was an outlier, because the other big companies in the S.&P. 500 in that era were mainly materials companies — like United States Steel, DuPont and Union Carbide — and an awful lot of oil companies."" In 1957, the economy ran on oil, and the biggest energy company was Standard Oil of New Jersey — an ancestor of Exxon Mobil. No pure tech company ranked in the Top 10 back then, not even IBM, which soon became the dominant tech company, a position it held until Microsoft surpassed it in the mid-1990s. That was the decade of the great tech boom, culminating in the bubble that burst in March 2000. Microsoft was No. 1 in market cap at the end of 1999, and four other tech companies — Cisco Systems, Intel, IBM and America Online — were also among the Top 10 most valuable companies. The stock market celebrated tech's ascendance then, as it does now. But this is a different era. When you dig deeper into the S.&P. 500, it's clear that while the valuations of tech companies swelled to unrealistically high proportions in those bubble years, the valuations of most companies are far more modest now. In March 2000, the height of the bubble, the value of information technology companies swelled to 34.5 percent of the total market cap of the S.&P. 500. At the moment, the comparable figure is only 20.7 percent, data from the Bespoke Investment Group shows. That's not much more than the 15.7 percent share of financial companies or the 15.2 percent share of the health care sector. By contrast, finance ballooned as high as 22.3 percent at the end of 2006, in what can be seen in hindsight as a financial bubble. On the other hand, materials and energy companies, which together constituted almost half of the total value of the S.&P. 500 in 1957, now account for less than 10 percent of it. That reflects the collapse of energy and commodity prices over the last few years, and it may well be a temporary phenomenon. In the meantime, diversified energy companies like Exxon Mobil are investing heavily in technology, a necessity if they are to flourish. It's clear even to energy companies, in other words, that tech's abiding power in the marketplace is not temporary. Technology permeates every sector of the economy, even those not formally classified as high-tech. Whether companies like Amazon and Johnson & Johnson should carry tech labels is beside the point. Tech has already taken over. These days every company is a tech company, but some have better niches, faster growth, more attractive offerings or more favorable share prices than others. These kinds of fundamental distinctions will influence the Top 10 rankings of the future."
0,2016-08-07," SEATTLE — Amazon surprised a lot of people when its Echo, a $180 so-called smart speaker, became a hit, giving them a novel way to play music, turn on the lights in their homes and set thermostats with voice commands. Amazon, though, has much bigger plans for the technology behind Echo. It wants the Alexa Voice Service, which powers Echo, to be an ingredient in devices around the home and beyond, even if they aren't made by Amazon. The vision of an omnipresent intelligent assistant is one Amazon shares, in one form or another, with most other big technology companies, including Apple, Google and Microsoft. Along with a handful of start-ups, these companies see their intelligent assistants as powerful new ways for users to interact with devices and internet services — just as smartphone touch screens were. Many technology specialists think that people will be O.K. with a single intelligent assistant in their lives but that most won't have the patience to regularly use two or three of them, each with its individual quirks. As a result, each company is racing to weave its assistant into as many devices and services as possible. Amazon, for example, wants Alexa to be a part of products like Nucleus, a smart-intercom system with a touch screen and a camera that went on sale last week for $249 (or $199 each if you buy two or three at once). Nucleus owners can have Alexa play music and read a weather forecast through the device. In a phone interview, Jonathan Frankel, the chief executive of Nucleus, said that adding Alexa to Nucleus was a no-brainer because it made the device far more useful. ""We're taking $180 worth of utility and adding it into a $200 device,"" he said. So far, a handful of smaller companies have released or promised to release products with Alexa built into them. There's Triby, a portable speaker; CoWatch, a smartwatch; and Pebble Core, a wireless wearable device by the maker of the Pebble smartwatch. Ford Motor is working with Amazon to integrate Alexa into its vehicles so drivers can control smart-home features like lights, thermostats and security systems from their cars. Over 10,000 developers have registered to integrate Alexa into their products, Amazon said. It won't say how many Echo units it has sold, except to say that millions of devices with Alexa in them have been purchased. John MacFarlane, the chief executive of Sonos, another well-known device maker, hinted in a blog post this year that Sonos was working on a way to play music through its speakers using Alexa voice control. In an interview this spring, David Limp, Amazon's senior vice president for devices, said that the company wanted there to be as many Alexa-linked ""endpoints"" around the home as possible and that Amazon did not really care who made those devices. Amazon has expanded its lineup of devices that use Alexa with its Echo Dot, a miniature version of the Echo speaker, and Amazon Tap, a portable Bluetooth speaker. ""The longer-term vision is a little bit like the 'Star Trek' computer,"" Mr. Limp said. ""Captain Kirk or Picard could sit on the bridge and ask anything and get the right answer."" But while Amazon has made a lot of progress in this regard, it may have a hard time extending Alexa's reach outside the home because of its weaknesses in mobile technology, analysts say. The success of Echo has been described as a redemption of sorts for Amazon after it suffered a brutal defeat in the smartphone market with its Fire Phone, which the company stopped selling after poor sales — a misstep that has left Amazon vulnerable. Apple and Google have clear advantages over Amazon because of their dominant positions in the mobile market. And they are pushing their versions of Alexa — Siri and Google's assistant — as ways to control other devices throughout the home. Apple has a technology called HomeKit that allows people to control thermostats, light switches and other devices with Siri from Apple devices. Google has announced plans for an Echo-like home speaker called Google Home. As intelligent assistants improve in quality, Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research, thinks people will want these virtual helpers to follow them all day like a companion. ""What you want from an assistant is that they are always available to you everywhere,"" he said. While Amazon could eventually give people access to Alexa's functions through apps on smartphones (a couple of apps from independent developers do this already), Mr. Dawson is skeptical that Amazon will be able to make them work as well as assistants more deeply integrated into smartphones by Apple and Google. ""They're basically absent on smartphones, which are devices we take everywhere we go,"" he said."
0,2016-08-08," Traditional retailers have spent more than a decade and billions of dollars trying to transform their brick-and-mortar businesses for the online shopper. Yet Amazon and other digital upstarts continue to lap them. Now Walmart, the world's largest retailer and the dominant player of big-box stores, is turning to someone else's technology and talent. On Monday, the company said it was buying Jet, the year-old online bulk retailer, for $3.3 billion, the largest deal ever for an e-commerce company. The purchase, and a shuffling in the executive ranks that comes with it, are Walmart's clearest acknowledgments yet that its online strategy is not working. It also sends a strong message to the rest of the consumer and retail industry: When it comes to competing against Amazon, not even the mightiest brick-and-mortar stores can go at it alone. ""The other retailers are going to be looking up to it and saying, 'You know, absolutely, we've been failing at doing this,'"" said Jharonne Martis, a retail analyst at Thomson Reuters. ""Bringing in an expert might be the key to it."" Over all, Walmart's e-commerce sales have stalled. The online business grew just 7 percent last quarter, a number that Doug McMillon, the company's president and chief executive, acknowledged at the time was ""too slow."" Most recently, the company has focused much of its online strategy on expanding its curbside grocery pickup business. Jet is perhaps best known for an algorithm that encourages bulk buying, an area where Walmart.com has fallen short and could energize its sagging online growth. Walmart said Jet offered it access to ""urban and millennial customers,"" two groups that the retailer's large rural footprint has been slow to attract. Walmart said on Monday that Jet had added more than 400,000 users monthly. Jet says it uses a complex formula to offer items 10 to 15 percent less than competitors by adjusting prices based on the quantity of products bought at once. The company relies heavily on suppliers, and Walmart offers more pricing power and potentially better distribution operations through its vast network of warehouses across the country. Still, the $3.3 billion figure is eye-popping, given that Jet.com started selling products barely a year ago. Walmart is not valuing Jet.com solely based on traditional metrics like profitability, which the start-up does not have. The retailer is spending billions in cash and stock in large part for something — or someone — else: Marc Lore. Mr. Lore, a serial e-commerce entrepreneur who started Jet.com, is seen as one of the few executives who can help put a dent in Amazon's edge. ""If you looked at Jet from a fundamentals perspective, the company wouldn't be worth what they're paying for it,"" said Anand Sanwal, the chief executive of CB Insights, a research firm covering venture capital. ""They're trying to inject Marc and probably some of the veterans on his team, and try and help Walmart figure this out."" Mr. Lore, 46, will take over responsibility for Walmart.com in the United States and will continue running Jet, which will operate separately, Mr. McMillon said in a call with reporters. Walmart will be ""thoughtful"" about how it merges the two companies, and will focus on expanding both brands in the short-term, he said. Mr. Lore will replace Walmart's current top e-commerce executive, Neil Ashe, who will leave the company. Mr. McMillon said that now was the ""natural inflection point"" for a leadership change and praised Mr. Ashe for doing an ""outstanding"" job building the company's online business. Mr. Lore co-founded a company, Quidsi, that grew into a collection of e-commerce websites, including Diapers.com and Soap.com. The company was sold to Amazon in 2010 for more than $500 million. He stayed at Amazon for two years, then left to figure out a new project. Investors lined up to back Mr. Lore on his next venture, Jet.com. He raised more than $200 million before the company sold a single product, and more than $500 million over all. In the latest funding in November, the company was valued at $1.5 billion, according to data compiled by CB Insights. He is seen as someone who can bring a unique approach when it comes to e-commerce, according to Adam Silverman, an analyst at Forrester, a research firm. ""Marc has been a creative force within the industry, creating pretty innovative business models, including Jet.com,"" Mr. Silverman said in a phone interview. ""He's proven that he can create businesses from scratch, and Walmart needs a bit of that entrepreneurship within their e-commerce business."" Recently, though, Jet.com has struggled. The company has been quickly burning through much of the cash it has raised, spending freely on hiring and marketing. To attract new customers, it dropped its annual $50 membership fee. The strategy has caused Jet.com to lose money on every shipment, something that would not have been reversed for another five years, Mr. Lore predicted in a 2015 interview. Connecting with Walmart could help Jet.com amplify its business without the stress of private fund-raising in a market that has become more challenging for unprofitable companies. Under the terms of the deal, Walmart will pay $3 billion in cash, a portion of which will be distributed to Jet.com stakeholders over time, while $300 million will be paid in Walmart stock over time, according to a statement released by the companies on Monday. Walmart said that while it would incorporate some of Jet's ideas and talent into Walmart.com, Jet would remain a separate brand, too. Yet both sites will continue to face a daunting reality: Amazon.com continues to wallop the competition. Amazon does more business online than any other retailer, yet still reports double-digit growth. In 2015, Amazon reported that net product sales rose 13 percent to $79.3 billion, while Walmart reported that global annual e-commerce revenue had risen 12 percent, to $13.7 billion, in its latest fiscal year. For Walmart, buying Jet may not be about beating Amazon at its own game, according to Charlie O'Shea, the lead retail analyst for Moody's. ""We view this as a race for second,"" Mr. O'Shea said. ""Amazon's lead is so great that it's going to be virtually impossible to catch them, but you can compete with them."" While legacy retailers continue to struggle with how best to compete online, e-commerce represents only 8 percent of all sales, Mr. O'Shea said. ""All Walmart has to do is be better than the other brick-and-mortar guys,"" he said."

0,2016-08-10," Amazon is the most obscure large company in the tech industry. It isn't just secretive, the way Apple is, but in a deeper sense, Jeff Bezos' e-commerce and cloud-storage giant is opaque. Amazon rarely explains either its near-term tactical aims or its long-term strategic vision. It values surprise. To understand Amazon, then, is necessarily to engage in a kind of Kremlinology. That's especially true of the story behind one of its most important business areas: the logistics by which it ships orders to its customers. Over the last few years, Amazon has left a trail of clues suggesting that it is radically altering how it delivers goods. Among other moves, it has set up its own fleet of trucks; introduced an Uber-like crowdsourced delivery service; built many robot-powered warehouses; and continued to invest in a far-out plan to use drones for delivery. It made another splash last week, when it showed off an Amazon-branded Boeing 767 airplane, one of more than 40 in its planned fleet. These moves have fueled speculation that Amazon is trying to replace the third-party shipping companies it now relies on — including UPS, FedEx and the United States Postal Service — with its homegrown delivery service. Its logistics investments have also fed the general theory that Amazon has become essentially unbeatable in American e-commerce — no doubt one reason Walmart, the world's largest retailer, felt the need this week to acquire an audacious Amazon rival, Jet.com, for $3.3 billion. So what's Amazon's ultimate aim in delivery? After talking to analysts, partners and competitors, and prying some very minimal input from Amazon itself, I suspect the company has a two-tiered vision for the future of shipping. First, it's not trying to replace third-party shippers. Instead, over the next few years, Amazon wants to add as much capacity to its operations as possible, and rather than replace partners like UPS and FedEx, it is spending boatloads on planes, trucks, crowdsourcing and other novel delivery services to add to its overall capacity and efficiency. Amazon's longer-term goal is more fantastical — and, if it succeeds, potentially transformative. It wants to escape the messy vicissitudes of roads and humans. It wants to go fully autonomous, up in the sky. The company's drone program, which many in the tech press dismissed as a marketing gimmick when Mr. Bezos unveiled it on ""60 Minutes"" in 2013, is central to this future; drones could be combined with warehouses manned by robots and trucks that drive themselves to unlock a new autonomous future for Amazon. There are hurdles to realizing this vision. Drone delivery in the United States faces an uncertain regulatory future, and there are myriad technical and social problems to iron out. Still, experts I consulted said that a future populated with autonomous drones is closer at hand than one populated with self-driving cars. ""It's a vastly easier problem — flying than driving,"" said Keller Rinaudo, the co-founder of Zipline, a drone-delivery start-up that will begin deploying a system to deliver medical goods in Rwanda this fall. ""If we had regulatory permission, we'd be delivering to your house right now,"" he added, referring to the San Francisco Bay Area. If Amazon's drone program succeeds (and Amazon says it is well on track), it could fundamentally alter the company's cost structure. A decade from now, drones would reduce the unit cost of each Amazon delivery by about half, analysts at Deutsche Bank projected in a recent research report. If that happens, the economic threat to competitors would be punishing — ""retail stores would cease to exist,"" Deutsche's analysts suggested, and we would live in a world more like that of ""The Jetsons"" than our own. Shipping has always been at the core of Amazon's strategic investments. In its earliest days, as part of an effort to avoid collecting sales tax from most customers, Amazon purposefully placed warehouses in low-tax, low-population states, and then shipped goods to populous areas within three to five days. The 2005 introduction of Amazon's Prime subscription program, which gives customers two-day delivery on many goods for an annual price of $99, changed Amazon's shipping needs. Prime encouraged customers to buy a lot more stuff, and it also forced Amazon to deliver packages more quickly. That explains why Amazon abandoned its tax-avoidance strategy earlier this decade and began building dozens of warehouses in populous areas. It also ramped up a system called ""postal injection,"" in which it uses prediction algorithms and complicated network analysis to figure out how to deliver every package to the United States postal facility nearest a customer's house. According to Deutsche, postal injection has allowed Amazon to slash the cost of the most expensive leg of shipping an item, the ""last mile"" from a warehouse to customers' homes. So despite shipping most goods faster, between 2010 and 2015 Amazon cut its shipping costs from $5.25 per box to $4.26, Deutsche estimates. But that's still not low enough. Though Amazon has released a string of stellar earnings reports recently, its shipping costs are rising, and it faces capacity constraints. During the holidays two years ago, a surge of online orders overwhelmed UPS, leading to missed deliveries. A more severe problem looms in the long run: The transportation infrastructure in the United States is aging, and the Department of Transportation has warned that unless urgent and expensive fixes are made, roads, waterways, airports and other systems will become alarmingly clogged by the 2040s. For Amazon, that projected future is catastrophic: Pretty much all of Amazon's current investments in shipping — in trucks, planes and crowdsourced delivery cars — depend on the traditional shipping infrastructure. All, that is, except for drones — which explains why they are integral to Amazon's vision of the future of retail. I was first clued in to the importance of Amazon's drone initiative, called Amazon Prime Air, when I met Gur Kimchi, the head of the program, at an industry conference a few months ago. Though our conversation was off the record, Mr. Kimchi's detailed answers to my questions suggested I had been too quick to dismiss the initiative. When I began talking to others in the drone industry about Amazon's interest in autonomous flight, they all pointed out that drones offer a way to leapfrog roads. Because they operate in a new, untrammeled layer of physical space — below 400 feet, an airspace that is currently unoccupied in most of the country — they open up a vast new shipping lane. Beyond posting several videos, Amazon has not revealed much publicly about its drone program, but it has been working with regulators worldwide to set up tests of the system. It envisions drones being able to deliver packages up to five pounds in weight, which account for 80 to 90 percent of its deliveries. Amazon also said it has built many different kinds of prototypes for different delivery circumstances. The first rollouts will likely be in low- and medium-density areas like suburbs, where a drone might land in a backyard to drop off shoes. But the company said it was also working on systems to deliver to cities — for instance, drones could deliver packages to smart lockers positioned on rooftops. As it happens, the shipping company DHL has tested just such a drone-to-locker delivery system in Germany; a representative told me that the test was a success and that it plans to expand the technology depending on regulatory approval. Amazon's patent filings hint at even more fanciful possibilities — drones could ferry packages between tiny depots housed on light poles, for example. Others project even wilder ideas. Ryan Petersen, the founder of the logistics software company Flexport, pointed out that Amazon had filed patents that envision using trucks as mobile shipping warehouses. Such self-driving trucks, prestocked with items Amazon has determined a given neighborhood might need, could roam around towns. When an order comes in, a drone might fly from the truck to a customer's house, delivering the item in minutes. Scenes like that are most likely in the far-off future. But according to Amazon, the earliest incarnation of drone deliveries will happen much sooner — we will see it within five years, somewhere in the world."
1,2016-08-10," In late July, The American Conservative ran an interview with J. D. Vance that drew so much traffic it briefly crippled the central nervous system of the magazine's website. The interviewer's last line implored readers to have a look at Mr. Vance's publishing debut, ""Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis."" Ever since, his book has hovered at high altitude on Amazon, seldom dipping below No. 10. After reading ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" you can easily understand why. This is a historically peculiar election cycle, boisterously disrupted by outsiders, one of whom found the perfect host body in the Republican Party and became its presidential nominee. An investigation of voter estrangement has never felt more urgent, and we're certainly not getting one from the lacquered chatterers on the boob tube. Now, along comes Mr. Vance, offering a compassionate, discerning sociological analysis of the white underclass that has helped drive the politics of rebellion, particularly the ascent of Donald J. Trump. Combining thoughtful inquiry with firsthand experience, Mr. Vance has inadvertently provided a civilized reference guide for an uncivilized election, and he's done so in a vocabulary intelligible to both Democrats and Republicans. Imagine that. On the checklist of modern privilege, Mr. Vance, 31, has the top four in the bag: He is white, male, straight and Protestant. But his profile is misleading. His people — hillbillies, rednecks, white trash, choose your epithet (or term of affection, depending on your point of view) — didn't step off the Mayflower and become part of America's ascendant class. ""Poverty is the family tradition,"" he writes. His ancestors and kin were sharecroppers, coal miners, machinists, millworkers — all low-paying, body-wearying occupations that over the years have vanished or offered diminished security. Mr. Vance was raised in Middletown, Ohio, a now-decaying steel town filled with Kentucky transplants, which at one point included his Mamaw and Papaw — in newscaster English, that's grandma and grandpa — who moved there shortly after World War II. Though the couple eventually managed to achieve the material comforts of a middle-class life (house, car), they brought their Appalachian values and habits with them. Some were wonderfully positive, like loyalty and love of country. But others, like a tendency toward violence and verbal abuse, were inimical to family life. Papaw was forever coming home drunk. Mamaw, ""a violent nondrunk,"" was forever tormenting him, whether by serving him artfully arranged plates of garbage for dinner or dousing him with gasoline. All this guerrilla warfare affected their children. Mr. Vance's mother was an empress of instability — violent, feckless, prone to hysteria. A long stint in rehab couldn't shake her addiction to prescription narcotics (she'd later move on to heroin). She spun through more boyfriends than this reader could count and at least five husbands. The only reason Mr. Vance made it out in one piece is because his grandparents eventually reconciled, becoming his unofficial guardians. (He also spent a terrifically affirming four years in the Marines.) Mamaw was especially encouraging. She was tough as snakeskin, foul-mouthed as a mobster and filled with love. In a town where many children don't finish high school, she raised a grandson who managed to graduate from Ohio State University and Yale Law School, defying skyscraping odds. ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" in my mind, divides into two components: the family stories Mr. Vance tells — most of which are no doubt better experienced on the page than they were in real life — and the questions he raises. Chief among them: How much should he hold his hillbilly kin responsible for their own misfortunes? In Mr. Vance's estimation, the answer is: a lot. Economic insecurity, he's convinced, accounts for only a small part of his community's problems; the much larger issue is hillbilly culture itself. Though proud of it in many ways, he's also convinced that it ""increasingly encourages social decay instead of counteracting it."" His frustration with the nonworking white poor is especially acute. He recalls being a cashier at a Middletown grocery store and watching resentfully as his neighbors, who had creatively gamed the welfare system, jabbered on their cellphones as they were going through the checkout line. He could not afford a cellphone. ""Political scientists have spent millions of words trying to explain how Appalachia and the South went from staunchly Democratic to staunchly Republican in less than a generation,"" Mr. Vance writes. He suspects those cellphones have a lot to do with it. ""I could never understand why our lives felt like a struggle while those living off of government largess enjoyed trinkets that I only dreamed about."" Time and again, Mr. Vance preaches a message of tough love and personal responsibility. He has no patience with an old acquaintance who told him he quit his job because he hated waking up early, only to take to Facebook to blame the ""Obama economy."" Or with a former co-worker at a tile warehouse who missed work once a week though his girlfriend was pregnant. Squint, and you'll note the incendiary nature of Mr. Vance's argument. It's always treacherous business to blame a group for its own misfortunes. Certainly, an outsider cannot say what Mr. Vance is saying to his kin and kind. But he can — just as President Obama can say to fellow African-Americans, ""brothers should pull up their pants,"" as he did on MTV. The difference is that President Obama believes poverty, though it may have a cultural component, is largely a structural problem, one the government can play a large role in fixing. Mr. Vance, a conservative, takes a far dimmer view. Whether you agree with Mr. Vance or not, you must admire him for his head-on confrontation with a taboo subject. And he frames his critique generously, stipulating that it isn't laziness that's destroying hillbilly culture but what the psychologist Martin Seligman calls ""learned helplessness"" — the fatalistic belief, born of too much adversity, that nothing can be done to change your lot. What he's really writing about is despair. Never is Mr. Vance more aware of this pessimism and estrangement than when he leaves for Ohio State University. He's plumped with hope; his neighbors, left behind, feel its opposite. ""There was something almost spiritual,"" he writes, ""about the cynicism of the community at large."" His friends and relations are convinced that the media lies. That politicians lie. That the military, an institution they revere, is fighting two fruitless wars. Universities feel ""rigged"" and inaccessible; job prospects are slim. For what purpose do you live under such circumstances? When the stanchions of your life have sunk into the muck? Mr. Vance doesn't have all the answers. But he's advancing the conversation."
2,2016-08-10," MANAUS, Brazil — Late Tuesday evening, as the Amazon temperature danced at 90 degrees with humidity in step, Janine van Wyk, a defender with South Africa's women's soccer team, paused just a second to take in the packed and throbbing Amazônia Arena, filled with 43,000 gloriously nuts fans. She thought to herself, ""This is amazing, to realize that all these people are supporting the women's game,"" she told me later. ""This lets younger girls everywhere know our sport is growing."" She flashed a quick smile even though her team had just been knocked out of the Olympic tournament. The wheels of change are turning in what Brazilians freely describe as their macho society. Their men's team collapsed in a heap in the World Cup two years ago and continues to play with a listlessness and diffidence in these Olympics. (Manauaras, the locals here, say the male players ""are walking on high heels,"" which means, roughly and after consultation with eminent linguists, ""arrogant snots."") The women's game — the Brazilian women in particular, but with applause left over for foreign teams as well — has captured the collective imagination here. As a colleague, Tania Franco, and I wandered around Manaus before the game, and later as we walked through the stands, the sense was that this nation's enraptured, besotted relationship with soccer had finally lapped over onto the women's side. Much of this is owed to the Brazilian women's players, who kick and run with an artful joie de vivre, offering ankle-breaking stutter steps and swashbuckling kicks. Marta, the ponytailed star long known as the Pelé of the women's game, spent too much of her career as a soccer prophet without much honor in her own country. Now she hears loud applause every time her foot touches the ball. We came upon Danyelle Christine da Silva Beleza, 14, standing and jumping and cheering in this stadium, which was built at fantastical cost and sits like a massive white orb astride northern Manaus. Her family and their neighbors' family had taken two cars and driven from Rondônia to Manaus for this game. That sounds easy enough; a map shows mileage roughly equivalent to the seven-and-a-half-hour trip from New York City to Cleveland. Except that they traversed a ""highway"" that had been closed for 30 years and that remained a dirt track through the Amazon jungle. The two families bounced and jostled for 14 hours. No matter. They wanted to see the women play. ""Brazil is a macho-man society; it is wonderful this is changing,"" Danyelle said, beaming. ""I want Marta's jersey instead of Neymar's."" Neymar is the star of that other team, the Brazilian men. As it happened, the Brazilian women could not deliver a grand victory on Tuesday night. The South African women, by their own admission playing over their heads in the drive-a-stake-through-the-eye heat, held the Brazilians to a 0-0 tie. A similar fate befell the favored American women in their game here on Tuesday as the Colombian women, riding two brilliant free kicks by Catalina Usme, a striker with a ponytail Mohawk, tied the score at 2-2. One kick went directly through Hope Solo's legs. It was that sort of night. Both games were accompanied by asterisks. The Brazilian and American teams were already assured of spots in the next round, and their coaches were not willing to watch key players melt into puddles in the Amazonian heat. So some key players sat; others played part of the game. Marta played only in the second half, and only because another player came up lame at halftime. ""I wanted to spare Marta this heat,"" the Brazilian coach, Vadão, said. ""If I got her hurt here. …"" He allowed that thought to trail off unspoken, no doubt figuring that had Marta gone down, he'd have had to take up residency under an assumed name in a distant corner of the Amazon. The American coach, Jill Ellis, offered a wry, are-you-kidding look when asked if her players had slowed toward the end of their game. ""Yeah, I would challenge anyone to run around in that heat,"" she said. There was another subtext, which plays out everywhere the Americans play in Brazil this year. Solo, at 35, is a brilliant goalkeeper; she also tends to let impolitic thought escape her subconscious when she would be wiser to bar the door. Before the Olympics, she posted on social media a photo of herself wearing a black mosquito hat and holding a big bottle of insect repellent. ""Not sharing this!!!"" she typed. ""Get your own! #zikaproof #RoadToRio."" Solo tried to backtrack. She began tweeting photos of the sunset over the Amazon. That fooled no one. She has been jeered since the Olympics began, and a boom of boos lowered on her every time she touched the ball on Tuesday. As she ran off the field at the half, she was washed over by chants of ""Zika! Zika!"" Christiane Luizedo was one of those lustful booers. ""We know that some people see Brazil as a third-world country,"" she said. ""She has disrespected our nation. Now she has to deal with the consequences."" That Solo had one of the worst games of her career was occasion for paroxysms of joy. Although, in truth, that anger did not feel deep. More striking was the newfound support for the women. Wandering through downtown Manaus, a place of pastel-colored, colonial-age buildings and perpetually busy markets that is ringed by a forest of office towers, I heard again and again a respect mixed with chagrin that fans had taken so long to embrace the women's game. Renato Andrade da Silva, a cabdriver, had the Olympics playing on a tiny screen in his cab as he hurtled through traffic. That night's game was must-see television. ""The women are such a great surprise, and the men, not so much,"" he said. ""I used to like the men more; that was my mistake."" At a cafe in a baroque old opera house, I spoke with the barista Marcelo Gadhella, 30. ""The women should be given a lot more credit,"" he said. ""And the men deserve less credit."" At a nearby table, Karen Marinho, 25, nodded. She is an aspiring archaeologist and loves the women's game. ""There's a lot of women nowadays who go to watch, and they bring their spouses,"" she said. ""The macho men say: 'Oh! Now the women play like little men.'"" She rolled her eyes. More money, she said, needs to go into promotion and player development. The women's championship games run only on obscure cable channels; the men's game is on all public channels. Vadão, the Brazilian coach, noted that his team took a cheap flight to Manaus, which is four hours by air from Rio de Janeiro. There was no food, and his players were crowded in economy. Such problems are not unique to Brazil. American female players have filed suit seeking pay equity with the less successful American men's national team. Players in women's leagues in Europe and elsewhere remain distinct second-class citizens, their games underpublicized and spottily attended. Perhaps Tuesday evening's double bill offered a window into a better future. Such was the view of Vera Pauw, the lithe Dutch woman who coaches the South African team. She came to the interview room with jaw set grim, her Olympic road at an end. Then she spoke of the artistry of the Brazilians and of the grit of her team, and especially of all those cheering fans. ""Brazil showcased a very mature women's play and pace; it was beautiful,"" she said. ""Now we know what we could do with a professional league in South Africa."" She smiled at herself. People, she said, will tell you that she is not one to gush. She could not help herself. ""To see a huge stadium filled, with fans behind every women's kick, was fantastic,"" she said. That is an Amazonian reverie right there."
3,2016-08-10," RIO DE JANEIRO — Twenty-five minutes into Tuesday night's steam bath of a soccer match in the Amazon, Hope Solo stood in front of the United States net, awaiting a free kick by Colombia's Catalina Usme from about 20 yards away. Usme launched a shot that cleared the wall of United States players and went directly at Solo, who appeared ready to catch the ball against her chest as she fell to her knees. Except that she did not. In one of the more stunning moments in recent years for the United States women's soccer team, the usually indomitable Solo let the ball slip through her legs and into the net. The blunder, one of the worst of Solo's long career, gave Colombia a 1-0 lead in a group-stage game that the Americans did not need to win or even tie to advance to the quarterfinals. Still, the mistake was disconcerting for a group seeking to defend its Olympic title from 2012 and add to the luster of its World Cup triumph last summer. As the game progressed, the United States dominated play and recaptured the lead on goals by Crystal Dunn and the 18-year-old Mallory Pugh, but Usme refused to go away. In the 76th minute, with Colombia trailing, 2-1, Usme launched another free kick, this one from further out, and it came close to going into the net, clipping the top of the crossbar just over Solo's outstretched hand. Thirteen minutes later, Usme had one more chance, on yet another free kick but from an almost impossible angle directly to Solo's left. Despite the degree of difficulty, Usme launched a curling shot that grazed off the top of Solo's right hand and, remarkably, right into the net. It was an impressive feat by Usme, and a questionable moment for Solo, who might have blocked the ball but did not. The outcome was a 2-2 draw that left the Colombian players rejoicing even though they finished last in their group and are going home. For the Americans who rested several players, the score was a blow to their egos and perhaps to Solo's confidence. Still, the tie allowed the United States to finish first in its group, and it will move on to a quarterfinal match in Brasília against Sweden. Many of the American players, including Solo, will be going up against their former coach, Pia Sundhage, who joined Sweden in 2012 after a stint with the United States. Solo did not talk to reporters immediately after Tuesday's game. She has had a challenging Olympics, booed from the first moments of the first game because of Twitter posts she had made in July. Those posts offended many in Brazil because they appeared to make light of the Zika virus, which can be spread by mosquitoes. One of the posts showed her wearing a beekeeper's mask, and the other had an array of insect repellents. Brazilians did not think either one was funny. Instead, they have booed Solo whenever she has touched the ball and chanted ""Zika!"" every time she has kicked it downfield. She received that treatment in Belo Horizonte, where the Americans shut out New Zealand and France in the past week, and she got it again Tuesday in Manaus. It is difficult to say whether the jeers have affected Solo. Last Saturday, she was outstanding as the United States won, 1-0, over France, one of the tournament's tougher teams. Against a much weaker Colombia squad, she was off her game. Solo's performance Tuesday overshadowed the return of midfielder Megan Rapinoe, who played her first minutes on the field since injuring her knee last December. Rapinoe started, played a little more than 30 minutes and made a couple of deft passes that demonstrated her ability to be the team's best playmaker. Rapinoe most likely will have a role to play as the team moves into the quarterfinals. And Solo will continue to hear more ridicule from spectators, and she will have to put Tuesday's game behind her."
0,2016-08-11," We interrupt your video stream of a man climbing the Trump Tower in Manhattan to bring you this message: Amazon is being a lot more clever with its oddball drone delivery project than you might think. In this week's State of the Art column, Farhad Manjoo takes a hard look at what Amazon may be trying to accomplish with its drones. Amazon's tiny aircraft were dismissed by many as a media stunt when they were first shown on ""60 Minutes"" in 2013. But Amazon has kept at it, and with good reason, Farhad writes. One of the online retailer's biggest problems is its distribution system, which is essentially maxed out. Much of that Amazon can't do much to fix (though it is trying). But drones could extend the delivery system beyond what it currently is. How exactly the company might do that is hard to say. A crazy idea? Perhaps. But then again, taking on retailing giants like Walmart and Barnes & Noble with a little online bookstore was also once a little crazy."
0,2016-08-13," Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week's news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Farhad: Hey, Mike! I'm really getting into experimenting with Instagram Stories, the daily video clipbook thing that Instagram recently copied from Snapchat. It's given me a totally new place online to act like a complete goofball (after Twitter and the New York Times tech section). How was your week? Mike: The most effort I exerted this week was going to the San Francisco Ferry Building to buy organic mochi from a woman whose email list I am on. The 15-year-old me would be devastated at the man I have become. Oh, and someone claiming to be Martin Shkreli sent a spam email to me and 449 other members of the media without using bcc, so I'm still getting those ""reply all"" messages. I, too, replied to all, and Gawker made fun of me for it. I deserve it. Farhad: So let's get to tech news. The big story was Walmart's $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com, a young start-up that had raised hundreds of millions of dollars to become a force in e-commerce. Jet was bleeding money, and some in the tech industry were predicting imminent doom — an unsurprising fate for a company entering a market that has been so thoroughly dominated by Amazon. So the Walmart acquisition was a surprise — at least it was to me — and it surely works out well for the investors who poured so much into the company. Mike: You and I went back and forth on this one, mainly because I think it was a win and a loss, in that Jet won't be what it wanted to be: a stand-alone company that could kill Amazon. But $3.3 billion also isn't bad for two years of work. Farhad: Beyond the payoff for investors, I'm pretty skeptical of this deal. I don't see how it solves some of Walmart's fundamental problems — getting people to start thinking of the company as a primary online shopping destination. Earlier this year, I argued that Amazon had become unstoppable in e-commerce, and its recent earnings reports seem to bear this out. Walmart has been trying for years to revitalize its digital operations; the Jet purchase is another reset. But isn't it too late? Mike: I don't think it's too late to sell stuff online at good prices. Walmart's digital arm does generate revenue — though that is trending downhill in its growth trajectory, which is part of why it bought Jet — so it's not like no one shops at Walmart online. That said, I think Amazon is so far ahead of everyone else that it is truly difficult for me to see a future where Amazon isn't dominant in e-commerce in the United States. However! China is a whole other story. Alibaba reigns supreme there, so it's not like they've conquered the world. Farhad: So they've conquered the non-China world — that's pretty big! There were a few other stories worth mentioning this week. Exec shuffling: Google's venture capital arm — I'm sorry, I mean Alphabet's venture capital arm — is getting a new boss. David Krane (whom I knew as one of Google's first public relations people; I'm that old) is going to replace Bill Maris, who was the founding partner of Google Ventures (now called GV, because Google apparently loves changing names of stuff). Mike: GV is like the Madonna of venture firms. Make your name funky to stand out among the rest. It kind of works! Farhad: Meanwhile, Arianna Huffington, co-founder of the eponymous Huffington Post, announced she'd be stepping down as editor of the site to work at her wellness start-up. As I said on Twitter, other than Mark Zuckerberg, it's hard to think of anyone in the last decade who has been as influential (for better or worse) as Arianna in changing how American media works. Mike: Everyone forgets that before legacy media was upset with BuzzFeed's model, HuffPo angered everyone with its aggregation pioneering approach. One of my favorite moments on video from our beloved, late colleague, David Carr, was when he held up a picture of what aggregation machine sites would look like were it not for the original journalism that outlets like The Times produces. It was the sickest journalism burn ever. Farhad: Speaking of media, Facebook made a move to block ad-blocking this week — but it was quickly countered by the ad blockers. This seems like one of those wars that's going to go on for a while. Mike: Yeah, I'm pretty sure Facebook took two minutes to find a fix to that. Farhad: Finally, Snapchat put out a racist picture filter — again. This week the photo-messaging app unveiled a feature that lets you turn your face into that of an anime character. At least, that was what it said it intended. What it ended up with was ""yellowface"" — a filter that turns your face into a crude racial caricature of Asian people. This is bad enough on its own, but it's made worse by the fact that it isn't the first time this happened. Snapchat released a blackface filter in April. The company has taken the filter down, but what's the deal? Should we read something more into the fact that the company has recently put out two obviously overtly racist products? Mike: So it's pretty mind-boggling that both of these things got through the organization and into the app. It brings up a few questions. What do the ranks of the organization look like in order to make something like this O.K. in the eyes of at least a number of people in the company? Questions of diversity obviously spring to mind — which Snapchat has never really addressed or divulged numbers on publicly — and I imagine a more diverse staff might have at least caused some people to question their choices in putting these filters out. If there were indeed people inside of Snapchat that found these filters objectionable — and I certainly hope there were — what does the organization structure look like and how does it function in a way that allows these decisions to go unchecked and ultimately carried out? Are those people who would object able to make their voices heard internally? And if not, why not? I doubt we'll get a ton of transparency from Snapchat on the issue, since they're quite a secretive company anyway. Farhad: katie zhu, a Chinese-American engineer and product manager who works at Medium (and who prefers that her name be rendered in lowercase), published a really insightful post on this incident. She urged people to delete Snapchat. ""They've repeatedly demonstrated their blasé attitude towards issues of diversity, inclusion and representation,"" she wrote. She pointed out that Evan Spiegel, Snapchat's chief executive, was unwilling to disclose how diverse his company is during an interview at the Code Conference last year. Spiegel also seemed uncomfortable with the notion that the tech industry has had a particular problem hiring a diverse work force (which seems obvious according to the numbers). ""I think I'm saying that diversity is a challenge everywhere, including tech — and that's kind of that,"" Spiegel told the interviewer, Walt Mossberg. When Mossberg pressed him, Spiegel still seemed hesitant. ""There are so many things that feed into diversity and inequality that unpacking them on the stage is probably not the best use of time,"" he said. Mike:  I was at that conference. It was super awkward. Farhad: Snapchat says it recently hired a recruiter to focus on hiring underrepresented minorities, so perhaps Spiegel's view has changed. To me, these two incidents do underscore the importance of a diverse work force: Tech companies are usually small groups of homogeneous people who are trying to make products that satisfy the entire planet. At the very least, a diverse work force can help guard against them making choices that offend large swaths of their potential userbase. Even more than that, a diverse work force can help them come up with new ideas that may not have occurred to 20-something Stanford bros. Mike: That's why I applaud companies that make it a goal of theirs to strive for diversity at the outset, something that, unless you've really made it a point to think about these issues, an entrepreneur may not have even thought of. Perhaps it is also on the venture capitalists and mentors to remind young entrepreneurs that aiming for diversity is, in fact, a strength, and something to be considered when growing the company. One would hope this doesn't happen again, but this is tech: anything goes, however terrible. On that note, have a good weekend, friend!"
0,2016-08-16," During his second term as president of Peru, from 2006 to 2011, Alan García made deals and pushed through laws allowing for greater corporate and industrial incursions into the Amazon than the government had ever permitted. Various factions rose up to oppose his administration's actions, including Aidesep, the interethnic association for the development of the Peruvian rain forest, an organization of indigenous Amazonians led by Alberto Pizango. ""When Two Worlds Collide,"" a documentary directed by the first-time feature filmmakers Heidi Brandenburg and Matthew Orzel, chronicles a conflict that resulted in one particularly effective piece of civil disobedience — a move by indigenous protesters to cut off commercial trucking routes — before it deteriorated into violence and death. The movie uses television news footage, and meetings and protests shot by the filmmakers, who have been recording their subjects since 2007, and recent interviews with former government figures and protesters. They also profile Mr. Pizango, who at one point seeks asylum in Nicaragua after being charged with sedition for leading protests, but returns to Peru to face those allegations a year later. The issues presented in ""When Two Worlds Collide"" are so crucial that it feels churlish to characterize it as a dutiful, and ultimately pedestrian, documentary. There is something evasive about it as well. Late in the movie, we see Mr. Pizango speaking with the father of a police officer who disappeared amid the violence tied to the protests, and his manner is chilly to the point of calculating — he's no longer the soulful man of the people that Ms. Brandenburg and Mr. Orzel have been portraying. If this is a genuine side to Mr. Pizango and not just a momentary aberration, it would have been worth looking into.  ""When Two Worlds Collide"" is not rated. It is in Spanish, with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 43 minutes."
1,2016-08-16," MANAUS, Brazil — Our tale takes metaphorical root in the early 1880s and the fevered imaginings of rubber barons. Sitting by the vast Amazon River, bewitched by pink river dolphins and torrential downpours, surrounded by rain forest, these men hungered for a legacy worthy of kings. So they imported an Italian architect, the mellifluously named Celestial Sacardim, to build an opera house. He conceived a heaven: columns of Carrara marble; chandeliers of Murano glass; 36,000 hand-painted roof tiles from Alsace; parquet floors of walnut, oak and Norwegian maple; tapestries from the looms of Flanders. Liverpool foundries provided the steel. The Teatro Amazonas was beautiful and insanely expensive and as ephemeral as everything else in this sweltering land. The rubber barons, legend has it, persuaded Enrico Caruso to journey here and sing Verdi. Then the rubber economy collapsed, and the opera house, which still stands in the colonial quarter, fell into decade upon decade of damp disuse. All of which brings us to a new hallucination: the Arena da Amazônia in Manaus, a city whose name comes from a local tribe and means Mother of the Gods. When Brazil embarked on an orgy of arena construction for the World Cup in 2014, Manaus city leaders decided to build the grandest arena of all. Years in the making, at a cost of $220 million, it was crafted to resemble a giant white basket of a type common in the region, atop a four-story concrete plaza. The arena seats 44,351 people. Save for the rarest of occasions, such as when Olympic women's soccer teams played here recently, this arena sits empty. Manaus is surrounded by a rain forest the size of France, Spain, Sweden, Greece and Italy combined, and it is reachable only by airplane or boat. Most in this hard-working city of two million have more on their mind than sports. The debt for this ziggurat has piled high and requires siphoning off of money intended for schools and hospitals. One-quarter of Manauarans are extremely poor; many lack running water. I wandered into the high-ceiling marble cafe of that opera house, which has been reincarnated as a tourist attraction and for music and dance events. Erica Damasceno, 20, sipped coffee as I asked about the stadium. She wagged her hand. ""I never go there,"" she said. Never? She shook her head. ""Never. So much money was put into it, and we have such great needs: schools, hospitals. Every big public project is an excuse to steal money."" I stepped outside into an equatorial sun that felt like a fat hand pressed down on my skull. I found Maciel De Souza sitting in the shade of a tree with his co-worker Natalia Vilacio, tourist guides without tourists. Do you go to the stadium? ""Yes,"" De Souza replied. How often? ""Once."" He shook his head. ""It's a white elephant, a big one,"" he said in Portuguese through an interpreter. ""Sometimes tourists like to see it. No one is ever inside."" Arena dreams tend toward the ridiculous, from Milwaukee to Minneapolis to Manaus. Promises of economic benefits are as illusory as lost civilizations. FIFA, the world soccer federation, required that World Cup host nations build at least eight stadiums. Brazil, in a fit of prideful excess, insisted on building 10, at a cost of nearly $2 billion. Those stadiums have become aspiring archaeological digs. Brasília spent $550 million to build its stadium; it doubles as a municipal bus depot. The stadium in Cuiabá cost $230 million, and homeless men sleep in the locker rooms. Managers at Recife's grand Arena Pernambuco are at such wits' end that they rented it out for a 15-year-old boy's birthday. The magazine Americas Quarterly found that Brazil's expenses for the World Cup greatly outran its revenue. Brazil repeated its wasteful act for the Olympics. There are corruption inquiries in a half-dozen states, with construction companies and hapless officials under the magnifying glass. That brings us back to Manaus and its Fitzcarraldo-esque excess. (Fitzcarraldo was the dreamer in a Werner Herzog movie who had the unhinged ambition to haul a steamship over a mountain in the Peruvian Amazon.) As was true for the opera house, no expense was spared in the construction of the Arena da Amazônia. Steel was poured in Europe and loaded at the port of Aveiro in Portugal. Workers filled three giant freighters to the gills with steel, and a fourth ferried the membrane that serves as the roof. It took this fleet 20 days to trundle across the Atlantic and many more to edge up the Amazon. Construction was a dank nightmare. Three workers died. Foundations were poured, and repoured. Steel joints buckled in the humidity. Project managers discovered that ""an unwelcome tributary of the French River"" ran under the site. From December to March, Manaus receives about 45 inches of rain, so there was the Noah problem, too. No roads run to Manaus other than dangerous dirt tracks impassable in wet weather. As the project manager said at the time, ""This was a huge, huge, huge challenge."" Those challenges later turned to red ink. The local soccer teams here are the equivalent of the Rookie League Kingsport Mets and draw 1,000 fans on the best nights. They could not afford the rent. A few big league teams, those from São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, sometimes played here, but only if the state containing Manaus provided a subsidy of one sort or another. It is a four-hour flight from Rio to this capital of the Amazon. At the time of the construction, Manaus's mayor, Arthur Virgilio Neto, offered enthusiasm that would sound familiar to those rubber lords of centuries past. ""It will be very good for international shows,"" Neto told NPR. ""I've heard that many pop stars have dreamed of singing for a low price in the Amazon jungle."" I imagine that Bono and Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar might dream of singing beneath a canopy of giant kapok trees. So far, none have journeyed here to do so. Fabricio Lima, Manaus's secretary of state for youth, sports and leisure, sat for an interview last week with my colleague Tania Franco. He faces daunting numbers. From January to April, the Arena da Amazônia generated $180,000 in revenue. Its expenses in that period totaled $560,000. That was its least-terrible performance in a while. So far, Lima's best customers are the Amazon's many evangelical ministers. Each night he dreams grandly; each morning he acts modestly. What is his latest idea for the arena? He smiled and replied, ""Weddings and birthday parties."" Later that day, I walked through the old wrought-iron market down by the banks of the Amazon. A hot wind eddied and swirled, and I listened as Marcio Morais, an herb merchant, explained how his grandfather, who was raised in the jungle, taught him to harvest herbs. Liver inflammation, kidney problems, asthma, erectile dysfunction: He has an herb for nearly every ailment. Our talk turned to the arena. He frowned. ""Olympic Games are nice, but why are we spending money on this?"" he said. ""It could have been a university. It could have been a school. Do you know we have an opera house? Such big dreams."" I allowed that I knew of those dreams. ""Sometimes you have to wake up,"" he replied. With that, we shook hands, and I stepped out into the dream-inducing heat."
0,2016-08-18," At the recent premiere in London of the play ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,"" J. K. Rowling insisted that she is really, truly, done with writing about Harry Potter. ""Harry is done now,"" Ms. Rowling told Reuters. She did not, however, rule out writing more about the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. On Wednesday Ms. Rowling's publishing platform, Pottermore, announced a coming e-book series set in the wizarding world. These digital anthologies will collect Ms. Rowling's short stories and other writings from her website, and will include some new stories about Hogwarts characters. The first three books in the series, out Sept. 6, will center on the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and are roughly 10,000 words. The collections will feature some new writing — including a story about Harry's teacher Horace Slughorn, and one about Professor Minerva McGonagall's part in the second wizarding war — but will otherwise consist of previously published material from Pottermore. The e-book news was met with jubilation but also confusion on social media, as some fans celebrated what they mistakenly thought were new Harry Potter books, and Pottermore tried to quash the rumors. The e-books will be sold on Pottermore, as well as on Amazon and other digital retailers, and will cost $2.99 each. There are no current plans to release the books in print, and Pottermore editors have not determined how long the e-book series will be, according to Anna Rafferty, Pottermore's director of product, creative and content. ""'Pottermore Presents' is intended to supplement the Harry Potter book series with short-form content that is entertaining and thematically curated by the Pottermore editorial team,"" Susan L. Jurevics, the chief executive of Pottermore, said in a statement. ""J. K. Rowling's writing in these collections reveals intricate details of her characters' lives, their histories, as well as her inspiration."" Though Ms. Rowling has focused her creative energies on writing adult novels, including her Robert Galbraith detective series, she has been reluctant to fully retire Harry and his cohorts. And why would she? ""Harry Potter"" is arguably the most lucrative publishing franchise in history, with global sales topping 450 million copies, a blockbuster film franchise, a theme park and now a London stage production that is sold out well into next year. The script book of ""Cursed Child,"" which was written not by Ms. Rowling, but by the playwright Jack Thorne, has sold more than 3.3 million copies in North America in less than a month. But Ms. Rowling's latest big announcement may test the limits of fans's devotion. Will her readers pay for something that they used to get free on her website? Pottermore, which was created in 2011, has been an essential part of Ms. Rowling's marketing strategy ever since she officially ""ended"" the Harry Potter series in 2007. On Pottermore, Ms. Rowling has teased fans with details about coming projects, posted quizzes, published new short fiction and provided new background about familiar characters. By collecting and selling material from Pottermore, Ms. Rowling is monetizing a part of the franchise that until now has been a free playground for Potter fans. Ms. Rowling controls the e-book and audiobook rights for the Harry Potter franchise, and adding new digital material in e-book form could drive digital backlist sales. On Thursday, pre-orders had already driven the first three ""Pottermore Presents"" e-books to the fourth, fifth and sixth spots on Amazon's Kindle best-seller list, behind ""Cursed Child."" But it could also alienate some fans who have already griped about franchise exploitation after Ms. Rowling and her publishers, Scholastic and Bloomsbury, packaged the new play as the eighth book in the Harry Potter series, even though Ms. Rowling didn't write it herself. ""It is so far from the Harry Potter world we know and love,"" one disappointed reader wrote in a one star review of ""Cursed Child on Amazon. Shame on J. K. Rowling for being part of this rubbish."""
1,2016-08-18," Amazon is posting three new comedy pilots on Friday. You know what they say in baseball — if you get a hit one out of every three at-bats, you're in the Hall of Fame. The hit here, or at least the show that's going to garner a lot of attention, is ""I Love Dick,"" an adaptation of the much-admired 1997 novel of the same title by Chris Kraus. That the show is from Jill Soloway, creator of Amazon's most acclaimed series, ""Transparent,"" tells us that this is no trial balloon; unlike some earlier offerings in the Amazon pilot program (anyone remember ""Browsers""?), this one will surely stick. Ms. Soloway has set herself quite a task in making a TV series out of the book, which has a cult following and an honored place in the history of feminist literature. (Note to its fans: If you can't get past the notion that the series takes a lot of license with the source material, don't even bother.) It's about a frustrated filmmaker named Chris who fixates on a charismatic cultural theorist, Dick, though she is married. The TV series, which at least at the start is set in Marfa, the arts-and-academic community in Texas, certainly has casting going for it. Kevin Bacon is Dick, and Griffin Dunne is Chris's husband, Sylvère. The series, though, rises or falls on the shoulders of the Chris character, and Kathryn Hahn, one of the most reliable actresses around, looks in the pilot as if she could end up with some statuettes for her portrayal. The pilot doesn't progress far into the story — Chris has barely had time to meet Dick and share one dismissive dinner with him and her husband — but it's clear that Ms. Hahn's character is eager to go exploring and that Ms. Soloway intends to make a challenging, simmering, provocative sort of comedy. Another cult following also gets a pilot to chew on: ""The Tick,"" the latest try at making a TV series out of the comic book character that Ben Edlund created in the 1980s. The title character (played here by Peter Serafinowicz) is a parody of a superhero, wearing a blue tick costume and speaking in overblown phrases that sometimes sort of make sense. Patrick Warburton captured the Tick perfectly in a 2001 live-action adaptation on Fox, but the show didn't last. (An animated version from the 1990s also has its devotees.) Whether Mr. Serafinowicz's Tick will capture fans is difficult to tell because, weirdly, most of the pilot is used to lay out the back story of Arthur (Griffin Newman), a wimpy young man who becomes the Tick's sidekick. It's not a welcoming introduction to those not well versed in Tick-ology. And then there's ""Jean-Claude Van Johnson,"" in which Jean-Claude Van Damme tries to parody his own action-movie persona. He plays himself, but it turns out he has an undercover identity as Jean-Claude Van Johnson, a vaguely defined contractor who does black-ops work. But — pay attention because this gets confusing — to go undercover as Van Johnson, Van Johnson has to assume the identity of Jean-Claude Van Damme, because a movie shoot is what gets him into Bulgaria, where Van Johnson needs to be. If that seems like a convoluted way to get to a simple gag, it is, and though the pilot does pay off in a pretty funny fight sequence, it's not at all clear by its end where this series intends to go with what seems like a one-joke premise."

You can browse previous guides here, and to receive recommendations straight to your inbox, sign up here. Stay tuned for our coming website. I took a short vacation and now I feel utterly unable to function in normal society. Breakfast should begin slowly and quietly around noon, all sandwiches should be lobster rolls and every day should include some kind of beach excursion. But real life beckons, as it always does. The good news is that real life includes some exciting new TV shows this weekend — time to turn our brains toward the television future and embrace what comes next. That's never really been my strong suit, though, so I'll also probably rewatch a few episodes of ""Mad Men,"" since I found myself thinking about that show an awful lot in the last few weeks. I can't help it — I still miss it. Have a joyous weekend, friends. ""The Hindenburg Explodes!,"" Adult Swim (free, but it's only up until Monday; select it from the ""Now Showing"" drop-down menu). Watch if you wish ""Children's Hospital"" was set on a doomed airship. Adult Swim has posted four pilots for new, short shows – three cartoons and one live-action piece. The live-action ""Hindenburg,"" co-created by and co-starring Rob Corddry, is the best of the bunch. John Cho, Lauren Lapkus, Leslie Bibb, Nate Corddry, Kevin McDonald and Danny Pudi among others play passengers, time travelers, ""adventurers"" and historical figures on this silly, occasionally crass, spoof. It's not clear how exactly the show would be expanded past these 10 minutes, but let's try to believe that we live in a world full of good surprises. ""The Jim Gaffigan Show,"" Sunday, 10 p.m., TV Land. Watch if you like loosely autobiographical showbiz stories. ""The Jim Gaffigan Show"" has improved tremendously since its premiere last year, finding a little more edge and identity — though perhaps we have hit full cultural saturation on ""comic plays comic in show about him or herself."" This week brings the series' two-episode season finale, and the show works just fine episodically. Don't feel a need to ""catch up,"" but if you want to orient yourself a little, watch the surprisingly profound Season 2 episode, ""The Calling,"" in which Jim searches for meaning in his life. ""I Love Dick,"" ""The Tick"" and ""Jean-Claude Van Johnson,"" Amazon.  Watch if you want to participate in the voting process or already like the creators and stars of these shows. Welcome to another round of Amazon pilots. The streaming platform's ""system,"" in which viewer votes allegedly affect which shows go to series, ultimately seems as capricious and bummer-filled as the old network model: This spring, the platform introduced one compelling and one snoozy drama, ""The Interestings"" and ""The Last Tycoon."" And yet ""Tycoon"" is the one that's moving forward. Alas! The world is cruel. But ""I Love Dick"" is pretty great. It's based on Chris Kraus's book of the same name, and (broadly) adapted by Jill Soloway, the creator of ""Transparent."" Soloway teams with her frequent muse Kathryn Hahn, who plays a stymied filmmaker spending a season in Marfa, Tex., with her academic husband (Griffin Dunne), when she meets the alluring, confounding Dick (Kevin Bacon, almost comically eroticized). Soloway's loose, empathetic style and passion for slightly irritating characters are in full force. But ""Dick"" is less languid than ""Transparent,"" and has a steadier beat than her film ""Afternoon Delight."" Here's hoping it goes to series. ""The Tick"" is the newest reboot in the cult ""Tick"" franchise — first a comic book, then an animated series, then a live-action series and now another live-action series. This version stars Peter Serafinowicz as the titular superhero, and Griffin Newman (""Vinyl"") as Arthur, a dweeby accountant who becomes the Tick's sidekick. Originalists will probably grumble about this darker spin's lack of camp and flair, but there's plenty to like here, even with so many superhero-story options. Finally, ""Jean-Claude Van Johnson,"" starring Jean-Claude Van Damme as an action-movie star who moonlights as a secret operative, did absolutely nothing for me, but if you are a JCVD die-hard, your mileage will almost certainly vary. Enjoy an action-packed summer blockbuster from the near comfort of your A.C. unit with ""Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation."" In this latest ""Mission: Impossible"" edition, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) goes under the radar to try to thwart yet another covert organization bent on destroying his colleagues at the Impossible Mission Force (IMF). Boasting incredible stunts, car chases, explosions and a talented cast that includes Alec Baldwin, Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson, the fifth movie in the franchise pushes the boundaries of death-defying feats at every turn. You don't need to have seen previous installments of this spy caper series' to enjoy ""Rogue Nation."" But remember to breathe during the movie's excruciating underwater scene and daredevil plane sequence. (Watch on Amazon Prime) — Monica Castillo 'The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore' Comedy Central announced this week that Thursday would be the final night for ""The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore."" Based on the ratings, this isn't a huge surprise — the show never found a big audience. It also never quite found its ideal form: While Wilmore's openers were sharp, they often covered the same clips as ""The Daily Show"" had a half-hour earlier, and crosstalk-heavy panel conversations are the worst possible format for telling jokes or conveying information. Here's hoping there's another, better show in Wilmore's future. He spoke with The New York Times earlier this week about the abrupt end to the show and the work he's most proud of. I've raved about this doc in the newsletter a lot, but, all five parts of ESPN's fascinating, fantastic documentary ""O.J. Simpson: Made in America"" are now streaming on Hulu."
0,2016-08-22," In the tech business, you often invent the product first and find out what it's for later. Facebook was a college social site before it became a global media hub; Amazon was a bookseller before it was, well, everything. Likewise with AMC's ""Halt and Catch Fire,"" set in the 1980s at the advent of the personal-computing revolution. When the series began two years ago, it was another start-up chasing a trend — in this case, the cable-TV antihero. Joe MacMillan (Lee Pace), a mysterious, smooth-talking drifter of a businessman, was paired with Gordon Clark (Scoot McNairy), a brilliant but failed engineer, in a sketchy scheme to bring an IBM clone to market. As a plot, it was less than inspiring, and as a character story, less than inspired: an 8-bit Don Draper and a Walter White who dealt in megabytes rather than meth. But at the end of its first season, ""Halt"" did something almost unheard-of in television, if not in tech: It upended its entire project. With the introduction of the Apple Macintosh, Joe and Gordon discovered that they had been chasing yesterday's dream. They were thinking too small, too incrementally. The quest of the entire season had been a failure of imagination. And ""Halt"" would have been as well, had it not rebooted  itself. The outstanding second season latched on to a much more powerful idea. The 1980s, it said, were not the decade of a mechanical revolution but a cultural one. The headlines then were about computing power coming to your desktop. But the long-term change, barely glimmering in the days of telephone modems, lay in the connection of every desktop to every other. It was the birth of the social internet, where we now live. Season 2 followed Mutiny, a nascent online gaming company started by Gordon's wife, Donna (Kerry Bishé), and Cameron Howe (Mackenzie Davis), an impassioned sparkplug of a programmer. For all practical purposes, the series changed not just its focus but its lead characters. Cameron was visionary but impractical; Donna relished the new start but chafed at being forced into the role of the buzz kill adult in the room. (Ms. Bishé gave a nuanced, undersung performance.) This was something we hadn't seen so often before: a tricky but fruitful alliance between two women in a male-dominated industry. Cameron had the digital native's instinct to see the online world as a place of constant invention. Donna had the emotional intelligence to notice that Mutiny's social component — its chat rooms — was the future of the future. Season 3, which begins on Tuesday, continues the show's iterative-learning process, picking up in 1986, as Mutiny has relocated from Texas to Silicon Valley and is beginning to reconceive itself one more time. (Cameron and Donna have noticed their gamers' taking over Mutiny chat to negotiate real-world trades — shades of Craigslist or eBay.) The growing pains continue, throwing the women into the unfamiliar and testosterone-heavy world of venture capitalists. ""It only takes one of them to ask you to the dance,"" says their consigliere, John Bosworth (Toby Huss). Cameron replies, ""I love how even the metaphors in this business are sexist."" They find a possible ally in Diane (Annabeth Gish), a sympathetic but bluntly honest investor. Gordon has come along in tow, feeling at loose ends in a managerial role at Mutiny. The chameleonic Joe, meanwhile, has landed in California as the head of a software-security firm, sporting a Steve Jobsian beard and speaking in pretentious koans. (""I've been accused of selling fear,"" he tells a rapt audience. ""But let me ask you: Is it fear or is it truth?"") Joe's re-reinvention as a smug tech guru suits Mr. Pace, a striking but peculiar presence whom the show has struggled to use effectively. (He was well cast in the ""Hobbit"" movies as the frosty, Eurotrash-y elven king Thranduil.) He seems fully at home now, strutting around his office listening to Gary Numan music, carrying himself like a human Patrick Nagel print. Joe 3.0 is also a prelude to the fatuous moguls of HBO's ""Silicon Valley,"" to which ""Halt"" is a temporal and tonal bookend. Where ""Silicon Valley"" is a gleeful satire about business people feigning idealism — all that hoo-hah about changing the world — ""Halt"" is an empathetic drama about idealists trying to fake their way into business. The new season begins to give you some sense of how we got from there to here. We see the same scrambles to get first-mover advantage, the pilgrimages up and down Sand Hill Road seeking venture capital. But where ""Silicon Valley"" trades in decacorns (start-ups valued at over $10 billion), it's jarring in ""Halt"" to see deals done for six figures — not even Dr. Evil money. The new season takes time to reset, and the movement in the early episodes is slow. The character dynamics are solid, though, and the '80s details continue to be spot on. (At a fancy Valley restaurant, Donna stumbles over the pronunciation of a trendy new dish: risotto.) But any well-produced period piece can recreate bygone days. ""Halt"" lets you see them as the cusp of bracing change. The real product in its tech business isn't hardware or software — it's tomorrow, and ""Halt and Catch Fire"" makes its past future feel dewy and new."

In ""Eat the World With Emeril Lagasse,"" a six-episode Amazon series that begins Friday, Sept. 2, Mr. Lagasse (of Food Network fame) nibbles his way around the globe with guidance from some well-traveled colleagues. In China, Mario Batali joins him on a quest for the best dumpling soup. In Sweden, the teacher is Marcus Samuelsson, and the lesson is New Nordic cuisine. Danny Bowien provides an introduction to Jeong Kwan, a Zen Buddhist nun in South Korea known as the Philosopher Chef. And José Andrés takes Mr. Lagasse to Barcelona, where the modernist genius Ferran Adrià and his army of thinkers dissect food down to the molecule. It might be Amazon's answer to Netflix's ""Chef's Table,"" with enough food porn and zesty banter to keep viewers aroused. But fears of a loud American prowling the globe should be laid to rest: Not a single ""bam!"" resounded in the two episodes I watched."
1,2016-08-24," WHAT do subscriptions to a newspaper, magazine or Netflix account have in common? Once you sign up, you expect to pay the same rate every month. Yet that's not the case at Amazon when you subscribe to its Subscribe & Save program, which automatically refills orders for household staples like instant coffee, napkins or trash bags. Amazon's subscription program, which was introduced in 2007, lets consumers register to have their favorite consumables delivered regularly — monthly, for example — in exchange for a discount of at least 5 percent off each order. Buried in the e-commerce company's terms and conditions is that the Subscribe & Save discount is applied to the price of the item at the time that the order is placed. And on Amazon, prices change frequently — including sometimes rising. I learned this the hard way while reviewing an email summary of my Amazon subscriptions. A pack of lint rollers that I had subscribed to for more than two years recently jumped to $18.04 a pack, up from $12.44 since the last delivery a few months ago, or almost a 50 percent increase. A quick web search revealed other consumers were also surprised by price jumps for Subscribe & Save items. One Amazon customer said he signed up for a $10 box of chewing gum and was charged $100 for the same product a month later. In Amazon's online forums, dozens of people posted about prices of Subscribe & Save items fluctuating, with some calling the program a ""bait and switch"" subscription scheme. Amazon declined to comment. The company emails people 10 days before a recurring subscription delivery, when it informs customers of a new price of their item so they can change or skip the order. Any sticker shock, analysts said, may be the result of Amazon's complex pricing system coming into conflict with consumer expectations of a traditional subscription. Jared Wiesel, a partner at Revenue Analytics, a pricing and sales consulting firm, said of Amazon, ""I think they've violated the psychological concept of a subscription with their customers in changing prices like this. When people think of a subscription, they think of locking in a set cadence of receiving a good."" Amazon, the top online retailer in the United States, has not said how many customers use Subscribe & Save. Yet its program is prominent among a growing number of internet retailers that are finding success in subscription-based sales models, such as Dollar Shave Club, the subscription razor company that recently sold for $1 billion to Unilever, or the Honest Company, which lets parents subscribe to baby products like diapers and wipes. Amazon's dynamic pricing system, in which it frequently adjusts item prices based on a sophisticated set of variables like supply and demand, time of day and prices offered by competitors, is the company's way of making it look as if you are always getting the best deal, Mr. Wiesel said. Prices of goods can also fall, of course. But even when prices decline, people need to beware because Amazon's pricing tends to fluctuate more widely and more frequently than at your local grocery store or Walmart, Mr. Wiesel added. In traditional retail, the major price changes typically happen during promotions, he said. To get a preliminary view into whether people can save — or not — with Amazon's program, I plugged prices of 50 featured Subscribe & Save items into a spreadsheet and looked at their price histories over the previous six months. I compiled the results with the web tool Camel Camel Camel, an Amazon price tracker. Prices of most items, including dishwasher soap and toilet bowl cleaner, changed frequently. As often as weekly, prices rose, dipped and rose again like a roller coaster. In extreme cases, prices for items like instant coffee and napkins jumped between 90 and 170 percent. (Prices below reflect subscription discounts.) • Folgers Coffee, 30.5-Ounce Tub In June: $6.64 In August: $12.50 This week: $7.59 • Vanity Fair Napkins In May: $7.94 In June and July: $21.46 This week: $15.36 ______ Only five of the Subscribe & Save items held steady. • Sparkle Paper Towels Over six months: $25.99 • Death Wish Coffee Over six months: $19.99 After the service's 5 percent discount, the paper towels cost $24.69 and the coffee cost $18.99. Not bad. ______ In the end, whether you save money depends on when your subscription order is placed and what items you buy. The downside of buying through Amazon's subscription program is the lack of predictability, Mr. Wiesel said. ""I've never seen this type of price fluctuation in a brick-and-mortar store,"" he added. Some highlights over the last six months (with subscription discounts applied): • GermGuardian Air Purifier Replacement Filter Low: $18.06 High: $33.24 • Honeywell Humidifier Replacement Filter Low: $4.67 High: $11.27 • Lysol Disinfecting Wipes (3-Pack) Low: $8.95 High: $17.91 ______ Mr. Wiesel noted that it would be tough for Amazon to revise its subscription program to offer items at fixed rates. A majority of sales on Amazon are one-time purchases, and dynamic pricing is fundamental to how the company operates. If, for example, Subscribe & Save prices remained static, those customers could miss out when prices go down for one-time purchases of the same products. If you truly want to save money on Amazon, one approach is to sign up for price alerts on Camel Camel Camel to get an email when a price drops to a desired amount. When that happens, manually reorder — yes, that's an extra step — your instant coffee, toilet cleaner or lint rollers. Sucharita Mulpuru-Kodali, an analyst for Forrester Research who follows Amazon, said the retailer was probably pushing prices up to test how loyal customers are to products and how much more they are willing to pay for them. Yet the sharp price changes on Subscribe & Save items caught her by surprise. ""It doesn't seem as customer-friendly as Amazon typically is,"" she said. ""That's what's unusual."""
0,2016-08-25," Dear Diary: In mid-July, Amazon incorrectly delivered a medium-size box to my building's lobby. For two days, the box was ignored, with my neighbors walking around it. Because I'm a nice person, I picked up the box and brought it to my apartment. I called Amazon's customer-service number, explained that the box had been incorrectly left at our building and asked to have it picked up and delivered to the person who placed the order. I was put on hold. Eventually the customer-service rep returned and asked me to take the box to the post office and mark it ""return to sender."" I responded, ""No,"" saying that I was concerned that the person who placed the order receive their merchandise. ""Please, Amazon, arrange for pick up and correct delivery."" Again, I was put on hold. After several minutes I was told that Amazon would notify the person who placed the order that it had been incorrectly delivered. Either the person would get a refund or the merchandise would be re-sent. The customer service rep informed me that I could dispose of the box and its contents or keep whatever was in the box. For nearly an hour the box sat on my living room floor unopened. Curiosity got the best of me and with the help of two visiting teenage girls, the box was opened. My reward for being a nice person: 48 rolls of toilet paper."
0,2016-08-26," Apollo Global Management and Searchlight Capital are making a $4.3 billion bet on capitulation. Apollo, the private-equity company run by Leon Black, is leading a deal to take Rackspace, a cloud computing company, private after it struggled to compete with Amazon, Microsoft and other technology giants. If Rackspace's strategic shift to sell services on these platforms succeeds, Apollo will have a nice payday. About 70 percent of Rackspace's revenue comes from managing server farms for individual companies. That is a stable but relatively low-growth business. The excitement has come from its public cloud operations, where it competes against Amazon Web Services and Microsoft's Azure, selling on-demand computing and services. The problem is this is a business of scale. Bigger companies can negotiate to buy servers and power for less, and deploy gear more effectively. So Amazon and Microsoft can offer better deals to customers without suffering a big hit to margins. Rackspace is trying a bit of jujitsu. While it is not abandoning its efforts, the company realizes it cannot effectively compete with Amazon and Microsoft. So it has become a partner, selling services and helping companies connect their data and software to Amazon Web Services and Azure. There is an additional benefit to Apollo. It takes a lot less capital to offer consulting services than to build and run server farms. There is risk. While its existing business of managing server farms for individual businesses probably will provide enough cash flow to cover costs and service debt, success will rely on its new partnerships taking off. That may not happen. Customers may wonder whether it makes sense to pay for additional support and services, especially as Amazon and Microsoft continually make their web services easier to use. The growth of cloud computing, however, may mean there's plenty of room on the Amazon and Microsoft bandwagons."

The Witch (Sept. 17): In 17th-century Massachusetts, a family exiled from a local community tries to make a go of it on the edge of a forest. But misery befalls them. Is a witch to blame? (Probably. The movie's called ""The Witch."") One of the best horror movies of the year, this should nonetheless be watched only if you're patient and adventurous. It's slow and everyone speaks in 17th-century English, so unless you have the subtitles on, you'll miss a third of what is being said. It's a film full of more dread than frights.

0,2016-09-02," Saddle Up: As any observer of the best-seller lists can tell you, World War II exerts a deep hold on the popular imagination. Lately, though, readers seem less interested in the Nazis' human victims than in the quirky corners of the war. A couple of years ago, Robert M. Edsel (and his co-writer, Bret Witter) spent 21 weeks on the paperback nonfiction list with ""The Monuments Men,"" about Allied efforts to retrieve looted art from the Germans; now Elizabeth Letts's ""The Perfect Horse"" — No. 17 on the extended hardcover nonfiction list — tells a similar story about the mission to save a breed of horses, the noble Lipizzaner stallions, that the Nazis abducted to create a ""master race"" of war animals. General Patton himself approved the rescue: ""Get them. Make it fast,"" the book quotes him saying. But why divert military resources to protect horses, however mighty? According to an essay Letts wrote for the ­Amazon blog Omnivoracious, the answer lies with the Army's legacy of training cavalry officers. ""Turns out, the interwar years are called the cavalry's golden age,"" she says. ""Army-bred horses won Olympic medals and Army-trained riders shone in international competitions. To belong to the U.S. Cavalry was to be a skilled rider. It was also to be trained in a code of honor known to cavalries around the world: Always take care of your horse first. In the last days of World War II, the world's most priceless purebreds were in danger of being slaughtered for food. Their only hope was a group of American soldiers who by chance were camped out nearby. As it happened, these were the soldiers of the Second Cavalry — one of America's most storied mounted units, and one of the last to be mechanized. . . . As Patton liked to remind people, many of the most celebrated leaders in World War II got their start as cavalry officers, and in the last days of the war, when the priceless purebreds were in danger, these men remembered the lesson to put the horses first."" Letts is, no surprise, a horse lover herself: Her previous best seller, ""The Eighty-Dollar Champion,"" was about the show jumper Snowman, and in her Twitter biography she admits she ""never got over Black Beauty."" Machine Learning: Best-selling novels are not infrequently said to be formulaic. But what if there's an actual formula — a pattern to the list that can be modeled by a computer algorithm to predict which novels have the highest chance of success? According to the authors Jodie Archer and Matthew L. Jockers, there is one, and they set out to explain it in ""The Bestseller Code,"" their new book. ""The kind of reading that computers can do,"" they write in the first chapter, ""gets us closer to the details of a novel than even some of the most practiced literary critics."" That may not be as far-fetched as it sounds. I won't give away which novel their ­""bestseller-ometer"" picked as its favorite, but I will say neither ""The Da Vinci Code"" nor ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" made the top 100."
0,2016-09-03," For eight years, Peter Coles had an economist's dream job at Harvard Business School. His research focused on the design of efficient markets, an important and growing field that has influenced such things as Treasury bill auctions and decisions on who receives organ transplants. He even got to work with Alvin E. Roth, who won a Nobel in economic science in 2012. But prestige was not enough to keep Mr. Coles at Harvard. In 2013, he moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. He now works at Airbnb, the online lodging marketplace, one of a number of tech companies luring economists with the promise of big sets of data and big salaries. Silicon Valley is turning to the dismal science in its never-ending quest to squeeze more money out of old markets and build new ones. In turn, the economists say they are eager to explore the digital world for fresh insights into timeless economic questions of pricing, incentives and behavior. ""It's an absolute candy store for economists,"" Mr. Coles said. The pay, of course, is a lot better than you would find in academia, where economists typically earn $125,000 to $150,000 a year. In tech companies, pay for a Ph.D. economist will usually come in at more than $200,000 a year, the companies say. With bonuses and stock grants, compensation can easily double in a few years. Senior economists who manage teams can make even more. Businesses have been hiring economists for years. Usually, they are asked to study macroeconomic trends — topics like recessions and currency exchange rates — and help their employers deal with them. But what the tech economists are doing is different: Instead of thinking about national or global trends, they are studying the data trails of consumer behavior to help digital companies make smart decisions that strengthen their online marketplaces in areas like advertising, movies, music, travel and lodging. Tech outfits including giants like Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft and up-and-comers like Airbnb and Uber hope that sort of improved efficiency means more profit. At Netflix, Randall Lewis, an economic research scientist, is finely measuring the effectiveness of advertising. His work also gets at the correlation-or-causation conundrum in economic behavior: What consumer actions occur coincidentally after people see ads, and what actions are most likely caused by the ads? At Airbnb, Mr. Coles is researching the company's marketplace of hosts and guests for insights, both to help build the business and to understand behavior. One study focuses on procrastination — a subject of great interest to behavioral economists — by looking at bookings. Are they last-minute? Made weeks or months in advance? Do booking habits change by age, gender or country of origin? ""They are microeconomic experts, heavy on data and computing tools like machine learning and writing algorithms,"" said Tom Beers, executive director of the National Association for Business Economics. Understanding how digital markets work is getting a lot of attention now, said Hal Varian, Google's chief economist. But, he said, ""I thought it was fascinating years ago."" Mr. Varian, 69, is the godfather of the tech industry's in-house economists. Once a well-known professor at the University of California, Berkeley, Mr. Varian showed up at Google in 2002, part time at first, but soon became an employee. He helped refine Google's AdWords marketplace, where advertisers bid to have their ads shown on search pages, based on the words users type into Google's search engine. Google's insight was to avoid giving the best ad placement to the highest bidder. Mr. Varian worked to develop a different model for ad placement, calculating the probability that a user will click on an ad and find the ad relevant. It was a classic example of smart market design. Since then, Mr. Varian and his team have applied their economic perspective to Google's ad markets, the company's unusual auction for its initial public offering, bidding strategies for wireless spectrum, patent auctions and purchases, and models for new businesses like driverless cars. For the moment, Amazon seems to be the most aggressive recruiter of economists. It even has an Amazon Economists website for soliciting résumés. In a video on the site, Patrick Bajari, the company's chief economist, says the economics team has contributed to decisions that have had ""multibillion-dollar impacts"" for the company. Another Amazon jobs site lists openings for economists. As of Friday, there were 34. Seeing this emerging job market, the National Association for Business Economics held its first meeting for technology company economists in April in San Francisco. Another is set for October in Silicon Valley. Academia is also starting to take notice — and adapt. ""It's all happening so fast, it's hard to keep up,"" said Susan Athey, an expert in the economics of technology at the Stanford Graduate School of Business who is also a consultant to Microsoft. Many economics students also take computer science courses, and some major in both. But a new course this fall at Yale, called Designing the Digital Economy, seeks to blend economics and computer science in the way digital economists do at tech companies. The instructor is Glen Weyl, an economist at Microsoft Research, and the course will have guest lecturers from Amazon, Pandora and Uber. The course is a pilot for curriculum change and perhaps a joint degree program focused on digital markets and their design. Dirk Bergemann, chairman of the Yale economics department, explained that economics was concerned with efficiency, prices and incentives, while computer science focused on algorithms and complexity. ""In digital marketplaces, you are trying to address both sets of problems,"" he said. Mr. Weyl predicts that the rise of digital marketplaces in the economy is just getting underway. Uber in ride-hailing and Airbnb in room-renting, he said, may well be just the start of a redefinition of private property, made possible by digital technology. Things, according to Mr. Weyl, will increasingly be rented as services instead of owned. That is the long-term vision of driverless cars: When a vehicle just shows up on command, far fewer cars will sit in driveways. Transportation efficiency, resource consumption and industries will all be transformed, he said. The same could be true for household goods, Mr. Weyl said. One possible situation: After you use your espresso machine for breakfast, a drone comes to pick it up, and you rent it out for the day. A current market-design challenge for Amazon and Microsoft is their big cloud computing services. These digital services, for example, face a peak-load problem, much as electric utilities do. How do you sell service at times when there is a risk some customers may be bumped off? Run an auction for what customers are willing to pay for interruptible service? Or offer set discounts for different levels of risk? Both Amazon and Microsoft are working on that now. To answer such questions, economists work in teams with computer scientists and people in business. In tech companies, market design involves not only economics but also engineering and marketing. How hard is a certain approach technically? How easy is it to explain to customers? ""Economics influences rather than determines decisions,"" said Preston McAfee, Microsoft's chief economist, who previously worked at Google and Yahoo."

0,2016-09-06," During the debate over Obamacare, both supporters and opponents assumed the giant law would transform the American health care system. The supporters argued that the system would help Americans purchase health insurance through carefully regulated state exchanges. President Obama envisioned a day when consumers could shop for health coverage ""the same way you'd shop for a plane ticket on Kayak or a TV on Amazon."" In 2010, the Congressional Budget Office estimated there would be 21 million Americans using the exchanges by now. Many supporters argued that the exchanges would eventually replace the current dominant employer-based system. The promise of Obamacare was that it would foster competition and offer lower premiums while covering tens of millions of Americans without, as Obama often put it, adding a dime to the deficit. Unfortunately, most of the exchanges are in serious trouble. As many critics pointed out at the time, the law is poorly designed to induce younger, healthier people to get into the system. The penalties attached to the individual mandate are too weak. The subsidies are too small. The premiums are too costly. The deductibles are too high. Many doctors aren't participating in the networks. Only about 12 million people are in exchanges. More important, the exchanges are attracting sicker, poorer people, who drain money, and are not attracting the healthier people who pour money in. Many insurers are suffering catastrophic losses and pulling out. As James Capretta of the American Enterprise Institute has noted, Aetna has lost $430 million since January 2014 on insurance plans sold through Obamacare and is withdrawing from 11 of its 15 states. United Healthcare has lost $1.3 billion on the exchanges and will cut its participation to three states from 34. That means less coverage; 24 million Americans still lack health insurance. That means less competition. Before too long, a third of the exchanges will have just one insurer in them. That also means higher premiums. Blue Cross Blue Shield has requested a 62 percent increase for next year in Tennessee and an average 65 percent increase in Arizona. Some experts put the national requested increase at 23 percent. The exchanges are also producing less coverage. The insurers that are staying offer pared-down restrictive plans that look more like Medicaid. Does this mean Obamacare is failing? No. The law has produced many positive outcomes across the health care world. More than 20 million more Americans have coverage because of it, and the evidence suggests their health has improved. But it does mean Obamacare is not what we thought it would be. It's a much more modest add-on to the pre-existing system. Sarah Kliff put it well in Vox: ""Obamacare's insurance expansion is on the path to looking like other safety net programs we know, offering limited services to a predominantly low-income population."" Kliff quotes former administration official Michael Adelberg: ""The exchange population — 85 percent of which qualifies for financial assistance — looks a lot like the Medicaid population. And with it, we're seeing the start of the Medicaid-ization of exchange plans: narrow networks with no frills."" Again, this is not bad. But we'd have had a very different debate if we knew the law was going to be a discrete government effort to subsidize health care for more poor people. For one thing, Democrats would have probably paid a much smaller political price if their effort wasn't billed as an extravagant government grab to take over the nation's health care system. The administration imagined something transformational; it ended up with something significant but incremental. There are also lessons for people who think about policy making. First designing technocratic systems that will actually work is really hard. Second, designing effective technocratic systems that can pass politically is really, really hard. Third, designing politically plausible technocratic systems in a country divided on fundamental philosophy is hardness on stilts. Philosophically, Obamacare tried to split the difference between European-style government coercion (the individual mandates) with a traditionally American respect for competition and freedom of choice (the exchanges). But lawmakers couldn't stomach a law involving forceful coercion (punishing penalties to make the young take part) and they couldn't stomach a more purely market-based system. They wound up with a nonfunctioning compromise. From here on out the health care debate will return, but in polarized form. Democrats are already really pushing for the public option, a heavier state player. Republicans are pointing out that technocrats are bad at designing dynamic systems and the insurance markets should work more like traditional markets. The next president will have to deal with all this, especially if the exchanges go into a death spiral, even though the subject has been basically ignored in the campaign. It will be hard to govern after a campaign about nothing."
0,2016-09-07," In her 20s, Phoebe Waller-Bridge found herself confused about what makes a good feminist and how much sex women should have. She wove her deliriously smutty preoccupations, along with a wallop of rage, into ""Fleabag,"" a show at the 2013 Edinburgh Festival Fringe that scooped up an Olivier nomination and the Stage award for solo performer. Now 31, Ms. Waller-Bridge is bringing her sexually rapacious, anger-riddled, flailing London cafe owner to a TV series of the same name (it debuts on Amazon on Friday, Sept. 16). Jenny Rainsford plays Boo, Fleabag's dead best friend; Sian Clifford is Claire, her rich sister; and Olivia Colman is their widowed father's horrid artist wife. The series begins with Fleabag arousing herself to a video of President Obama and ends in the key of grief. Since the show's July premiere in Britain, comparisons have abounded — ""Sex and the City,"" ""Inside Amy Schumer"" — with Ms. Waller-Bridge being anointed as one of her generation's funniest, most provocative voices."
0,2016-09-08," It's been said that comedy is tragedy plus time. Lately, it's been more like tragedy minus a half-hour. Many of TV's best, most ambitious recent series — ""Transparent,"" ""Getting On,"" the new ""Atlanta"" — are comedies that share the themes and stakes of drama. That's especially true of ""One Mississippi,"" a tender, occasionally funny, often moving entertainment about the grieving process. Amazon, where the six-episode season appears Friday, describes the series as a ""traumedy."" It leads with the ""trau."" Tig Bavaro (Tig Notaro), a radio host in Los Angeles, returns to Bay St. Lucille, Miss., where her mother, Caroline (Rya Kihlstedt), is being taken off life support. On top of that, Tig is recovering from a double mastectomy. And on top of that, she's coping with a dangerous digestive illness. Laughing yet? You might be, actually, though the laughs generated by the first episode are the cathartic kind, drawing on the disorienting, uncanny experience of confronting the empty shell that used to contain someone you loved. After Tig's mother dies, for instance, Tig fantasizes being told that she has to bring the body home with her. She wheels the deathbed through the hospital corridor as the staff cheer and wish her well. Snapping back to reality, Tig finds herself lost in a hallway. ""I don't know how to leave,"" she tells a nurse. ""One Mississippi"" is about how you can never really leave — not your home, not your good and bad memories, not even the dead and buried. Tig ends up extending her visit as she deals with her mother's estate, confronts buried issues from her past and manages a long-distance relationship with her flighty girlfriend, Brooke (Casey Wilson). The series starts with an ending, then simultaneously moves backward and forward. Ms. Notaro, a comedian, created the series with the screenwriter Diablo Cody, drawing on her autobiographical standup act. The pilot, directed by Nicole Holofcener, is gorgeous, humid with memory, capturing the way a childhood hometown can be a font of both love and anxiety. (Ms. Holofcener is also an executive producer, as is Louis C.K., whose growing mini-empire of not-just-comedies includes FX's ""Baskets"" and ""Better Things,"" as well as his own ""Louie."") If the first half-hour plays like an indie film, the remaining episodes are more TV-series-like, as Tig sets up house with her brother, Remy (Noah Harpster), and her stepfather, Bill (John Rothman). Remy is sweet but emotionally stunted, a middle-aged teacher who hasn't had a girlfriend since high school. Bill is so uptight he considers it cheating to pause a coffee maker to pour a cup before the full pot has brewed. (""I prefer to let the machine complete its process,"" he says.) With shellshocked Tig, the house becomes a halfway home for incomplete adults, absent Caroline, who had been the glue connecting them. Caroline becomes a character, too, a Southern-vivacious life force in flashbacks and fantasies. But as Tig settles her family's affairs, she learns things about her mother that clash with her gauzy memories. ""One Mississippi"" becomes a study of how identity, in a family, is a group project — we often edit our loved ones into the people we want them to be. As can happen when comedians star in series, Ms. Notaro often seems to be narrating her scenes more than experiencing them. She has a low-key charm, but the scenes in which she talks about her life on the radio feel more immediate than Tig's experiences in the moment. There is a power, though, to having Ms. Notaro herself star in this personal story about the fragility of the body, her mother's and her own. (As she has in her standup, she reveals her mastectomy scars to bold effect.) And her supporting cast is strong, especially the terrific Mr. Rothman, who locates the stress fractures of emotion beneath Bill's sheer granite face. The season's arc, in which Tig and Bill confront long-buried family secrets, brings out the best in both performers. ""One Mississippi"" tries to hit many notes in its short run — grief, light comedy, anger, small-town whimsy — and the shifts can be jarring. But if you binge the show at a stretch, the conflicting tones resolve into something like the happy-sad-exhausted emotional overload you feel after a wake. Is that comedy? Tragedy? Mel Brooks, in ""The 2000 Year Old Man,"" once defined the two. ""Tragedy is if I cut my finger,"" he said, adding, ""Comedy is if you walk into an open sewer and die."" For Ms. Notaro, as for many artists in today's confusing, rewarding field of not-just-comedy, the distinctions are not so absolute. Cut fingers or death, it's all material."
1,2016-09-08," SEATTLE — When Amazon introduced its first tablet, it seemed like just another me-too entrant in a hot category pioneered by Apple. The company did nothing to diminish this view when it later came out with a smartphone that bombed so badly it stopped selling the phone a year later. Now, five years after unveiling that first tablet, Amazon is coming out with a new model of the device that takes the company's single-minded obsession with offering the lowest practical price to new extremes. It is doing so at a time when the overall tablet market is no longer the growth juggernaut it once was, with weak sales from the likes of Apple and Samsung. One notable exception to the downward trend is Amazon, which is seeing sales rise because its devices are so inexpensive. ""They're obviously doing something right because they continue to grow in a market that is overall declining,"" said Jitesh Ubrani, an analyst at IDC, the technology research company. The latest Amazon tablet is the Fire HD 8, a new model of the company's 8-inch touch-screen device. The entry-level Fire HD 8 has 50 percent more RAM for loading apps more quickly, longer battery life and 16 gigabytes of storage, double that of the previous model and equal to Apple's 8-inch iPads. Amazon also plans to announce that it is making its Alexa digital assistant available on all of its tablets. The most remarkable thing about the device is the price, which, at $89.99, represents a 40 percent drop from the previous 8-inch Fire's price of $149.99. More striking is the contrast to Apple's 8-inch iPads, which start at $399 for the latest generation and $269 for an earlier model. There is nothing new about Amazon's fixation on undercutting its competitors on price. In tablets, it has seemed more aggressive about lowering prices. Last year, it introduced a 7-inch tablet that sells for $49.99, a few dollars more than Apple charges for a leather iPhone case. The success of that low-price Fire device provided a big lift to Amazon's tablet sales, which have more than doubled on a unit basis this year compared with the same period last year, said Kevin Keith, general manager of Amazon's Fire tablet business. The global tablet market is no longer a growth business, falling 11.1 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, according to IDC. Amazon ranked fifth during that period, accounting for 4.1 percent of sales, IDC estimates. Apple — the top tablet maker — has reported that the number of iPads it sold during that period fell 9 percent, though its iPad revenue rose 7 percent because of sales of high-end versions. If Amazon's approach to tablet pricing sounds unprofitable, that is because it is, at least directly. The company views them as a way to entice people to become more enthusiastic Amazon customers by, for example, encouraging the purchase of $99-a-year Prime memberships, which include a Netflix-like video service, music and other forms of entertainment that can be consumed on the devices. ""We aim to break even on our hardware and make money when customers use our devices, not when we sell devices,"" said Mr. Keith. ""We feel like that's a great model for our business."" Amazon squeezes additional revenue out of its tablets in other ways, too. It sends advertisements to the lock screens of Fire tablets. If customers do not want to see the ads, they can pay Amazon $15 to remove them. This is not something Apple is likely to do, and die-hard fans of the iPad, which many say has a polish that other tablets lack, will not be swayed merely by price. Despite the overall decline in the market, Amazon's Mr. Keith says he thinks there are still opportunities for Amazon tablet sales to grow. Its prices are low enough that Amazon customers are buying multiple tablets for their homes and giving them as gifts. ""We don't think the market is saturated yet,"" he said. ""We have plenty of runway."""
2,2016-09-08," Judith Light is enjoying the kind of career she deserves. In other words, at 67, she gets to work as much as she likes, she gets an early crack at quality roles, she is nominated for awards (and wins some) in each medium she tackles, and she is ""beloved wherever she goes."" (That last remark comes from Jill Soloway, the creator of the breakthrough Amazon series ""Transparent,"" for which Ms. Light is up for an Emmy.) So why would she decide to collaborate with Neil LaBute, that gnarly playwright of unlovable characters? Was life just too easy for her? For the last couple of years, Ms. Light has been parsing a complicated role as Shelly Pfefferman, the self-absorbed mother of three remarkably unfinished adult children, whose ex-husband, played by Jeffrey Tambor, is a transgender woman. ""Transparent"" may be considered a comedy during awards season, but it is also a profoundly honest and often heartbreaking story of an upper-middle-class Jewish family in Los Angeles. Season 3 begins on Sept. 23. In the meantime, Ms. Light finds herself in a cluttered rehearsal space above Eighth Avenue, preparing for the MCC Theater production of Mr. LaBute's new play, ""All the Ways to Say I Love You,"" which is in previews and opens Sept. 28. It is a solo piece in which her character, a former schoolteacher blandly known as Mrs. Johnson, tries to justify her behavior to herself — and to us. (The run has already been extended to Oct. 16; then Shelly Pfefferman has to move back to Marina del Rey to shoot Season 4, bubbeleh.) Ms. Light has a longstanding relationship with MCC, which partly explains why she's returning to Off Broadway after four Broadway commitments, two of which — ""Other Desert Cities"" and ""The Assembled Parties"" — won her back-to-back Tonys in 2012 and 2013. But as has become her way, it's the chance to take on a challenging, many-layered role that has her enticed. ""Each character I play,"" she explained, ""I have to wake up inside me."" She is tinier in person than onscreen, her giant brown eyes seemingly bigger than her waist, her straight blond hair showing just a whisper of beach curl. Even on a warm day, her black turtleneck looks uncommonly chic. She offers the greatest hits of rehearsal foods to her visitor: ""Did you say iced coffee? We have it. It's good here. I think you want it iced."" People speak of gratitude easily — we hear of gratitude diaries, daily affirmations — but when Ms. Light expresses thanks for her fortune, it feels real. She is at an age when so many performers are frustrated and unemployed, and she has the luxury of scheduling one job after another. Yet listening to her describe her work, she sounds as much an analysand as a performer. ""As a society, we judge ourselves over and over again — we don't accept our flaws,"" she explained. Consequently, it behooves an actor to think ""you are always your character's best friend."" Enter the very flawed, very LaButean Mrs. Johnson. (Let's reveal no more.) ""All the Ways to Say I Love You"" is a 25-page, single-spaced monologue, which doesn't allow her the luxury to play off other actors, as she did to memorable effect as the world-weary truth-tellers in her Tony-winning roles. She recorded the text and listens to it as she goes to sleep — no pleasure given the subject matter. ""This play is about lies — turning ourselves inside out and about how far one goes for a man,"" she explained. Why do it, then? ""I take things that are difficult,"" she said simply. This willingness to change course goes way back. As a theater graduate of Carnegie Mellon University, Ms. Light announced to her parents that she would not consider working in soap operas. Then came a role in ""One Life to Live,"" as a housewife who became a part-time prostitute. It was a career-making hit with the audience and earned her two Emmys. ""I learned so much there, when I stopped being condescending,"" she said. ""I swore I'd never do a sitcom,"" she continued. ""I was a woman of my word,"" she laughed ruefully, indicating the next eight years, in which she starred with Tony Danza in ""Who's the Boss"" for ABC. ""I stopped being prejudicial,"" she said. It was her longtime manager, Herb Hamsher, who suggested that she return to the theater after these two long runs. His message, she said, was ""if you want to stay in this business, you have to change people's impressions of you."" She stalled. She meditated. She liked living in Los Angeles with her husband, Robert Desiderio. Mr. Hamsher told her what she probably knew but wouldn't admit, that she was scared to be back onstage, where cameras and retakes and editing don't exist. Ms. Light went to a ""meditative yoga ladies' camp"" to consider it further. She thought about the fear she felt about her career in relation to the boldness with which she advocated for the gay and lesbian community at the height of the AIDS pandemic. ""I don't like who I am,'' she said to herself. ""I'm going to audition for the next play that comes my way."" Fortunately, that audition happened to be for ""Wit,"" the 1999 Pulitzer Prize-winner. Ms. Light hadn't been onstage in 22 years but got the chance to take over the leading role from the much-praised Kathleen Chalfant. Compared with the comedy for which she was so well known, ""Wit"" was a drama about a serious scholar — unmarried, unattached and unsentimental — with terminal ovarian cancer. (Spoiler alert: It doesn't end well.) Could she imagine a tougher transformation? Ms. Light shaved off her glamorous golden hair and bared her soul; she spent a year as Vivian Bearing, both in New York and on a national tour, which included a run at the Kennedy Center in Washington. ""'Wit' transformed my life,"" she said. ""For the theater community to see me, believe in me — they allowed me to believe in myself, and they received me really warmly in a way that I had forgotten."" Her latest forte has been playing Jewish mothers. She's not a mother herself, but she is Jewish — which came as a surprise to Ms. Soloway, the creator of ""Transparent,"" who said, ""I thought she was a shiksa princess."" ""We're all her babies,"" Ms. Soloway said by telephone. ""I don't know if we're the only family she bestows this Jewish maternal love on. I got a bee sting once on location, and she healed me with reiki."" Ms. Light pushed to be part of ""Transparent"" as an outgrowth of her commitment to gay and lesbian equality. ""I wanted this job so badly,'' she said. It was a chance to act opposite Mr. Tambor, too: ""We hadn't worked together since we were kids at the Milwaukee Rep."" While it requires her to tuck her hair into a sensible wig, the series has shown her character to be hungry for affection, most famously in a bathtub scene in the episode ""Flicky-Flicky Thump-Thump,"" when Shelly becomes intimate once more with her ex. It's been a joy offscreen, too. ""Jill creates the best working environment,'' Ms. Light explained. ""We begin the day with the whole cast and crew. It's a time to have a laugh or cry. Then we have the safest space. No one is told they're wrong or made a mistake."" Her Off Broadway stage challenge is thornier. But it's her choice to take it, and her choice to leave it behind. ""My job is to give the best performance,"" Ms. Light said. ""We will have an experience together. I will have told them what Mrs. Johnson needed to say. Then I'll take off my costume and wig, and I might see a friend, or I might go home and take a bath."" No matter what comes next, ""I'll be grateful."""
0,2016-09-11," How much are people willing to spend for streaming music? For years, thanks to rigid pricing structures at streaming services, the answer has been stuck at $10 a month or nothing. But that model may soon be challenged by two giants of online media: Amazon and Pandora Media. Both companies are set to introduce new versions of their streaming services in coming weeks, charging as little as $5 a month, according to multiple people with direct knowledge of the plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the process was ongoing. The plans will put pressure on incumbent players like Spotify and Apple Music and offer the music industry a major test regarding the value of streaming music — including the crucial question of whether discounts will be enough to entice people to pay anything when virtually every song is also available free. The pricing model of $10 a month, the standard rate charged by most on-demand streaming services, has been compared to the 99 cents that Apple charged for song downloads when it opened the iTunes music store in 2003 — a simple and comprehensible amount that established in consumers' minds the value of music in the internet age. But many in the business have argued that $10 a month is too high for casual listeners. At $120 a year, it costs more than most people have historically paid for music. According to MusicWatch, a market research firm, the average music customer in the United States will pay about $67 this year on recorded music, up from $55 last year but down from $80 in 1999, around the peak of the CD market. ""Even with the presence of free, you can still get tens of millions to pay for streaming services — and possibly much more — in the event that you get the price much lower,"" said David Pakman, a venture capitalist and former digital music executive who has long argued that lower prices would lead to greater sales over all. The streaming market is divided between internet radio services like Pandora, which offer songs tailored to listeners' tastes but do not let them choose exactly what songs to hear, and so-called on-demand services, like Spotify and Apple Music, which let users pick specific songs and create playlists. Pandora is expected to make the first move by unveiling, perhaps as early as this week, an expanded version of its $5 subscription platform. That service, which is currently limited to removing ads on its internet radio streams, will soon begin offering customers new features like the ability to skip more unwanted songs and store several hours' worth of playlists online, according to three people with direct knowledge of the company's plans. By Christmas, according to these people, Pandora wants to introduce a fully developed competitor to Spotify and Apple Music, with a catalog of tens of millions of songs that a listener can gain access to on demand. That version is expected to cost $10 a month, in line with the current market. Amazon's ambitions may pose more of a challenge to the existing services. The company already offers a limited catalog of on-demand music to members of its Prime program, which costs $99 a year for free shipping, streaming movies and other perks. But in coming weeks, Amazon is also expected to introduce a music service with a full catalog, charging $10 a month or about half that amount for customers who use the Echo, Amazon's voice-activated speaker system, according to several people who have been briefed on the plans. For both companies, the new streaming offerings represent variations on the existing models, with a mix of new features that are intended to entice casual listeners into paying a minimal fee without eroding the ranks of customers who are willing to pay more. Amazon and Pandora have spent months negotiating new licensing terms with record companies and music publishers to allow their new streaming offerings, and they are close to completing those deals, according to the people briefed on the plans. Representatives of both companies declined to comment. To some degree, these deals reflect a new willingness among the major record companies to experiment with pricing and shore up a wide field of competitors. Just last year, when Apple was negotiating with record labels over Apple Music, its streaming service, the company wanted to charge customers $8 a month. But the labels balked and held out for $10, giving Apple no price advantage over competitors like Spotify, Rhapsody and Deezer. That episode, technology executives say, was a window into a little-understood reality of the streaming business: that prices are indirectly enforced through the licensing contracts that services sign with record companies. Yet while the headline prices have been stuck at $10 a month, analysts and music executives say that a range of discounts and promotions has made it difficult to gauge what customers are really willing to pay. Most offer family plans, student discounts and introductory trials. Other services have also made brief and inconclusive attempts to offer online music at lower prices. Last year Rdio, a struggling streaming outlet, introduced a $4 subscription plan that let users listen to 25 songs of their choosing each month. But by the end of the year the company had gone bankrupt, and its assets were acquired by Pandora. Another service, Cür Media, announced its intentions this year to introduce limited streaming plans for as little as $2 a month. But by the summer, it appeared that the company had been unable to raise the $15 million that it said it needed for expenses like licensing deals with record companies. Last month, in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Cür Media reported that it had laid off all of its employees, and that its chairman and chief executive had resigned. Attempts in recent days to reach any representatives of the company were unsuccessful. Major corporate players like Amazon and Pandora do not face such basic questions of financial viability. But there are still doubts about whether lower price points will make any difference to consumers. YouTube makes virtually any song available free, and, much to the chagrin of the record companies, it is widely considered the most popular online source for music around the world. Spotify, in addition to its $10 premium service, also has a free version supported by advertising. Russ Crupnick, the managing partner of MusicWatch, the market research company, said his research showed that subscribers to premium services like Spotify were pleased with the product and willing to pay. Furthermore, such customers were also likely to pay for other media subscriptions, like to Netflix, Showtime and so on. But for less engaged consumers, he said, particularly those who are satisfied with radio or free streaming on YouTube, it may take much more to get them to buy a subscription. ""I don't know that you get the casual listener to automatically be a superfan just by lowering the price,"" Mr. Crupnick said."
0,2016-09-12," You can buy ""Trump That Bitch"" buttons and T-shirts on Amazon to show your disdain for Hillary Clinton. You can hear the word shouted at rallies for Donald J. Trump and spread across Twitter. At one event last month, a school-aged boy standing with his mother yelled out, ""Take the bitch down."" Now, you can see the word applied to Clinton in a headline on the Opinion pages of The New York Times: ""The Bitch America Needs."" Those words appeared over the weekend above a piece that tried to reclaim that particular bit of obscenity from those trying to degrade women with it. ""For more than 20 years in American politics, Mrs. Clinton has embodied what we might call Classic Bitch,"" wrote Andi Zeisler, founder of a feminist organization, appropriately named Bitch Media. ""She's perceived as an interloper who challenges or threatens masculinity, entitlement and a status-quo worldview; she's the scandal magnet who can seem as heartless and venal as any old-boy's-club member. Worst of all, she's the woman who accepts that she will be disliked and carries on anyway."" Zeisler wrote a provocative piece, with plenty of good political history on the word, including its use against Clinton back in 2007, when someone at a public forum asked Senator John McCain, ""How do we beat the bitch?"" McCain responded, ""Excellent question."" Zeisler's piece was an interesting read, strongly pro-Clinton, and pro-feminist. But several readers took issue both with the headline and the editors' decision to use it. This one from Paula DiPerna of New York City was typical: ""I know the piece is mere opinion, but it nevertheless represents a new low in titillation journalism, as if written by a gleeful child who just got permission to use curse words. It is a disservice to the idea of public good in that, disguised as feminism, it actually delivers nothing but tweet fodder to anti-Clinton forces."" I sought out the Opinion editor Rachel Dry to ask her how the essay came about as well as the concerns highlighted in DiPerna's letter, some of which I share. Dry says she commissioned the piece because she wanted someone to wrestle with how this particular profanity is being used against Clinton. ""Certainly the word focuses one's attention,"" Dry said to my questions about its use in the headline and so frequently in the story. ""But that's what the essay is about."" I did find the essay readable and smart, and given that the Op-Ed pages are intended to throw out the welcome mat to all views, it's hard to argue that this wasn't a worthy offering. But I too was jolted by the headline. Have we really reached the point that it's O.K. for The Times to refer to Clinton in bold type as ""The Bitch America Needs""? Dry said she was unaware of a previous time when the word was used in a headline. What bothered me about the headline was that it seemed to come from the voice of The Times, at least when you come on it cold, as all readers do. It's one thing for an author, under her own byline and in the context of her ideas, to write the type of opinion piece Zeisler did. But the word bitch — particularly when it's lobbed at you across a room or on the street or in social media — is surely intended as crude and demeaning. I suspect that's the same way Trump supporters use it. And it seems to be the way the Clinton campaign takes it, as it has made clear in the past. Dry says that when opinion editors write the headlines, they are distilling the author's perspective, not the view or the voice of The Times. That may be, but referring to the first female presidential nominee as the right bitch for the job brings an air of legitimacy to the word that seems beyond where we are at this moment in history. The mainstream may someday apply this term to women who stand up for themselves and bust through feminine stereotypes. Until then, it remains an insult, degrading and misogynistic."
1,2016-09-12," Blue Origin, the secretive space company created by Jeffrey P. Bezos, offered a look at its newest rocket design on Monday — and, by extension, its ambitions to make space travel more frequent and inexpensive. Both the rocket and the ambitions appear to be big. The rockets, named New Glenn after John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth, are almost as large as the Saturn V rocket that NASA used from 1966 to 1973, before rockets started being built smaller. The two-stage version that could venture to low-Earth orbit will be 270 feet tall, and the three-stage version, which could fly outside Earth's orbit, will be 313 feet tall. Both will be 23 feet in diameter, packing seven BE-4 engines, which are developed by Blue Origin, and lifting off with 3.85 million pounds of thrust. Blue Origin plans to first launch the rocket from Launch Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral, Fla., before the end of the decade. ""Our vision is millions of people living and working in space, and New Glenn is a very important step,"" Mr. Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, said in an email update. As a private company, Blue Origin could launch wealthy tourists into space, send commercial satellites into orbit and provide the technology to send NASA back to the moon, as well as to Mars and beyond. Perfecting the technology of reusable rockets — which the New Glenn rockets would be — could have profound implications on the cost and frequency of space travel. Imagine how much more expensive a flight from New York to London would be if airlines built a new 747 jet for each flight, throwing them away after one use. That is effectively the current model of the space industry; rockets typically crash back into Earth after exhausting their fuel, and the steep costs of travel depress how often it happens. ""Reusability is a total game-changer,"" said Charles Miller, the president of NexGen Space L.L.C., a space and public policy consultancy. ""It's on the order of going from the sail to the steam engine, or going from the horse to the automobile."" Blue Origin first launched its reusable New Shepard rocket from West Texas in November, sending a capsule that would eventually carry paying passengers to a height of 329,839 feet, just crossing the 100-kilometer line that is considered the beginning of outer space. Before New Glenn was announced as the rocket's name on Monday, Mr. Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, had referred to it as ""Very Big Brother."" The large size of New Glenn — Mr. Miller, a former senior adviser for NASA, had guessed it would be big but thought it would have five engines, not seven — suggests the company would seek to lower the price of space tourism by offering more seats on the flights, he said. In March, Mr. Bezos said that tourists could make short trips into space, experiencing a few minutes of weightlessness, as soon as 2018 via the reusable New Shepard spacecraft. The experience would doubtlessly be reserved for the rich, at least initially, but Mr. Bezos said it would be necessary to build expertise and further develop the technology. Though the company was registered in 2000, Mr. Bezos had not let reporters into its headquarters in Kent, Wash., until March of this year. In September 2015, Blue Origin said it would invest $200 million and create 330 jobs by leasing a launch complex at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Mr. Miller said if the dream of inexpensive space travel were fulfilled, it would significantly impact life on Earth. In best-case scenarios, the ability to more easily launch satellites could lead to worldwide broadband internet, better weather predictions, the monitoring of carbon sources and the farming of solar energy. For the United States, it could have national security implications, he said. The ability to destroy United States satellites that provide surveillance and guide missiles is a current liability, but enemies may be less likely to target them if they could be quickly replaced. And NASA will most likely be a customer, using the New Glenn rockets for future missions. ""With this vehicle, going to Mars will become a lot easier,"" Mr. Miller said."
0,2016-09-14," Twitter is making a play for people's living rooms, unveiling an app on Wednesday for Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV and Microsoft's Xbox One that will showcase its bet on live content. Twitter's new free app includes live streams of 10 National Football League Thursday night games, and all live videos from MLB Advanced Media, the National Basketball Association, Pac-12 Networks, Campus Insiders, Bloomberg News and the business news start-up Cheddar. ""We're excited to introduce this new experience to people, without requiring a pay wall or having to log in to Twitter,"" Anthony Noto, chief financial officer of Twitter, said in a statement. Twitter, the social media company, wants to draw a large mainstream audience with live-streamed television events after struggling to increase its user base. It also is betting that a larger audience will make it more attractive for advertisers, especially for online video ads, which command a premium. Twitter has bet big on this live-streaming vision. This spring, Twitter beat Facebook and other technology companies to win the rights to live stream the N.F.L. games on Thursday nights. Twitter agreed to pay the league around $1 million a game and to let the N.F.L. handle some of the ad sales. Mr. Noto once was the N.F.L.'s chief financial officer. Last season, each Thursday night football game drew an average of 13 million viewers. Twitter will stream its first N.F.L. game on Thursday. Twitter's new app will be available in select markets starting Wednesday. Apple TV users will also be able to see live premium video and video clips posted on Twitter side-by-side."
0,2016-09-15," A couple of things about ""Fleabag,"" Phoebe Waller-Bridge's new series available on Friday on Amazon. It's an angry-young-woman sitcom, as biting and bitter as it is funny. And it's based on a play Ms. Waller-Bridge performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2013, which may have something to do with why it doesn't quite feel like anything else on television. It's not the events of ""Fleabag"" that distinguish it. (The title is the nickname of the main character, who otherwise remains nameless.) Ms. Waller-Bridge, who writes the show and plays Fleabag, may push the boundaries on sex — those who have a problem with anal intercourse as a comic device are advised to be on guard — and on her character's propensity for self-centered, self-destructive behavior. In dramatic terms, though, the show, which ran on BBC3 this summer, doesn't break new ground. Over six episodes, Fleabag, the proprietor of a failing cafe, applies for a business loan, clashes with her politely hideous stepmother (a hilarious Olivia Colman), does a love-hate dance with her seemingly more put-together older sister (Sian Clifford, who's dour perfection), and juggles a buffoonish boyfriend and a good-looking, sexually eager hookup. Throughout the season, she has flash memories of a tragedy, mysterious but easy enough to figure out, involving a former friend and business partner. What sets the show apart isn't the surface quality of its humor but its restless, almost feral energy and its slap-in-the-face attitude. Ms. Waller-Bridge knows how to combine naked confessionalism and comic artifice, and it allows her to tap veins of honest emotion — anger, fear and particularly deep sadness — rarely felt in half-hour comedies. She's not averse to having Fleabag walk into conventional, potentially sentimental situations, like a possible reconciliation with her disappointed father (Bill Paterson) or a sudden reversal of fortune with a man she was counting on. But they play out in abrupt, uncomfortable ways that reflect the confusion and desperation that coexist with Fleabag's headstrong independence. Not all of Ms. Waller-Bridge's ideas work. She accentuates Fleabag's self-consciousness and theatricality by not just talking into the camera, but silently looking into it on a regular basis, arching her brows or throwing a look of incomprehension at the ceaseless irritation other humans cause her. At first it's cute, but it loses its effect, becoming a kind of silent laugh track. And the running thread involving the former friend is a drag — you see how it works thematically, emphasizing the harm women can do to other women, but it's the one part of the show that feels forced. They're small quibbles, though, given the sharpness of Ms. Waller-Bridge's writing and the quality of the cast. Ms. Colman and Mr. Paterson are at the top rank of British character actors, and Ms. Colman is especially good here as an artist who, through manipulation, arrogance and actual talent, has negotiated life in a way that Fleabag despises and wishes, helplessly, that she could emulate. Ms. Clifford, a stage actress who hasn't done much TV, is utterly believable as the older sister whose business success and good looks make her an object of jealousy but don't, in the final analysis, protect her. ""Fleabag"" is a binger's dream — you can dispatch the first season in under three hours and be tweeting about it before you go to bed. Will there be a second? The BBC hasn't announced anything yet. Now that deserves a big eyeroll right into the camera."
0,2016-09-16," The peak-TV bubble shows no signs of bursting: For this preview, we considered more than 125 scripted programs, new and old, that will have their premieres by the end of the year. Most of the new ones are listed here, along with a few of the more prominent returnees. The buzziest shows? They're on Netflix (""Black Mirror,"" ""Easy"") and Amazon (""Transparent,"" ""Crisis in Six Scenes""), as we've quickly come to expect.  Dates are subject to change.  September(CBS THE BIG BANG THEORY (CBS, Sept. 19) TV's highest-rated sitcom begins its 10th season by adding Katey Sagal and Jack McBrayer as the mother and brother of Kaley Cuoco's Penny. KEVIN CAN WAIT (CBS, Sept. 19) Kevin James (""The King of Queens"") couldn't wait to headline another sitcom in which he plays a New York public servant (a cop this time) with a counterintuitively attractive wife (Erinn James). THE GOOD PLACE (NBC, Sept. 19) A woman (Kristen Bell) wakes up in heaven, which looks like a cross between a Disney theme park, a planned community and a politically correct college campus, and realizes she's not supposed to be there. Ted Danson stars as her bow-tied angel in this satire from Michael Schur, a producer on ""Parks and Recreation"" and ""Master of None."" BULL (CBS, Sept. 20) Phil McGraw (a.k.a. Dr. Phil) should be flattered that he's being played in this new drama (based on his early days as a psychologist and legal consultant) by Michael Weatherly, who is coming off 13 seasons as the hunky Tony DiNozzo on ""NCIS."" NCIS (CBS, Sept. 20) The perennially popular naval detectives have dropped more than four million viewers from their peak, but they return for their 14th season with a two-season renewal. The original cast member Michael Weatherly has left, while Jennifer Esposito and Wilmer Valderrama have signed on. THIS IS US (NBC, Sept. 20) Dan Fogelman, whose record is spotty but interesting (""Galavant,"" the screenplay of ""Crazy, Stupid, Love""), created this connected-lives-of-complete-strangers series. The gimmick: They all have the same birthday, so the Hallmark vibe of the pilot kind of makes sense. BLACK-ISH (ABC, Sept. 21) ABC's African-American family comedy could start its third season on quite a high note: three days before its premiere, it will compete for best comedy series and best actor in a comedy (Anthony Anderson) at the Emmys. DESIGNATED SURVIVOR (ABC, Sept. 21) Kiefer Sutherland's new show moves even faster than ""24"": In the first episode, the entire White House administration is wiped out except for the secretary of Housing and Urban Development (Mr. Sutherland), who becomes president. With Maggie Q and Kal Penn. EMPIRE (Fox, Sept. 21) Lee Daniels's lavishly melodramatic hip-hop soap opera, a ratings dynamo in its first season, was down significantly in its second but still near the top of the charts. Mariah Carey and the rappers French Montana and Birdman will make appearances in Season 3. LETHAL WEAPON (Fox, Sept. 21) This remake of the 1987 buddy-cop film stars Clayne Crawford (""Rectify"") as a down-home version of Mel Gibson's possibly suicidal wack job and Damon Wayans as a more broadly comic version of Danny Glover's nervous family man. SPEECHLESS (ABC, Sept. 21) Minnie Driver stars as the overbearing matriarch of a sitcom family that stands out for many reasons, not the least of which is the youngest child (Micah Fowler), who has cerebral palsy and doesn't speak. It's a little like a comic version of Ms. Driver's previous series, ""The Riches,"" but a little more like the British show ""Raised by Wolves."" EASY (Netflix, Sept. 22) The indie director Joe Swanberg attracted an interesting cast for his loosely interwoven, eight-episode anthology about love and sex in contemporary Chicago, including Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Raul Castillo, Malin Akerman, Orlando Bloom, Hannibal Buress and Jane Adams. NOTORIOUS (ABC, Sept. 22) Piper Perabo and Daniel Sunjata play a television news producer and a high-profile criminal lawyer with a mutually beneficial relationship, roles based on the ""Larry King Live"" producer Wendy Walker and the lawyer Mark Geragos, who benefited from the Scott Peterson case. (They're also benefiting as executive producers of the show.) PITCH (Fox, Sept. 22) There is crying in baseball in this inspirational, sentimental drama about the first female player in the major leagues (Kylie Bunbury of ""Twisted""). LONGMIRE (Netflix, Sept. 23) Give Netflix credit for keeping this old-fashioned modern western alive. It's not a revolutionary show, but it is among the few series that live up to the description ""character-driven."" Fan service: In the Season 5 premiere, Vic (Katee Sackhoff) helps a wounded Walt (Robert Taylor) change his pants. MacGYVER (CBS, Sept. 23) The handyman of action heroes returns in a reboot of the ABC series (1985-1992), this time played by Lucas Till (Havok in the ""X-Men"" movies). In the spirit of tinkering, CBS scrapped the first pilot and reshot it. THE EXORCIST (Fox, Sept. 23) ""Demons aren't real,"" says the young priest (Alfonso Herrera). So why is that raven trying to fly through the window? And what about the hounds! Ben Daniels also stars, as the obsessive older priest, in a series based on the 1973 film. TRANSPARENT (Amazon, Sept. 23) The long-running gender transition of Maura Pfefferman (Jeffrey Tambor) enters its third season, with Maura seriously contemplating surgery. VAN HELSING (Syfy, Sept. 23) Van stands for Vanessa (Kelly Overton), a descendant of vampire hunters who carries on the family business in a world dominated by — you guessed it. BOB'S BURGERS (Fox, Sept. 25) Like the swallows to Capistrano, it's the annual return of Fox's mostly-animated Sunday comedy lineup, including this warmly anarchic favorite, in its seventh season, and Season 28 of ""The Simpsons."" SIXTY MINUTES (CBS, Sept. 25) The hoary newsmagazine begins its 49th season. One more year, and it will be in the same advertising demographic as most of its viewers. CHANNEL ZERO (Syfy, Sept. 27) An anthology series in the style of ""American Horror Story,"" this new show will base its season-long stories on the Internet-generated scary stories known as creepypasta. THE CHOICE 2016 (PBS, Sept. 27) This two-hour ""Frontline"" report from the veteran producer Michael Kirk, profiling Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump, will probably be the most serious reporting on the presidential election that you'll find on television this fall. CRISIS IN SIX SCENES (Amazon, Sept. 30) Not a lot is known about Woody Allen's first series, a six-episode, stand-alone story. According to Amazon, it's set in the 1960s and is about a suburban family and its house guest. From the trailer, we know Mr. Allen plays a novelist, but we don't know if he's the guest. MARVEL'S LUKE CAGE (Netflix, Sept. 30) Next up in the Marvel-Netflix universe: Mike Colter (""The Good Wife"") as the somewhat indestructible Luke Cage, a character first introduced last year in ""Marvel's Jessica Jones."" Rosario Dawson's Claire Temple, the nurse from ""Daredevil,"" also crosses over into the new show.  VERSAILLES (Ovation, Oct. 1) Louis XIV builds Versailles in this European-Canadian production. Constructing the palace is a political ploy on the young king's part, but its many rooms also provide gilded backdrops for plenty of sex. ASH VS. EVIL DEAD (Starz, Oct. 2) Bruce Campbell returns for a second season of comic mayhem and chainsaws. ELEMENTARY (CBS, Oct. 2) The most consistently intelligent and well-acted of the broadcast network crime dramas, with Jonny Lee Miller as Sherlock Holmes and Lucy Liu as his Watson, returns for Season 5. WESTWORLD (HBO, Oct. 2) A reboot of the 1973 sci-fi film about a very adult amusement park — where androids are a supposedly safe means for getting kicks — is HBO's latest attempt to get back on top in the prestige-drama field. But it will have to overcome the cloud of a long, troubled production and questions regarding depictions of sexual violence. TIMELESS (NBC, Oct. 3) An archcriminal (Goran Visnjic) steals a time machine to change the course of history, and not in a good way. A team is sent back to find him, providing weekly adventures and pocket history lessons. From two showrunners with a good track record, Eric Kripke (""Supernatural"") and Shawn Ryan (""The Shield""). CONVICTION (ABC, Oct. 3) Hayley Atwell (""Agent Carter"") is a wild-child former first daughter and star lawyer leading a team whose unenviable job is to ferret out wrongful convictions. The pilot breaks all speed records for putting legal-drama formulas in place, getting on with its first case within five minutes. NO TOMORROW (CW, Oct. 4) More heartfelt, gently satirical fantasy-dramedy from CW (and, like ""Jane the Virgin,"" another adaptation of a Latin-American series). A woman with a boring job at an Amazonesque retailer meets her dream guy, but there's a catch — he's expecting the world to end in less than a year. FREQUENCY (CW, Oct. 5) Of the fall's rash of remakes of old films, this one looks back the shortest distance, to the 2000 fantasy police thriller about a son talking to his dead father via enchanted ham radio. This time it's a daughter, as Peyton List (Roger Sterling's second wife, Jane, in ""Mad Men"") takes the role originally played by Jim Caviezel. DIVORCE (HBO, Oct. 9) Sarah Jessica Parker, who developed and stars in this melancholy half-hour comedy about a woman trying to start over, has been clear that it's not a follow-up to ""Sex and the City."" Helping to ensure the difference is her recruitment of the acerbic Sharon Horgan (""Catastrophe,"" ""Pulling"") to create the show and write the pilot. INSECURE (HBO, Oct. 9) Larry Wilmore, whose tenure as host of ""The Nightly Show"" abruptly ended last month, is a creator of this comedy series about two black women navigating life, love and friendship in Los Angeles. The real news, though, is the other creator (and the show's star): Issa Rae, the YouTube idol and author of ""The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl."" FREAKISH (Hulu, Oct. 10) From the teen-drama purveyors at AwesomenessTV, a small-town zombie-ish-apocalypse story: high school students emerge from a disaster drill to discover that their town's chemical plant has exploded and mutant freaks are at large. SUPERGIRL (CW, Oct. 10) Moving from CBS to CW for its second season, the show adds Lynda Carter, one-time Wonder Woman, as the president of the United States and Tyler Hoechlin (""Teen Wolf"") as Supergirl's Kryptonian cousin, Superman. VICE NEWS TONIGHT (HBO, Oct. 10) Vice Media continues its expansion into TV with this weeknight, 7:30 p.m. show that promises ""a flexible and diverse approach to reporting the nightly news,"" which means, at least, no desk and no anchors. AMERICAN HOUSEWIFE (ABC, Oct. 11) Originally titled ""The Second Fattest Housewife in Westport,"" it's ""The Middle"" moved to Connecticut and a step up the economic ladder. There's a smart, funny mom (Katy Mixon) made insecure by the town's skinny stay-at-homes; a well-meaning dad; and an eccentric youngest child. FRESH OFF THE BOAT (ABC, Oct. 11) Having weathered the public disenchantment of Eddie Huang, on whose memoir it's based, and the sometimes controversial comments about race, gender and casting of its breakout star, Constance Wu, this sitcom about a Taiwanese-American family embarks on its third season. FALLING WATER  (USA, Oct. 13) The legacy of the writer Henry Bromell (""I'll Fly Away,"" ""Homicide: Life on the Street,"" ""Homeland"") continues to grow three years after his death: he wrote (with Blake Masters) the pilot for this thriller about three people who realize they're having different parts of the same dream. GOLIATH (Amazon, Oct. 14) Quick — name the five shows David E. Kelley has had picked up since ""Boston Legal"" ended in 2008. Didn't think you could. (Only one, ""Harry's Law,"" lasted more than a season.) Now he's trying his luck online with an eight-episode drama about a trial matching an underdog lawyer (Billy Bob Thornton) and a partner from a white-shoe firm (William Hurt). The trailer has a noirish tone not typical of Mr. Kelley's TV work. HATERS BACK OFF (Netflix, Oct. 14) Colleen Ballinger's YouTube alter ego, the untalented entertainer Miranda Sings — whose views reach eight figures — moves from the two-minute video world to the half-hour series world, adding scripts and other characters. WOLF CREEK (Pop, Oct. 14) The lowest-profile of the season's movie-to-TV transfers, this adaptation of a series of Australian films is one of the more vivid and viscerally satisfying of the bunch. Lucy Fry (""Alien Surf Girls"") plays the American teenager determined to find the serial killer who murdered her family in the outback. BERLIN STATION (Epix, Oct. 16) This 10-episode spy thriller — Epix's first big bid to take on its better-known premium-cable rivals — has a promising cast. The excellent Richard Jenkins plays the C.I.A. station chief in Berlin and is joined by Michelle Forbes, Richard Armitage, Rhys Ifans and Tamlyn Tomita. EYEWITNESS (USA, Oct. 16) In the latest Nordic-noir adaptation (based on a Norwegian series), a murder investigation is followed through a 10-episode season from the perspective of two teenage witnesses. Julianne Nicholson plays a sheriff. GRAVES (Epix, Oct. 16) Nick Nolte takes on television comedy for the first time, starring in this half-hour satire as a former United States president who decides he has to atone for the mistakes he made while in office. The timing of his guilt trip is inconvenient for his wife (Sela Ward), who's running for the Senate. CHANCE (Hulu, Oct. 19) In his first headlining series role since ""House,"" Hugh Laurie plays another brilliant doctor, this time a San Francisco psychiatrist who gets embroiled in a noir-thriller scenario involving a femme-fatale patient and her husband, a detective. THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW: LET'S DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN (Fox, Oct. 20) A jump to the left, a jump to the right, a jump 41 years into the past. Fox's nostalgia binge (""Lethal Weapon,"" ""The Exorcist"") continues with this two-hour remake of the cult favorite ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show,"" starring Laverne Cox as Frank-N-Furter. (The original Frank, Tim Curry, narrates.) BLACK MIRROR (Netflix, Oct. 21) The buzz around the British writer Charlie Brooker's ""Twilight Zone""-ish anthology has been in inverse proportion to its footprint: seven episodes across three years, none seen by more than two million viewers in initial broadcasts. That should change now that Netflix has commissioned a six-episode third season. CRAZY EX-GIRLFRIEND (CW, Oct. 21) Rachel and Josh (Rachel Bloom and Vincent Rodriguez III) finally got together at the end of Season 1, but don't hold your breath — this storybook series is all about finding ways to postpone the storybook ending. DIRK GENTLY'S HOLISTIC DETECTIVE AGENCY (BBC America, Oct. 22) Max Landis, the screenwriter of ""Victor Frankenstein"" and ""American Ultra,"" created this latest adaptation of Douglas Adams's novels about a time-traveling detective (Samuel Barnett of ""The History Boys""). THE WALKING DEAD (AMC, Oct. 23) Television's highest-rated drama (in the 18-to-49 demographic) returns for Season 7. This being ""The Walking Dead,"" we're waiting to see who was being beaten with a baseball bat at the end of Season 6. MAN WITH A PLAN (CBS, Oct. 24) As ""Episodes"" approaches its final season, Matt LeBlanc returns to the broadcast-network, laugh-track sitcom fold, playing a contractor who has to take over parenting duties when his wife (Liza Snyder) gets a job. RECTIFY (SundanceTV, Oct. 26) The setting shifts from rural Georgia to Nashville in the fourth and final season of this critically esteemed series about the life of a former death-row inmate. THE GREAT INDOORS (CBS, Oct. 27) Joel McHale plays a lamestream journalist (a star writer for an outdoors magazine) adjusting to the digital future and the young podcasters and listicle-makers who embody it. It's either meta or melancholy that the show built around that premise is an entirely traditional sitcom. PURE GENIUS (CBS, Oct. 27) In the genre of ""tech billionaire teams with maverick doctor"" — hey, there was ""Proof"" — this medical drama promises weekly miracles. Starring August Prew and Dermot Mulroney, it's the first hospital-set series for the executive producer Jason Katims (""Parenthood,"" ""Friday Night Lights""). GOOD GIRLS REVOLT (Amazon, Oct. 28) James Poniewozik of The New York Times, reviewing the pilot last year, wrote that ""'Mad Women' would have done nicely"" as a title for this eight-episode series, set in 1969 and based on Lynn Povich's book about a sex-discrimination suit brought by 46 female staff members against Newsweek magazine. TRACEY ULLMAN'S SHOW (HBO, Oct. 28) A quarter-century after ""The Tracey Ullman Show"" on Fox, Ms. Ullman returns to her sketch-comedy roots in this similarly titled series, a BBC production whose staff includes several writers from HBO's ""Veep."" PEOPLE OF EARTH (TBS, Oct. 31) Sci-fi comedy is an underrepresented category, and this series from the first-time writer-producer David Jenkins has a funny trailer. Wyatt Cenac plays a journalist investigating a support group for people who have been abducted by aliens. STAN AGAINST EVIL (IFC, Oct. 31) It's sort of like ""Sleepy Hollow,"" except it's a comedy. John C. McGinley and Janet Varney play the former and current sheriffs of a New England town with a demon problem.  THE CROWN (Netflix, Nov. 4) Is it really Queen Elizabeth II if she isn't played by Helen Mirren? Claire Foy plays the 25-year-old, newly crowned queen, at least in the 10-episode first season of this biographical drama, written by Peter Morgan based on his play ""The Audience."" Matt Smith (""Doctor Who"") is a dashing young Prince Philip, and John Lithgow is the aging Winston Churchill. CLOSE TO THE ENEMY (AcornTV, Nov. 14) Cold War dramas are as plentiful these days as fake pieces of the Berlin Wall. This BBC mini-series centered on the development of the jet engine has the distinction of being written by the esteemed (in Britain) Stephen Poliakoff (""Gideon's Daughter,"" ""Perfect Strangers""). GOOD BEHAVIOR (TNT, Nov. 15) Michelle Dockery's new role is a long way from Lady Mary on ""Downton Abbey"" — or is it? She plays a con artist, just out of prison, who tries to prevent a hit man from carrying out his job. Still meddling! (The 10-episode series is based on novellas by Blake Crouch, who also wrote the ""Wayward Pines"" books.) UNDERCOVER (BBC America, Nov. 17) Peter Moffat, who wrote ""Criminal Justice,"" on which HBO's ""The Night Of"" was based, is the author of this six-part drama about a British lawyer (Sophie Okonedo) defending a death-row inmate (Dennis Haysbert). THE AFFAIR (Showtime, Nov. 20) Season 3 of this weirdly addictive soap opera/erotic thriller/murder mystery/legal drama picks up three years after Season 2's end, but it is sure to jump around in time willy-nilly. The French actress Irène Jacob joins the cast as yet another woman for Noah (Dominic West) to slobber over and will become the fifth character in the story's point-of-view rotation. SEARCH PARTY (TBS, Nov. 21) TBS goes dark and postmodern (for TBS) with this 10-episode comedy, shown on five consecutive nights, about the search for a missing woman. Alia Shawkat of ""Arrested Development"" stars. GILMORE GIRLS: A YEAR IN THE LIFE (Netflix, Nov. 25) Apparently no one ever leaves Stars Hollow: practically the entire ""Gilmore Girls"" cast (except, sadly, Edward Herrmann) returned for these four feature-length episodes, which will cover a year in the life of the fictional Connecticut town.  THE LEVEL (AcornTV, Dec. 5) From ITV, the mega-provider of British crime dramas, comes a six-part series about a detective (Karla Crome) with a secret connection to a crook (Philip Glenister). MOZART IN THE JUNGLE (Amazon, Dec. 9) The classical-music comedy that was a surprise Golden Globe winner this year returns for its third season. MAN IN THE HIGH CASTLE (Amazon, Dec. 16) In its second season, the series departs even further from the Philip K. Dick novel on which it's based, with, among many radical changes, Joe Blake (Luke Kleintank) alive and on a rocket to Berlin."
1,2016-09-16," STONY BROOK, N.Y. — As school started at Stony Brook University this month, two freshmen, Juan Adames and John Taveras, set out to buy textbooks. They had not heard yet that the bookstore was a books store no more. This summer, Stony Brook, part of the State University of New York, announced a partnership with the online retailer Amazon, now the university's official book retailer. Students can purchase texts through a Stony Brook-specific Amazon page and have them delivered to campus. In the campus store where the textbooks used to be, there are now adult coloring books, racks of university-branded polos and windbreakers and three narrow bookshelves displaying assorted novels. The rest of the store is a vibrant collage of spirit wear and school supplies: backpacks and baseball caps; pompom hats and striped scarves; notebooks and correction fluid. There will soon be a Starbucks. ""I was a bit thrown off by the appearance,"" Mr. Adames said. It is a conversation occurring on campuses across the country: If more and more students are buying and renting their course books online, why do they need a bookstore? The Queens College bookstore went digital in April, forgoing brick-and-mortar altogether, Adam L. Rockman, the vice president of student affairs, said. Students order their books online, then have them shipped to personal addresses or to campus, where they are held until students pick them up. ""There are certainly some growing pains in getting used to it for many students,"" Dr. Rockman said. ""I think the human condition is not to really love change."" The shift at Stony Brook is an attempt to provide more affordable options to students, according to Peter Baigent, the university's vice president for student affairs. Amazon is ""more of a marketplace,"" where students can comparison shop, he said, as opposed to a conventional, fixed-price store. Eventually, students will be able to order texts for delivery to an Amazon area, which is still under construction, and pick them up from storage lockers. Ripley MacDonald, director of Amazon Student Programs, said the company was also the primary course materials provider for Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., and the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Neither campus currently has a brick-and-mortar textbook store, and as at Stony Brook, the former bookstore in Amherst now sells novels and campus merchandise but not textbooks. Purdue students can still buy textbooks from stores just off campus, including one that calls itself University Bookstore. Other schools are using Amazon as a supplementary course materials provider, Mr. MacDonald said. Amazon has opened pickup locations at 12 universities since 2015, he said, and will have 17 by the end of this year. Stony Brook, like other universities working in partnership with Amazon, receives a percentage of the sales taking place on the Amazon site, said Mark Pace, the chief contracts administrator for the university's Faculty Student Association. Mr. Pace declined to say how much that amounted to, saying it was ""proprietary, confidential financial information."" According to an article by Jeffrey R. Young in The Chronicle of Higher Education, schools that team up with Amazon receive approximately two percent of sales from the web retailer. Robert D. Wynkoop, managing director of Purdue University treasurer's office, told The Chronicle that the school had made $1 million on the partnership since 2014. But partnerships with online vendors have potential downsides, Bob Walton, chief executive of the National Association of College Stores, said. Using any remote supplier means students may acquire the wrong books; students on financial aid must figure out how to order books and get reimbursement passes. The buyback system is thrown off. ""If they save five bucks and have a miserable week because they can't even get the damn thing, what good is that?"" he said. ""It's not that people can't figure these things out, it's just a hassle."" Kevin Costello, a sophomore studying biomedical engineering at Stony Brook, politely vented his ""frustration and confusion"" when he learned that employees at the former bookstore could not help when Amazon sent him the wrong course material. ""Now I'm going to have to be on the phone with customer service for a while, probably,"" said Mr. Costello, who received a disc meant for a political science class instead of his calculus course material. ""There needs to be a better system."" Eventually, students will be able to take their questions to the Amazon pickup area, where the staff will provide customer service. According to Mr. Walton, textbooks are generally not the focus of college bookstores, anyway. A school on a two-semester system has an approximately eight-week period of textbook activity per year, he estimated. ""The function of the store has been oversimplified to textbooks,"" he said. ""The store really functions on a variety of levels."" Admissions tour groups pass through; visiting alumni stop by; faculty and staff members go there for the convenience, Mr. Walton said. ""If anything's in danger, I would say the thing that's probably the danger is that textbooks are going to go away,"" he said. ""The store continues to serve a number of functions that people just don't recognize."" At Stony Brook, the former bookstore has become ""a branding piece,"" Mr. Baigent said, which helps to provide more of a ""campus university identity."" Barnes & Noble College, which operated the Stony Brook store when it sold textbooks, will continue to run it, and is also taking over the other two campus stores, neither of which sell textbooks. Barnes & Noble College Bookstores dropped ""bookstores"" from its name several years ago. ""Over the last eight years, our business has really changed dramatically,"" Patrick Maloney, the company president, said. ""To call it a bookstore any longer was very limiting."" However, 98 percent of the stores Barnes & Noble College operates still carry course materials in various formats, Mr. Maloney said. ""We firmly believe in the importance of a physical store,"" Lisa Malat, the chief marketing officer, said. ""Millennials and Gen Z are still very much committed to the physical shopping experience."" Though perhaps not only for books: In recent years, Barnes & Noble College has been offering engagement programs to bring students into its bookstores nationwide, like ""V.I.P. shopping nights,"" for students who want help in the textbook aisles or advice from peers, and ""de-stress events,"" where students can spend time coloring, or play with puppies."
0,2016-09-20," SAKAI, Japan — The stubble-haired Buddhist priest lit incense at a small, cupboardlike altar just as members of his order have done for centuries. As the priest chanted sutras, Yutaka Kai closed his eyes and prayed for his wife, who died last year of complications from a knee replacement. Mr. Kai, 68, set aside his family's devout Buddhism when he left his rural hometown decades ago to work in a tire factory. That meant Mr. Kai did not have a local temple to turn to for the first anniversary of his wife's death, a milestone for Japanese Buddhists. Cue the internet. In modern Japan, a Buddhist priest can now be found just a few mouse clicks away, on Amazon.com. ""It's affordable, and the price is clear,"" said Mr. Kai's eldest son, Shuichi, 40. ""You don't have to worry about how much you're supposed to give."" The priest at Mrs. Kai's memorial, Junku Soko, is part of a controversial business that is disrupting traditional funeral arrangements in Japan. In a country where regulations and powerful interests have stymied much of the so-called gig economy — Uber, for instance, is barely a blip here — a network of freelancing priests is making gains in the unlikely sphere of religion. Their venture is viewed by some as unseemly, and it has drawn condemnation from Buddhist leaders. An umbrella group representing Japan's many Buddhist sects complained publicly after Amazon began offering obosan-bin — priest delivery — on its Japanese site last year, in partnership with a local start-up. But the priests and their backers say they are addressing real needs. They assert that obosan-bin is helping to preserve Buddhist traditions by making them accessible to the millions of people in Japan who have become estranged from the religion. ""Temples will sell you 10 yen candles for 100 yen,"" said Mr. Soko, 39. ""They're protecting their own interests."" Such arguments will be familiar to anyone who has watched e-commerce companies upend other parts of the economy, from book publishing to airlines, taxis and hotels. In Japan, even in areas far less sensitive than religion, newcomers often receive a chilly reception, and start-ups are rarer than in other rich countries. Among the explanations are a scarcity of venture capital, the political clout wielded by established businesses and a culture that values stability over the creative destruction that drives growth in countries like the United States. Yet religion may prove to be an exception. It is so opaque — and so removed from the day-to-day lives of many modern Japanese — that a little technological disruption may prove welcome. The stakes are material as well as spiritual. As with religious institutions in many other countries, temples in Japan receive generous tax breaks. ""If it becomes a fee for services instead of a donation, and the government says, 'O.K., we're going to tax you like a regular business,' how are we supposed to object?"" said Hanyu Kakubo, a priest at the Japan Buddhist Federation, which opposes obosan-bin. As with adherents of many religions, Buddhists typically give donations to priests for their services. Proponents of obosan-bin argue that conventional temples already operate like businesses — ones that put customers at a disadvantage though murky pricing. The amount is left up to the donor, a custom that leads many to overpay, Mr. Soko said. ""They don't want to make things clear,"" he said. Much of the reaction in Japan to obosan-bin has been positive, for equally familiar reasons: It offers convenience and low, predictable prices. ""There has been fierce criticism from the Buddhist world, but these days many people are abandoning religious funerals altogether,"" said Noriyuki Ueda, an anthropologist who studies Buddhism at Tokyo Institute of Technology. ""At least people using obosan-bin think having a priest is necessary."" Mr. Kakubo of the Buddhist federation conceded that many temples had done a poor job of adapting. ""We need to reflect on the fact that we've created this situation where people feel that they have to turn to the internet,"" he said, adding: ""Are we protecting our vested interests? Yes, obviously."" The process of booking a priest on Amazon can feel disconcertingly secular. Users click on one of several options and add it to a virtual shopping cart, the same way they would a juicer or a pair of shoes. Prices are fixed. A basic memorial ceremony at the home of the deceased costs ¥35,000, or about $344. The most expensive package, with a second service at a cemetery and the granting of a special posthumous Buddhist name, costs ¥65,000. Obosan-bin was originally the brainchild of Minrevi, a for-profit internet start-up. Before signing on with Amazon last year, it built a network of 400 priests and took bookings on its own website, which it still maintains, as well as by phone. It said it keeps about 30 percent of the fees it collects; the rest goes to the priest. The company has added another 100 priests to meet demand generated by its new partnership with Amazon, said Jumpei Masano, a spokesman. It expects bookings to increase by 20 percent this year, to around 12,000. ""A lot of people don't have any connection with a temple, so they don't know where to turn or what to do when they have to arrange a funeral,"" Mr. Masano said. ""We saw there was a need."" Amazon declined to comment. In a written reply to the Buddhist association in April, reported by Japanese news media, it said its goal was ""to provide as much information as possible"" to its users so they ""can make their own decisions."" When Mr. Kai's wife, Chieko, died, her funeral was held at a secular funeral parlor. But for the anniversary, Mr. Kai decided he wanted a priest. ""We had a big altar in the house where I grew up, but not here,"" he said, gesturing around his small, tidy apartment in a public housing complex. He said he rarely thought about religion until his wife's death. In the years after World War II, rural dwellers like Mr. Kai poured into places like Sakai, an industrial suburb of Osaka. Relatively few bothered to put down new religious roots in the city. Today, 70 percent of Japanese identify themselves in surveys as nonreligious or atheist, though many said they still followed traditional religious customs such as going to a Shinto shrine at New Year or periodically visiting their ancestors' graves. Mr. Kai's daughter-in-law found Minrevi's website. Her only request was that the priest should belong to the order to which the Kai family had belonged in his hometown, in Ehime Prefecture on the island of Shikoku. Mr. Soko fit the bill. At the ceremony, which took place in Mr. Kai's apartment, Mr. Soko delivered a short homily about faith and remembering the dead. The Kais seemed satisfied: They said they would request Mr. Soko for the next important death anniversary, in two years' time. Mr. Soko said innovations like obosan-bin are vital to Buddhism's survival. Most temples' dues-paying congregations are shrinking as a result of social change and rural depopulation. Incomes are shrinking, too. Revenue at temples and other religious institutions has fallen by a third in the last 20 years, mostly because of a drop in regular donations from long-term members, according to the government's Agency for Cultural Affairs. ""In the seminary, they teach you to chant sutras, but they don't tell you anything about how to manage a temple,"" Mr. Soko said. ""We have to try new things."""
0,2016-09-21," I assumed the humiliations had ended. They began even before my book was published, when network morning shows that regularly had me on now refused my pleas for some airtime to promote it. Once the book came out in 2012, it only got worse. I read at bookstores with audiences smaller than those you might find randomly browsing on any given day, and had an Amazon ranking higher than the number of books I thought existed in the world. Less than a year after publication, my publisher, Hachette, told me they were mulching the tens of thousands of remaining copies of my book, ""Man Made: A Stupid Quest for Masculinity,"" and suggested I purchase copies while they still existed. I capitulated, sending a check to the very people who once paid me to write it. Through a haze of self-pity I was utterly incapable of envisioning the physical reality of 300 hardcover books. So a few days later, I was blockaded from entering my house, at risk of succumbing to a literary shame avalanche. I have since lugged these 300 books to a new house, and then again when we built a new storage area, feeling like Sisyphus punished for lacking a strong enough story arc. Perhaps the worst indignity is that Hachette sends me a statement each quarter listing my sales and charting my progress toward paying back my advance. Which is pointless unless Hachette pays royalties to authors' great-great-great-great-great-grandchildren. And they each also buy 300 books. But after three years of suffering through my stupid quest to sell a book, I encountered an ignominy I didn't even know existed. My 6-year-old son's friend Livia came over for a play date, and her mom brought a copy of my book for me to sign. I took out the thick black Sharpie that makes me feel very important, flipped to the cover page ready to write something falsely self-­deprecating and saw, stamped in big letters: ""Property of the Calgary Public Library."" Did this nice public-school teacher steal a book on a ski trip? Did she love my book so much that she decided never to return it — paying fines in perpetuity until she becomes the main benefactor of Alberta's library system? No, Livia's mom had bought it on Amazon. I figured there must be some black market in books from Canada, akin to the way prescription medicine is brought over the border. That very same week, I went to a meeting where someone pulled out a copy of my book for me to sign. This one was stamped ""St. Helena Library"" in black, and then right on top of that, in red, ""Discard."" I instantly understood what had happened. Not only would no one buy my book, but libraries in various countries were disposing of them because people wouldn't take them for free. My book was so bad even Canadians were being mean to it. I emailed the Calgary Public Library to ask why they had given up hope for my book, and why it had taken them a few years longer than it took me to do so. The nice Canadian person there told me the library system had bought six copies of my book for their 18 branches, which seemed generous since there's not a lot of time to read about struggling with your masculinity while you're drinking Molsons and watching old hockey fights on an oil rig in minus-10-degree snowstorms. Calgary jettisoned two copies after discovering that one had been checked out 10 times and the other only five. Which means 15 more people read my book than I had thought. Apparently, though, that's not good enough for the Calgary library system, which had to make room for collections of staff picks. This included a group of works compiled under the rubric ""So Long, Movember, Hello Novem-burns,"" all of which celebrated sideburns. I told my sad story to Susan Orlean, who, despite being a New York Times best-­selling author, told me she too has endured library dumping. ""I have been at signings where a person sheepishly presents a book for me and I think, 'Interesting. They have the Mylar sleeve. How anal.' And I open the front cover and see 'Barnstable Library,' "" she said. ""You've been rejected by the one institution that is practically required by law to carry your book. You've been remaindered by the citizens of America."" Orlean, to my surprise, told me that she's working on a project she calls ""The Library Book,"" which is about the 1986 arson fire at the Los Angeles Central Library, and has learned a lot about these institutions' mysterious ways. She tried to make me feel better by saying that she sees carts of books being culled each day from the Central Library to make room for new acquisitions. Just like bookstores, libraries buy a bunch of copies when a book first comes out, and get rid of them once demand drops. When she offered the Central Library a free copy of her 2011 book ""Rin Tin Tin,"" they politely declined. But just as she found tricks to avoid other author humiliations (namely, selling a lot of books), she's gotten herself out of this one too. For no matter how few people are checking it out, no librarian is going to toss ""The Library Book."" ""This is my secret plan. The people who make these decisions about whether to euthanize a book are the people whom the book will be about,"" Orlean said. Which is why I'm calling my own next book ""Remainder at Your Own Risk: Voodoo Spells That Prevent Massive Local Government Cutbacks."""
0,2016-09-25," SAN FRANCISCO — Paying for things online can be cumbersome. Even the man who invented the web, Tim Berners-Lee, says he frequently throws up his hands. ""Sometimes I will think that I bought something and I press the button, 'Buy this,' and I don't realize it didn't go through,"" Mr. Berners-Lee said in a recent interview. ""We are long overdue for a payments user interface for the web."" Responding to the frustrations of Mr. Berners-Lee and hundreds of millions of online shoppers, the web's governing body, the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, has brought together the giants of the internet including Google, Facebook and Apple to fix the clumsiness of paying for things online. Now, a new global standard for online payments — a sort of Amazon one-click payment system for the entire internet — is being completed by the consortium and its members. Google, one of the authors of the standard, has recently introduced it in certain new versions of its Chrome browser. Other browser companies have said they intend to follow. The standard will provide a uniform way for users to input their credit cards and payment systems to any web browser so that they can be used for any purchase on the web. After the card details are entered once, they will automatically be called up as choices for all future transactions. This will be somewhat like the existing auto-fill functions that browsers have. But with the new standard, all the data fields will be filled in invisibly, requiring just one click. On the security side, rather than sending along all the credit card details, the browser will generate a one-time payment token that will avoid leaving your credit card number in countless databases around the world. Numerous efforts to modernize the payment system have failed to take off. And this one could fizzle, too, if online merchants, web browsers or consumers fail to adopt the new standard. The new standard will also face competition from the Amazons and PayPals of the world, as well as from the credit card networks, all of which want to be the primary destination for payments, rather than just one option. But payment analysts are hopeful about the new effort because it will not require consumers or merchants to use a new method of payment. Instead it will be equally open to any existing card or payment app, and it will channel them into a single place that most consumers already use — the web browser — where everything can be stored and used. ""Instead of simplifying the world, we have been fragmenting it into a million apps,"" said Eric Shea, a payments consultant at Kurt Salmon Digital. ""If we can get back to that single integrated solution that everyone has on their phone and their desktop, that is the way to move forward and get adoption."" Dave Birch, a consultant who has been working on electronic payments for over two decades, said the web browser stood the best chance of providing a unified and more secure portal for payments. ""There's a convergence going on,"" said Mr. Birch, who currently works for Consult Hyperion. ""In the future you will have one experience — it won't matter if you are at the store or on the phone. It will pop up on your phone, you will put your thumb on it and you will be done."" The W3C project represents a challenge to PayPal and Amazon, the current giants of online payments. Both have gained business and fees with their more streamlined checkout processes. Neither company has participated in the current W3C effort and they are likely to continue to provide an alternative to customers who don't want to enter their details into their browsers. But the W3C has managed to bring in about 40 of the biggest players in online commerce, including Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and American Express as well as Chinese companies like Alibaba and Tencent. All met last week in Portugal to put the finishing touches on the specifications that they will introduce on different time frames to users around the world. In the version that Google released, when customers shopping at participating merchants hit the buy button, they are given a drop-down menu of their stored shipping addresses and credit cards. The customer can click on the address and card to be used, enter the three-digit security code on the card and hit ""pay now."" Other browser companies may choose to use a fingerprint instead of the security code. ""We wanted to remove what we jokingly call the Nascar effect of checkout, where you see five or seven logos for the different cards and payment methods you can use,"" said Zach Koch, the top Google executive on the project. ""This is really fast, where a user can say, 'Tap, tap, buy.'"" The fees from transactions will still go to existing financial institutions like credit card companies and banks, unless customers choose a new online payment method like Apple Pay or Samsung Pay. Apple Pay takes a piece of each transaction; Samsung Pay does not. But the bigger goal behind the W3C project is to create a standard, seamless and secure way to pay for things electronically in a future that will most likely include virtual reality stores, chat-based transactions and machines making payments to other machines (an autonomous car paying for a parking spot, for instance). The standard will also make it easy to include new payment methods like Bitcoin or the Chinese payment provider Tencent. ""This involves quite radical changes to the way people think about payments,"" said Ian Jacobs, the W3C staff member leading the effort. ""As a standards body it is our job to be sure it is an open playing field."" The need to create a better way to pay for things online was evident from the web's beginnings in the 1990s, Mr. Berners-Lee said. At some of the earliest meetings of the W3C, which he founded, there were discussions about creating a way to pay for things online that didn't require people to send credit card details over the internet. The failure to come up with a standard and secure way to do this led to the hodgepodge of payment screens consumers encounter today. It also made an opening for PayPal, which created a way for shoppers to pay on different sites using a single password. Mr. Birch said the main hurdle to accomplishing more seamless payments in the past was online merchants, who did not want to give up control over any part of the checkout process. But merchants have expressed increasing frustration with the high rate of abandoned online transactions and the frequency of credit card fraud. More than half of online purchases now happen on mobile phones, but Shopify has said that only 40 percent of the customers who start filling a shopping cart online finish their transactions. Shopify, which manages the online stores and checkout processes for 300,000 merchants, has been closely involved with the W3C effort and is planning to immediately offer the new standard to its merchants, as is Groupon. ""We are betting a lot on it,"" said Jason Normore, the director of engineering at Shopify. ""Even though it cuts out a piece of our offering, it makes commerce better for everyone."" Apple will be one of the most interesting players to watch, given that it has both the Safari browser, which is part of the W3C effort, and Apple Pay, which could be seen as a competing offering. In the new operating system that Apple released last week, it is possible, for the first time, to shop online using the Safari browser and check out with Apple Pay. After hitting ""Pay With Apple Pay,"" the customer is asked to provide a fingerprint on a phone, and the transaction is complete. The W3C standard will provide a similar experience on any browser — on a computer or phone — but will also allow customers to choose from any credit card or payment method they have entered into their browsers. Apple has so far been a part of the W3C group writing the standards, which will allow it to integrate non-Apple Pay choices into its browser. Mr. Berners-Lee said he hoped that more standardized payments would open up new types of online commerce that aren't possible now. He has long been interested in micropayments that would allow newspapers or small producers of content to be paid a few cents at a time, which isn't possible in a world with only credit cards. ""Different things call for different payments,"" he said. ""If they are all interoperable you can separate the market for goods being sold from the payment back end."""
0,2016-09-28," Five major technology companies said Wednesday that they had created an organization to set the ground rules for protecting humans — and their jobs — in the face of rapid advances in artificial intelligence. The Partnership on AI, unites Amazon, Facebook, Google, IBM and Microsoft in an effort to ease public fears of machines that are learning to think for themselves and perhaps ease corporate anxiety over the prospect of government regulation of this new technology. The organization has been created at a time of significant public debate about artificial intelligence technologies that are built into a variety of robots and other intelligent systems, including self-driving cars and workplace automation. The industry group introduced a set of basic ethical standards for engineering development and scientific research that its five members have agreed upon. In a conference call on Wednesday, five artificial intelligence researchers representing the companies said they thought the technology would be a major force in the world for social and economic benefits, but they acknowledged the potential for misuse in a wide variety of ways. They said their effort was not intended to be an enforcement organization to force technology companies into self-regulation. Rather, they want to foster ""public understanding"" and set ""best practices"" for work in artificial intelligence. ""We passionately believe in the potential for it to transform in a positive way our world,"" said Mustafa Suleyman, head of applied A.I. for DeepMind, an artificial intelligence development company acquired by Google in 2014. ""We believe it's critical now to start to think about new models of engagement with the public, new models of collaboration across the industry and new models of transparency around the work that we do."" The group released eight tenets that are evocative of Isaac Asimov's original ""Three Laws of Robotics,"" which appeared in a science fiction story in 1942. The new principles include high-level ideals such as, ""We will seek to ensure that A.I. technologies benefit and empower as many people as possible."" Nevertheless, at least one of the tenets implies that the companies realize they could be drawn into sticky ethical situations, and it calls on engineers to oppose the use of artificial intelligence technology in weapons or other tools that could be used to violate human rights. ""With the hyperbole about A.I. over the last two to four years, there have been concerns in an echo chamber of anxiety that the government itself will be misinformed,"" said Eric Horvitz, managing director for Microsoft Research. The researchers said they were talking with other companies like Apple and research laboratories like the new nonprofit research group OpenAI about participating in their organization."
1,2016-09-28," PARIS — For Dior, it is a revolution: a woman leading its creative side for the first time in the house's 69-year history. On Friday, Maria Grazia Chiuri will unveil her first collection for the house to an audience (and clients) on the edge of their seats with anticipation. So it is fortuitous that this turning point coincides with the release of a glossy, eight-part television drama calculated to remind us how it all began. ""The Collection,"" Amazon Prime's first original British series, which debuted in Britain this month and will be aired in France starting in November, tells the story of two brothers — one a businessman, the other a designer — and their mission to build a great couture house that would reinstate Paris as the center of the fashion world after the end of the Nazi occupation. The series is gorgeously shot, contrasting the gritty, wounded reality of postwar Paris with the bright lights, opulence and excess of the world of haute couture. Alas, the accents of its mostly British cast tend to undermine the feeling of authenticity — a problem alleviated by the addition of Mamie Gummer, Meryl Streep's daughter, as an American heiress, and the French actress Jenna Thiam as the working-class daughter of Sabine's chief seamstress who unexpectedly becomes the face of the fashion house. On one level, the story line is a tangled mass of mystery; a slow, painful revelation of the secrets its characters hold tight: collaboration with the Nazis, moral recriminations, forbidden love, even murder. On another, however, ""The Collection"" works as a thinly fictionalized version of the Dior success story, and a reminder of what it was like when men were running the show. The series's creators say they drew inspiration for the House of Sabine, as the fictional fashion house is named, from a number of Paris designers, including Balenciaga, Fath and Lelong. But the parallels between the Sabine brothers' ""new look"" collection in 1947 and Christian Dior's collection that same year — an event that transformed couture and ushered in the New Look that still resonates today — are unmistakable. Gone was the hard, boxy and masculine look (including liberating trousers) that came with wartime fabric rationing. ""Hideous and repellent"" is how Dior described that look. Instead he made sculpted dresses of as much as 25 yards of the finest luxury fabrics: ultrafeminine, but a burden to wear. Corsets shrank waists by up to two inches; crinolines and padding made full, calf-length skirts even more voluminous. Busts were lifted and breasts made into pointed cones. High heels and wide-brimmed or tilted tri-cornered hats completed the look. Comfort was not the point: not then, and not now, on the small screen. The costume designers Chattoune & Fab acknowledge the retrograde feel of the 30 dresses they created by hand for the female stars of ""The Collection."" (They also pieced together 1,200 outfits for the rest of the cast.) ""Women had been liberated during the war with jackets and trousers, and suddenly, Ooh! Fashion comes, and it's, 'Let's go back to corsets and be uncomfortable,' "" said Chattoune, whose name is Françoise Bourrec. ""When people came to the studio and picked up the dresses, they were stunned to feel how unbelievably heavy they were. They were really very painful for the models to wear."" Even after the war, with rationing still in place, not everyone celebrated the return to luxurious decadence. In one scene in the series, a young model wearing an opulent Sabine dress is mobbed by a group of poor women selling fruits and vegetables. It is reminiscent of an actual event in the fall of 1948 on the Rue Lepic in Montmartre, when two older women, enraged at what they saw as irresponsible ostentation and waste, tore at a Dior dress worn by a young woman. ""As an American, you seldom get to see this dark, seamy side of Paris after the war,"" said Oliver Goldstick, the creator, writer and executive producer of ""The Collection."" ""It was very, very cold. There was no fuel. The cafes were empty. This was not Gene Kelly dancing on the banks of the Seine."" Big money played an important role. The House of Sabine is bankrolled by a French cotton magnate, just as Dior opened his own couture house with funding from Marcel Boussac, a war profiteer and the country's cotton king, at the time the richest man in France. Even the series's overheated dialogue about the high stakes facing the House of Sabine — ""Nothing bold or magnificent is built from fear""; ""Just remind people that Paris is where it begins and ends!"" — could have been uttered by Dior himself, who once announced, ""In an epoch as somber as ours, luxury must be defended inch by inch."" Still, the designer's unapologetic approach to marketing French fashion — and courting the American market — made him a national treasure; two years after he started, Dior's couture exports accounted for 5 percent of France's total export revenue. So back to Ms. Chiuri. Today, the Dior website proclaims that the New Look is a ""perpetual revolution."" Indeed, Raf Simons, Ms. Chiuri's predecessor, regularly revived, shrunk, curved and cut away the classic Dior Bar jacket presented in the spring 1947 collection. Which raises the question: Will the series spawn yet more nostalgia for that gorgeous, if cumbersome, era in women's dress? Or will Ms. Chiuri sweep away the memories and make something new of her own? On Friday, we find out."
0,2016-09-29," We're in the midst of a revolution in American television comedy, and one important source for the dark humor and cinematic style of shows like ""Louie"" and ""Transparent"" is undoubtedly the films of Woody Allen. It's especially disappointing, then, that ""Crisis in Six Scenes,"" Mr. Allen's first TV show, feels instantly forgettable. In recent years, Mr. Allen's movies have swung wildly in quality, alternating real highs (""Midnight in Paris,"" ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"") with definite lows (""Hollywood Ending,"" ""Irrational Man""). ""Crisis,"" a six-episode mini-series available on Friday from Amazon, sits in between. It's closer to the low end, but for fans of a certain earlier strain of his work, its shambling, amiable vibe may seem comfortingly familiar. But ""Crisis"" also seems inconsequential, as if Mr. Allen, faced with filling not quite three hours of screen time, emptied his notebook and strung together a series of comic set pieces that don't quite add up to a story. A few of the scenes are funny in themselves — one in particular, a self-referential bit featuring Mr. Allen's character pitching a TV series to a pair of stone-faced young executives, is close to vintage. Most of them, however, have a ghostlike semblance of humor. You can see where the laughs are supposed to be, because you've seen Mr. Allen do this kind of thing before. But here he's just going through the motions. ""Crisis"" appears to be set in the late 1960s, around the time Mr. Allen, already a veteran comedy writer for TV and film, was embarking on his career as a director. He plays Sidney J. Munsinger, a longtime advertising copywriter and sometime novelist who, late in life, has decided he wants to break into TV. The crisis of the title occurs when his comfortable suburban existence is disrupted by the arrival of Lennie (Miley Cyrus), a young, fugitive radical (she bombed a draft board) who's connected to his wife, Kay, and needs a place to hide out. There are plot complications involving Lennie's plans to flee to Cuba, which require Sid and Kay (Elaine May) to go into New York and conduct some slapstick skulduggery reminiscent of ""Manhattan Murder Mystery."" But the setup is primarily an excuse for Mr. Allen to do the befuddled-exasperation shtick he perfected a half-century ago (and is still pretty good at). Sid waves his arms and insists that Lennie leave; Lennie ignores him, eats all the food in the house and quickly radicalizes Kay, who's drawn to her youthful energy, and Alan (John Magaro), a young family friend who's drawn to her more physical attributes. The story resolves itself in one of those circuslike endings where waves of people — relatives, Kay's marriage-counseling clients, a book club, a pair of gun-toting anarchists — show up at Sid and Kay's house all loudly demanding attention. It's supposed to be zany fun, but as with most of the rest of ""Crisis,"" Mr. Allen's halfhearted direction doesn't get it there. The pleasures the show offers are mostly in performance — Ms. May and Mr. Magaro give their characters some life, and Mr. Allen, of course, has his own rhythms down pat. He also gives himself the best lines, as when Sid, describing his first novel, says: ""It was called 'Let There Be Light.' It was about a proctologist who finds God in the strangest places."" Throughout the show, the notion of TV as a lesser endeavor pops up. When the crisis has passed, Sid says, ""Maybe I should dump this whole idiotic television series thing and give one last shot to writing the book."" Presumably Mr. Allen is just making fun of Sid's pretensions. But watching ""Crisis,"" you can't help wishing that rather than making his first show at the age of 80, he'd just avoided the whole television series thing."
0,2016-09-30," See that scruffy-looking guy up there on the stage, the one messing around with the microphones and the plastic water bottles? It turns out that he's a world-class head shrinker — and head enlarger, too, an all-purpose mind-bender. He is going to retune, rearrange and reproportion your senses, while taking you places you never expected to visit. All you have to do is lend him your ears. Surely, no production on Broadway has ever thrown the doors of perception open as widely as ""The Encounter,"" Simon McBurney's astonishing one-man show, which opened on Thursday night at the Golden Theater. On one level, this singular piece from Complicite, a long-lived London-based troupe that regularly ventures where no actor has gone before, is simply a classic adventure story of an intrepid Western explorer lost in the Amazon rain forest. But the plot, as exotic as it might seem, is only the point of departure for a more far-reaching journey. That's the one in which Mr. McBurney takes what he calls a ""walk across your brain."" It's a perambulation that disassembles everything he's saying to you and how he's saying it, how you're processing it and even how you'll be thinking about it tomorrow. Your passport is the set of earphones that you'll find attached to your seat. Sounds hokey, doesn't it, like 3-D glasses or one of those gimmicks that the moviemaker William Castle touted in the 1950s, using names like Percepto and Illusion-O. The earphones you've been issued don't even look particularly sophisticated. But almost as soon as you put them on, your sense of time and space is altered. Mr. McBurney suddenly seems to be standing right next to you, whispering and (oh, wow!) blowing into your ear. Then he's over there, behind you, and there, in front of you, and then practically sitting in your lap. Yet your eyes tell you that he's never left the stage. Maybe you shouldn't trust your eyes. The question of where voices come from, and how we hear them, turns out to be central to the plot of ""The Encounter."" The play is inspired by Petru Popescu's ""Amazon Beaming,"" a 1991 novel based on the American photojournalist Loren McIntyre's accounts of his time spent among the mystical Mayoruna tribe in the Amazon in 1969. To recreate these adventures, Mr. McBurney becomes McIntyre, a third-person narrator, assorted tribesmen, the occasional jungle animal or insect and — always — Mr. McBurney himself, the man behind the curtain, pulling the levers and juggling the plot. Except in this case, Mr. McBurney is always in full view, standing amid the foam-walled simulated sound studio designed by Michael Levine. You watch him turning from one microphone to another, and crumpling a plastic bag or shaking one of those water bottles to simulate the noises of the brush or the river. So in theory, you can always accurately trace direct cause and effect within the show's illusions. No, you can't. Mr. McBurney and his ace sound designers, Gareth Fry and Pete Malkin, have created an aural labyrinth of many layers. You'll be watching Mr. McBurney's lips moving in sync with what you're hearing, only to discover that it's just a recorded voice you've been listening to. Did I say ""just a recorded voice""? It's a mistake to give undue value to what's ""real"" over what's a simulacrum of reality. With your earphones on, there's no distinguishing between the live and the prerecorded, a blurring that allows Mr. McBurney to conduct very immediate-feeling conversations with his past selves. And with his 5-year-old daughter, whose voice keeps interrupting him in what feels like real time. And with a host of people he interviewed in preparation for this show, including Mr. Popescu and a variety of neuroscientists, philosophers and environmentalists, who keep interrupting the central story with fragments of theories you've heard them expound earlier in the show. The subject of what they have to say is profound enough to feel embarrassing. Among the questions posed: Is consciousness possible without memory? Is time only a structuring fiction devised by humans? Does time have one or two dimensions? Can language exist without words? Does the introduction of modern materialist cultures into indigenous communities inevitably destroy their essence? Don't worry if you didn't sign up for a lecture. The academics are never allowed to hold forth for long. Instead, their voices poke into our consciousness in shards, like flotsam and jetsam carried by a rushing stream. This melding of partly articulated ideas suggests that twilight that occurs just before you fall asleep, when the accumulated impressions of a day — and a lifetime — swirl in and out of focus, each weighted with the same significance. And there are moments that approximate the jolting, abrupt waking from such a state of mind. You can be river-deep and mountain-high in the forest with a bewildered and depleted McIntyre after he's been stripped of all his modern-man appurtenances, when the sound of a door opening thrusts us into Mr. McBurney's London home, in the room where he is working on this show and where his restless little girl has entered yet again with a bedtime request. So are these domestic scenes the present tense of the show? No, that would be the show itself, right? Better not to think too hard about this while you're watching it. Not that your mind (or whatever you choose to call it) is ever likely to drift. Mr. McBurney, who does McIntyre's voice as that of a strapping stoic from a cowboy film, sustains the momentum of his story as tensely and enjoyably as if it were a Rudyard Kipling yarn, albeit of a postcolonial ilk. This isn't a voyage into a heart of darkness but of enlightenment. And yes, there's an attendant glimmer of New Age spiritualism. But the awe-struck descriptions of nature in ascendance are always secondary to what we're feeling, physically as well as emotionally. And ""The Encounter,"" which has only sharpened its production values since I saw it in London in February, summons those sensations not just through sound but also through lighting (by Paul Anderson) and projections (by Will Duke) that transform a sterile stage into a phosphorescent jungle where shadow trumps substance or an American suburb illuminated by a bonfire of discarded worldly goods. For ""The Encounter"" is definitely a work of theater. And though you first meet Mr. McBurney as a vaguely detached magician M.C., his performance becomes increasingly passionate and physical. He is wrestling with all the elements that go into telling and listening to a story, which includes those transporting moments when the teller becomes the tale. As does the audience. Just before you put on your earphones, Mr. McBurney says, by way of partial explanation, that ""empathy and proximity are connected."" It may be he who's running and dancing and leaping and sweating. But by the end of this nonpareil show's two intermissionless hours, you are as lightheaded, exhausted, baffled and invigorated as if it had been you."
1,2016-09-30," SEATTLE — Amazon paid about $1 billion two years ago to acquire Twitch, the streaming video service with a fanatical following among gamers. Now the company is using Twitch to start a deeper push into the video game business. On Thursday, Amazon presented three new games it is developing, including a fantasy brawling game called Breakaway, that weave features from Twitch more deeply into the gaming experience. Amazon has released a handful of casual games in the past, but these are its first PC games aimed at hard-core players. Amazon is appearing more sure-footed in the entertainment business. It is financing dozens of original television shows and movies, including Emmy winners like ""Transparent,"" which are available to subscribers through its Prime membership service. The company is wagering it can differentiate itself from the sea of games available online, partly by using Twitch in novel ways. Twitch is most commonly used by players to stream their game-playing sessions live over the internet. The service is also known for its raucous chat rooms that accompany live streams, allowing spectators to comment on the action on a video stream. ""The Twitch community has already changed how games are experienced,"" Michael Frazzini, vice president of games at Amazon, said in a phone interview. ""What we think is next is to change how games are made."" In Amazon's new games, for example, there will be a capability called Matchbuilder that allows someone broadcasting a game-playing session on Twitch to pluck people directly from a chat room and allow them to play the next round of the game. Mr. Frazzini compared it to allowing spectators to play basketball with Michael Jordan after watching him take warm-up shots. Another capability will allow broadcasters to pull statistics about player performances out of Amazon's games and display them for Twitch viewers. But none of it will matter if the games are duds with players. Amazon showed Breakaway for the first time on Thursday to an audience at TwitchCon in San Diego, a convention for Twitch fans and broadcasters. The game pits two teams of four players as warriors and sorceresses. The other new offerings are New World, a multiplayer online game set in a desolate, hostile land, and Crucible, a survival game on an alien planet. Here is a Twitch broadcast from Thursday showing Breakaway: On Friday, Amazon also announced a set of gaming-related benefits called Twitch Prime for Amazon Prime subscribers. Twitch Prime includes free games and in-game items. For example, members will get a free character, Tyrande Whisperwind, for the popular digital card game Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, said Emmett Shear, chief executive of Twitch. Anyone with an existing subscription to Prime, which costs $99 a year for an annual membership, can get the Twitch benefits by linking their Prime and Twitch accounts. ""It's the first really deep integration between Amazon and Twitch,"" Mr. Shear said."
0,2016-10-01," WORSTED LODGE, England — After hours of searching, I pulled onto a dirt track here in the rolling hills of Cambridgeshire and spotted a small dot whirring across the blue sky, gently swaying in the breeze as it steadily flew about 200 feet above the ground. Jackpot: It was an Amazon drone. Barely visible to the naked eye, the unmarked aircraft, about the size of a large model plane, floated across a field about 1,000 yards in the distance, the lights on its four-pronged sensors flashing brightly against the afternoon sun. Amazon, the giant e-commerce company, began secretly testing unmanned aircraft this summer at an undisclosed location in Britain (its largest outdoor test site, according to an Amazon executive). I set out to find the top secret site, wanting to see how we all may one day receive online deliveries. In retrospect, signs of Amazon's secret tests were hidden in plain sight. There was the warning to pilots that unmanned aircraft would be flying in the area, about an hour north of London, until early October; the uncharacteristically fast cellphone reception in such a remote area — a must when processing drone data; and the growing list of jobs and openings at Amazon's research and development site in Cambridge related to Prime Air, the company's ambitious plan to use drones for everyday deliveries. Amazon is not alone, however, as other companies conduct drone trials around the world. In New Zealand, Domino's Pizza is testing drones to ferry fast food across the country. Google is offering burrito orders delivered by drone in Virginia. JD.com, the Chinese e-commerce giant, already has a fleet of drones flying autonomously for a maximum of 15 miles round-trip, to reach rural communities at a fifth of the cost of traditional trucks (though a person still takes the package on the last leg of its journey to the recipient). In Britain, Amazon is working with local authorities to test several aspects of drone technology like piloting the machines beyond the line of sight of operators, a practice still outlawed in the United States. Regulators here first authorized the commercial use of drones in 2010 — years before the Federal Aviation Authority eased its restrictions on remotely piloted aircraft in June. Amazon settled on Britain after the United States initially denied it approval for such tests. At the site in the Cambridge countryside, and a similar facility in Canada, Amazon is likely to be working on the drone's sensors and other improvements needed for its daily use. A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the English test site. With competitors aplenty, it is not surprising that Amazon wants to hide efforts from prying eyes. In Fulbourn, the nearest village to the test site, where thatch-roofed houses and a centuries-old church stand guard over the quiet main street, few people even knew that the American technology giant had moved in down the road. ""Drones? Here?"" said Linda McCarthy, who was taking her two Labrador retrievers for their morning walk as I trudged by on a public footpath with a map of the area and a pair of decades-old binoculars. ""I've never heard anything about that."" Some people in this rural area have had angry reactions. To Julia Napier, a co-founder of Friends of the Roman Road and Fleam Dyke, a local association that maintains public footpaths around the site, Amazon's arrival is a potential threat to local wildlife and the wider countryside, something the company has denied. Over coffee and surrounded by wildlife maps of the area, Ms. Napier, 78, complained that Amazon had not consulted many local residents about its tests. She questioned what right the company had to fly across the British countryside, possibly without the permission of landowners, even though such authorization may not be required. Ms. Napier refuses to use Amazon's services, preferring to visit her local bookshop or smaller online British rivals. Her stance against the e-commerce giant has not gone unnoticed. A company employee called last week, Ms. Napier said, trying to persuade her that the local drone trials were safe and did not pose a risk to wildlife. She remains skeptical. ""They are testing those drones here because they can't do it in America,"" she said. ""Whatever the Americans don't want, I don't want it, either."" Rumors about mysterious aircraft flying low across the countryside drew me to the area. Yet pulling up in a nearby parking lot on an unseasonably warm September morning, I felt as if I was in the wrong place. Nothing looked out of the ordinary. Commuters arrived at a rural office park and dog walkers basked in the late-summer sun. And as I walked miles (I ended up covering the distance of a half-marathon) along a Roman road built roughly 2,000 years ago — now a grassy public footpath — I was no closer to finding the elusive machines. My ears pricked up to every noise that broke the rural tranquillity, only to be disappointed when the buzzing turned out to be a tractor, car or just a swarm of bees flying in the midday sun. Returning to my car after exhausting almost all the public footpaths, I had a sinking suspicion I was on a wild-goose chase. Only one route remained. Less than 300 yards down the grassy track on the edge of a farm, a security guard with a walkie-talkie popped up from behind a hedgerow and pointed to a sign declaring: ""Private property. No trespassing."" When he repeatedly told me this was indeed private property and that he had called the farmer to evict me, I knew I was onto something. As I circled the property with Andrew Testa, a photographer for The New York Times, my suspicions only grew. At the entrance to the farm — despite Amazon's presence, farm work was still underway — a security guard in a fluorescent vest was checking the identifications of people arriving at the site. In the distance, hay bales were piled at least 20 feet high (presumably to test the drones' ability to navigate between buildings). A large, metallic blue platform in a far-off field provided a panoramic view of the surrounding farmland. Then we spotted it. Actually spying the drone — best seen through my colleague's long camera lens — was an anticlimax. Instead of performing a series of aerial acrobatics, the device merely bobbed along for about 20 minutes, slowly working its way from one side of the field to the other with barely a waver or shudder. The stakes for Amazon's drone test are unquestionably high. The next day, a police officer questioned my colleague as he again photographed the area, though the officer denied that Amazon had tipped him off. For places like Worsted Lodge — a sparsely populated area where farm animals easily outnumber residents — drones could fill an underserved niche of people with limited access to stores. But in many built-up urban areas, the arrival of drone delivery could quickly become a logistical nightmare — something the tests in the Cambridgeshire countryside would not soon solve. ""How will deliveries do the last 100 yards?"" said Jay Bregman, the founder of Verifly, a drone insurance start-up, when I called him for advice about the practicalities of such plans. ""In places like New York, that's going to be really difficult."""
0,2016-10-02," SAN FRANCISCO — When Amazon introduced its Echo device in late 2014, Google executives were caught off guard. For years, they had predicted the creation of a virtual assistant that would answer questions or help accomplish tasks, and they focused on building that capability into smartphones and tablets. Amazon took a different approach and created the Echo, a device with the sole purpose of showcasing the company's artificially intelligent assistant software, called Alexa. Since then, the Echo has become a surprise hit, vaulting Amazon ahead of Google in a race to build technology that interacts as humans do. Users can ask Alexa to play music, dim the lights or call for a ride. For Google, whose name is synonymous with finding answers on the internet, Amazon's success with Alexa exposed a vulnerability. Google, along with its parent company, Alphabet, has invested heavily to solve the technology world's toughest problems, but it often trails competitors in turning those advancements into products and businesses. On Tuesday, Google is expected to finally unveil its answer to the Echo, alongside new smartphones and tablets. The Google Home device, which looks a little like an air freshener, is expected to go on sale later this month. Google Home is powered by what Google calls the Assistant, which uses artificial intelligence to understand what users are saying and respond conversationally with the best answers. Google introduced a messaging app last month that incorporates the Assistant, and the company plans to add the feature to its latest smartphones and tablets. Given the newness of the market for artificially intelligent home gadgets, Google has plenty of time to close the gap. The company believes it can win over consumers with a smarter digital assistant that builds on its stronghold in search and years of research in artificial intelligence. But the fact that Google was outmaneuvered by Amazon — not Apple, which builds its own digital assistant technology, called Siri, into its mobile products — has caused head-scratching throughout the technology industry. Amazon has a notoriously uneven track record in making hardware, with some hits, like the Kindle e-reader, and spectacular whiffs, like the Fire Phone. ""Amazon is the accidental winner here,"" said Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at the Stern School of Business at New York University. ""Amazon got there first, which is superimpressive, and it has been a huge hit."" Google is a leader in natural language processing — the ability to turn spoken words into terms that computers can digest — and its search engine is the starting point for how most people get answers on the internet. In fact, the company says 20 percent of Google searches on mobile phones are done by voice. So why didn't Google create an Echo-like device before Amazon? In part, Google was hindered by a balkanized structure that prevented different groups within the company from working together, according to four current and former employees. Google, based in Mountain View, Calif., had a large team working on voice search but its focus was on an app for smartphones. The company had a separate team working on the Android operating system, which runs on smartphones, tablets and internet-connected home devices, and they were building virtual assistant technology into mobile devices. Google bought Nest Labs, a manufacturer of internet-connected thermostats and smoke detectors, for $3.2 billion in 2014 as an entree into the home. But the unit seldom collaborated with the rest of the company. And other Google hardware divisions responsible for building smartphones, tablets, Chromebook computers, Wi-Fi routers and Chromecast devices to stream video were focused on updating products. A competitor for the Echo, it seems, fell through the cracks. This is not the first time Amazon has jumped ahead of Google, despite the search company's considerable technological edge. From its inception, Google has devoted enormous resources to operating efficient data centers to power its many services. But it was Amazon that identified an opportunity in renting out its technology infrastructure to companies in need of computing power, storage and data analysis. That business, called Amazon Web Services, is now on pace to generate more than $10 billion in revenue this year, while Google is playing catch-up. A lack of focus can at times compound these issues. Google encourages its employees to spend 20 percent of their time pursuing new ideas beyond their usual responsibilities. Products like Gmail emerged from this policy, but it also fosters a mind-set that, according to one former employee, leads Google to chase too many ideas. ""Part of the problem is that it has a scattershot approach to things,"" said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. When pursuing new ideas, he said, ""they don't always make big bets strategically."" Google has spent seven years working on self-driving cars, for example, and it is still not clear how the company plans to cash in on its work. By contrast, Uber, which started as a company around the time that Google started work on autonomous vehicles, is already testing self-driving cars to pick up customers in Pittsburgh. Despite its many successes, Google has a spotty history of creating devices. In 2012, Google introduced an internet-connected speaker called the Nexus Q. The vision was for the device to plug into a home entertainment system for streaming music or video, a sort of hybrid of an Apple TV and a Sonos speaker. But Google killed the product before it even started shipping it to consumers. Also in 2012, Google bought the phone manufacturer Motorola for $12.5 billion. The next year, it introduced the Moto X, the first smartphone equipped with a listening chip so users could bring the phone to life by uttering the words ""O.K. Google."" It has pushed this feature into the latest phones running its Android operating system. Apple's more recent iPhones and iPads have a similar feature, activated by the words ""Hey Siri."" But what makes the Amazon Echo stand out is a technology called a far-field microphone that can make out someone's voice from across a room, even when there is background clatter. And the Echo is always in position to listen for the so-called wake word — Alexa — whereas phones are often tucked away in pockets and bags. According to a former employee, Google has tinkered with far-field audio, but its focus was on the car, not a home device. Amazon invested in artificial intelligence and speech technologies in the years before unveiling Echo, but its most crucial asset was its strength in the cloud computing market, which it dominates with Amazon Web Services, or A.W.S. The vast majority of Echo's intelligence is contained in A.W.S., and most of the apps that developers have built for Alexa run on the cloud service. ""The most important architectural vision is that it's all in the cloud,"" Dave Limp, Amazon's senior vice president for devices and services, said in an interview this year. Amazon says tens of thousands of developers are creating skills for Alexa, more than 3,000 of which have been released so far. And thousands of developers are working to incorporate Alexa's voice capabilities into their hardware products. Last month, GE Appliances announced an Alexa app that lets people preheat a connected oven with voice commands. Chris Herbert, chief executive of a start-up called TrackR that makes wireless beacons for finding misplaced keys and wallets, recently released an app for Alexa that allows people to find their items with voice commands. Mr. Herbert said he had looked at the voice offerings from both Google and Apple, but neither company yet offered the same range of capabilities as Amazon, because they viewed it as an add-on feature to phones as opposed to a stand-alone computer. ""It's kind of mind-boggling to me,"" he said."
0,2016-10-03," Google, for all its financial success and world-beating technology, has a problem: It often lags or is never even a player in markets it could have dominated. As Daisuke Wakabayashi and Nick Wingfield write, that's been the case with artificially intelligent home appliances. Two years ago, Amazon introduced its Echo device. The Echo is essentially a personal assistant. You can tell it to do things around the house, like play music or control internet-connected lights. The Echo became a surprise hit. And on Tuesday Google will finally release its competitor, called Google Home. That Google is two years behind Amazon with a competing home appliance is puzzling to some people in tech. It has some of the most advanced A.I. technology in the world and an unmatched database of terms thanks to its search engine. So what happened? As some people inside Google tell it, an A.I. home device fell through the cracks, in part because the company was so focused on building this sort of technology into mobile devices that use Google's Android operating system. There is plenty of time for Google to reel in Amazon. But the early miss on home A.I. tech shows that the company is vulnerable to new ideas — or different ways of thinking about older ideas. It can't afford to allow that to happen too many times. Silicon Valley veterans sometimes say the tech industry is built on the bones of older companies. Google executives must know this well, since part of the company's headquarters used to be the home of Silicon Graphics, a computer company that peaked two decades ago. The trick is to never become one of the dinosaurs."

2,2016-10-03," In the battle to dominate Europe's cloud computing market, American tech giants are spending big to build up their local credibility. Amazon Web Services, the largest player, announced last week that it would soon open multiple data centers in France and Britain. Google, which already has sites in countries like Finland and Belgium, is expected to finish a new multimillion-dollar data complex in the Netherlands by the end of the year. And Microsoft, by some measures the second-largest cloud computing provider in Europe, said on Monday that it had spent $1 billion in the last 12 months to expand its offerings, taking its total investment in European-based cloud services to $3 billion since 2005. ""We're building our global cloud infrastructure in Europe so it can be trusted by the multiple constituents,"" Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, said in an interview. ""We can meet the data residency needs of our European customers."" With many in Europe questioning why America's largest tech companies control how many of the region's 500 million citizens use everyday digital services, it is not surprising that the likes of Microsoft and Amazon are eager to play up their local roots. As the European Union continues to clamp down on the perceived misuse of people's digital information, analysts also say that many Silicon Valley giants are responding to these privacy concerns by increasingly offering individuals and companies the ability to keep information close to home, whereas in the past, data might have been stored solely in the United States. ""Countries like Germany are well aware of data privacy, and it has made them more wary of where data is kept,"" said Gregor Petri, a cloud computing analyst at the technology research firm Gartner in Veghel, the Netherlands. ""Local data sovereignty has become important, and American companies are now aware of that."" There is also a more basic explanation for American companies' expansion into European cloud computing: a growing amount of money to be made. Europe's market for so-called cloud application services, or software that is run virtually across the internet, is expected to more than double, to $16.1 billion, by the end of the decade, according to Gartner. That will still correspond to just one-third of the North American market, whose value is expected to reach $47 billion over the same period. Despite that relatively small size, Europe's market remains one of the largest for American cloud providers, many of which are increasing investments worldwide as companies and individuals increasingly rely on cloud-based services — such as iCloud, from Apple, and Dropbox, the online storage company — in their daily lives. In 2014, for instance, Amazon opened a number of data centers in Germany, partly in response to that country's strict privacy laws. Last year, Microsoft followed suit, teaming up with Deutsche Telekom — the local carrier and the owner of T-Mobile — which has control of the sites, again to comply with German legislation. (Microsoft charges a premium for the service.) In an interview, Rainer Strassner, manager of Microsoft's cloud program in Germany, said the country's law protected data stored on the servers there from information requests by foreign governments, including the United States. ""All the data stays in Germany,"" he said. The company recently won an appeal against the United States government, which had tried to obtain digital information held in a Microsoft data center in Ireland. While such investments have focused primarily on business customers, other American tech companies have made similarly large investments aimed at speeding up digital services for everyday users across the 28-member European Union. Apple, which has faced a number of European regulatory issues, including a demand that it repay $14.6 billion in back taxes to Ireland, is spending almost $2 billion building two data centers in the region. The facilities, its first such centers in Europe, will open in Denmark and Ireland by early 2018. Facebook is also working on its own Irish cloud computing center, while expanding an existing site in Sweden. ""We're starting deep in the forests of northern Sweden with the Lulea data center,"" Mark Zuckerberg, the company's chief executive, wrote on his Facebook page on Wednesday when talking about the Facebook's tech investments. ""You probably don't think about Lulea when you share with friends on Facebook, but it's an example of the incredibly complex technology infrastructure that keeps the world connected."""

1,2016-10-05," Blue Origin, the rocket company started by Jeffrey P. Bezos, the billionaire chief executive of Amazon, successfully separated a crew capsule from a rocket after it had lifted off on Wednesday, an important step toward Blue Origin's goal of carrying tourists into space. Before putting anyone on board its spacecraft, the company wants to make sure that its rockets' launch-abort system will carry passengers to safety if anything goes wrong during a flight. ""It's like the airbag in your car,"" Ariane Cornell said as she helped host Blue Origin's webcast of the test. ""It provides some peace of mind, but you're only going to use it if there's an emergency."" She said it was the first in-flight test of an abort system since those conducted by NASA's Apollo program in the 1960s. The Apollo tests also did not carry any people. Wednesday's launch was the latest for Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft, which was designed to take space tourists on a suborbital jaunt across the boundary 62 miles above Earth that is regarded as the edge of outer space. The tourists would see the curvature of the planet and the blackness of space while experiencing a few minutes of floating at the top of the arc. Blue Origin tested the escape system in 2012, but that was while the capsule was resting on a launchpad. This time, the capsule separated in flight, during the most stressful portion of the upward trajectory — 45 seconds after ignition, at an altitude of 16,000 feet, when the rocket was passing the speed of sound and experiencing maximum air pressure. A solid-fuel rocket at the bottom of the crew capsule fired for 1.8 seconds, exerting 70,000 pounds of force to quickly separate the capsule and steer it out of the way of the booster. Its parachutes deployed, and the capsule landed softly. If there had been any people aboard, ""it would have been exciting, certainly,"" Ms. Cornell said, ""but most importantly, you'd be safe."" The booster had not been expected to survive, but it managed to right itself, continue on to space, and then, firing its engine again, land a couple of miles north of the launchpad in West Texas, a bit charred but intact. Still, neither the capsule nor the booster will fly again. Improved versions will be ready for future test flights. Blue Origin is developing reusable rockets to reduce the cost of reaching space. This booster had launched four times previously, and the capsule had made six previous flights, including the 2012 test. By starting with a small suborbital rocket, the company is gaining experience in developing and launching reusable spacecraft. Test flights with people may begin as early as next year, and paying passengers, six at a time, may start coming aboard as early as 2018. Blue Origin has not yet announced a price for tickets. The company has announced that a larger rocket, New Glenn, capable of taking people and cargo to orbit, is to start launching from Cape Canaveral, Fla., by the end of the decade. An even larger rocket, New Armstrong, is on the drawing board. Mr. Bezos has said his vision is for millions of people to eventually live and work in space."
2,2016-10-05," Twelve years after the women of ""Sex and the City"" swilled their last cosmos, Sarah Jessica Parker is returning to HBO with a new series — one that might suggest her alter ego's long-awaited ""I love you"" didn't work out quite as planned. But don't expect Carrie Bradshaw in the 'burbs. In ""Divorce,"" debuting at 10 p.m. on Sunday, Oct. 9, Ms. Parker plays Frances, an arty type turned corporate recruiter navigating marital purgatory in Westchester County with her husband, Robert (Thomas Haden Church), a flailing real-estate developer, and their two children. But when a friend's 50th-birthday party turns amusingly violent, life's niggling disappointments explode into vivid relief, and some serious navel-gazing ensues. The show's title pretty much sums it up as Frances and Robert deal with each other's infidelities — hers physical, his emotional — and the flatlining of their union, and conclude that they're better off apart. If only they could make a clean break. The discourse, achingly knowing and bracingly comical, will ring familiar to fans of Amazon's ""Catastrophe"" and its gloriously sniping Sharon Horgan, this series's creator."
0,2016-10-07," SANTA MONICA, CALIF. — Say what you will about Ally McBeal — and, over the years, people have said a lot — she was a likable character, or at least she was intended to be. Same with Bobby Donnell, the morally squishy senior partner on ""The Practice,"" and the womanizing Alan Shore, of both ""The Practice"" and ""Boston Legal."" David E. Kelley, the creator and prolific writer of many of TV's most celebrated legal dramas, made them that way, partly for his own sanity. ""You go into a series knowing you might be writing it for five years,"" he said. ""I'll be in the shower, and these characters will be in my head. I'll be driving to work, and they'll be with me. The only way for me to survive that process is to write characters that I love."" But what if Mr. Kelley knew he'd be writing characters for, say, only one season rather than five? That, after an eight-episode run, he could scrap most or all of them and start fresh? Enter Billy McBride (Billy Bob Thornton), the liver-pickling lawyer in ""Goliath,"" Mr. Kelley's new series for Amazon. In the first couple of episodes, Billy gets dumped by his client, lands in the drunk tank and curses a judge in open court. Once considered among the finest trial lawyers in Los Angeles, he no longer is, presumably because he did something very, very bad. His antagonist, Donald Cooperman (William Hurt), is a disfigured, vengeful phantom, with nods to Batman's Two-Face and Captain Queeg, who heads up the enormous law firm, Cooperman McBride, that he and Billy once ruled together. ""I don't like many people in 'Goliath,'"" Mr. Kelley said with a laugh. ""But this is a one-off, so we had no burden to write these characters where they would be perpetually redeeming."" For the first time in his career, Mr. Kelley is bypassing broadcast television, where he won 10 Emmys for series that ran on ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox. Every episode of the straight-to-series order for Amazon will be available for viewing on the streaming service on Friday, Oct. 14. ""Whoosh,"" Mr. Kelley exclaimed, imagining the sound of all those episodes dropping at once. Mr. Kelley was here in his office recently, discussing ""Goliath"" and this foray into on-demand programming. At 60, Mr. Kelley looks like one of those lifelong surfers at Point Dume nearby. (Actually, he was the captain of Princeton's hockey team, before earning his law degree at Boston University.) On his desk is a yellow legal pad covered with scribbled notes; behind him is an expansive view of sunny downtown Santa Monica. A brief bike ride from his second-story office are two real-life 1950s-era beachfront dinosaurs that serve as series locales: Chez Jay, the dive bar where Billy does his best drinking, and the Ocean Lodge Hotel, Billy's residence (Room 214) and de facto law office. The deal with Amazon was struck 18 months ago, when Mr. Kelley went to Amazon Studios with his story about a down-and-out lawyer going up against a gigantic, morally questionable behemoth of a firm. There would be crooked military contractors; legal machinations behind closed doors; sun and sand and seediness; and one alcoholic, seriously outgunned lawyer facing the battle of his life, à la Paul Newman in Sidney Lumet's 1982 film ""The Verdict."" ""We went to them first,"" Mr. Kelley said of Amazon. ""We were prepared to make the rounds, but they got very enthused and kind of made a pre-emptive offer for it."" Morgan Wandell, the head of drama series at Amazon Studios, recalled that Mr. Kelley ""was really passionate about wanting to do an underdog kind of story. He sort of had us at the pitch."" The show's co-creator, Jonathan Shapiro, a former federal prosecutor and trial lawyer, has firsthand knowledge about the world the series inhabits. Mr. Shapiro was the defense procurement fraud coordinator in the United States attorney's office in Los Angeles (the series begins with a mysterious explosion at sea), and worked with lawyers, many with military backgrounds, who formed the basis of the William Hurt character. He was employed at a Goliath — Kirkland & Ellis — for two years, although that firm, he insisted, didn't engage in the sort of dirty dealings and chicanery that his fictional one routinely does. ""I want to be absolutely clear that Cooperman McBride is not based on Kirkland & Ellis,"" he said. After a career spent on broadcast television, Mr. Kelley had become frustrated of late with the medium. Over the years, 48 minutes to tell a story had dwindled to 40, and there were longer commercial breaks. His last show, ""Harry's Law,"" with Kathy Bates, was canceled in 2012 after two seasons because its audience skewed too old for NBC and its advertisers. Mr. Kelley was finding the structure of network shows limiting: ""Sometimes, just by virtue of having to break it up into acts, you'd have this artificial, melodramatic moment to go 'boom' before you cut to the Dodge Ram commercial, just to make sure the audience came back,"" he said. With ""Goliath,"" Mr. Kelley has nearly a solid hour of uninterrupted programming each episode. Scenes can go longer; characters can have more time and room to stretch out. ""Billy Bob and William Hurt are very very patient, cognitive actors,"" he said. ""When they pause, when they take a breath, there's a reason for it. And it's nice not to have to edit out and truncate a lot of those beats, because some of the richest parts of the series are played with silent looks and subtext."" Mr. Wandell compared it with ""losing yourself in a great novel."" ""Or if you're a Billy Bob Thornton fan,"" he added, ""it's a chance to watch an eight-hour Billy Bob Thornton movie."" At Amazon, Mr. Kelley is accomplishing another personal first: focusing on a single case over the series' eight-episode run. (If the series is picked up for a second season, he said, it would be ""populated with a lot of different characters."") ""When we were doing closed-ended, one-hour episodes, it was hard to really meet the ancillary players and get a sense of who they were,"" he said. ""There was a doctor expert witness or a scientist, and you knew what their skill set was, but you didn't really know about them. Here, one of the joys is getting to creep inside the personas of all these people as well."" Not that Mr. Kelley, once dubbed the king of prime time, doesn't still love the medium where he made his name. ""I think I'll always be grateful for broadcast,"" he said. ""Part of me would still love those big networks to maybe morph a little bit with changing times to compete with this new form of storytelling. Because here's what the broadcast networks can do: They can deliver to big audiences in a way that the others can't. We'd all love for our product to be seen by more people rather than less."""
0,2016-10-12," For years, Amazon has been a quiet but potent force in the music industry, selling more CDs and vinyl albums than any other retailer. But its latest foray into digital music may prove disruptive both in the way it connects to people's homes and in the amount of money it will cost. On Wednesday, the company unveils Amazon Music Unlimited, a streaming service that will compete directly with Spotify, Apple Music and every other outlet in the increasingly crowded on-demand audio market. Like most of those, Amazon's offering will have a catalog of tens of millions of songs, offering essentially most commercially available music. That is a big increase from Amazon's two-year-old Prime Music service, which caters to a casual audience with playlists and just two million tracks, a fraction of the songs other services offer. Amazon's wrinkle, however, will be in how it allows its customers to listen. The new service is closely tied to Amazon's Echo devices, a line of speakers with a proprietary voice recognition technology called Alexa. Instead of fiddling with a phone, a customer can simply give the speaker commands like, ""Alexa, play the new Bruno Mars song,"" and the track starts immediately. Echo speakers can also be used to get access to other streaming services, including Spotify, Pandora and iHeartRadio, but its more advanced features, like combing through lyrics, will work only with Amazon's service. ""We think the next phase of growth for streaming is really going to come in the home,"" Steve Boom, Amazon's vice president of digital music, said in an interview. Since it was introduced two years ago, Amazon's speaker line — which includes the cylindrical Echo, for $180, and two cheaper models, Tap and Dot — has become a surprise hit, and the company has been expanding its services for the connected home. The technology can be used to check the weather, order a pizza and, of course, buy stuff from Amazon. It is already causing competitive ripples. Google introduced its own version and the connected-speaker company Sonos announced an Amazon partnership, in what was widely interpreted as an ""if you can't beat 'em, join 'em"" moment. While Apple's Siri has long had the ability to answer voice commands, Amazon's speakers and new music service represent a new frontier. In some ways they work to create a so-called lean-back experience, letting people play the music of their choice with a minimum of effort. According to Amazon, one of the most popular commands on the service is simply, ""Alexa, play music,"" which generates a Pandora-like playlist based on a customer's past listening. But as with Siri, it is hard not to try to stump Alexa's electronic brain. Amazon says it has applied machine learning to anticipate conversational inquiries, like searching for lyrics or half-remembered titles. For example, say, ""Alexa, play that song that goes 'put up a parking lot,' "" and the speaker will play Counting Crows' version of the Joni Mitchell classic ""Big Yellow Taxi."" (Purists may cringe, but this version was chosen because it is the most popular one on Amazon. ""Alexa, play the song that goes 'put up a parking lot' from the '70s"" will bring forth Ms. Mitchell's original.) The cost of Amazon's new service may have even more impact. The standard price for Music Unlimited is $10 a month, the same as Spotify, Apple Music and most others. For members of Amazon's Prime program — which costs $99 a year and brings perks like free shipping and access to online videos — it will cost an additional $8 a month, or $79 a year, a discount that itself represents a triumph of negotiation, since a year ago the major record labels balked at Apple's wanting to charge less than $10 for Apple Music. But for customers who own an Echo device, Amazon will offer the service at just $4 a month, deeply undercutting its competitors. That price comes with a restriction: The service can be used on a single Echo device and nowhere else, like a phone or a computer. But the price is far lower than has ever been charged for what is essentially a complete catalog of music online — except for outlets like YouTube and Spotify's free version, which charge nothing but have advertising. ""Alexa, will this lead to a digital music price war?"" It just might."
0,2016-10-13," In the opening episode of the new Amazon series ""Goliath,"" Billy Bob Thornton, playing a Los Angeles lawyer who has seen better days, snaps: ""I used to handle 20 cases at a time. I think I can handle two."" Was this David E. Kelley, who, with Jonathan Shapiro, created and wrote the show, getting in a little dig at himself? You could imagine — actually, it was hard not to imagine — Mr. Kelley saying: ""I used to handle three shows at a time and write 50 or 60 episodes a year. I think I can handle a 10-episode web series."" As a group, the most successful of the old-school broadcast-network producers — people like Dick Wolf, Chuck Lorre and Jerry Bruckheimer — have resisted the lure of the streaming services. Mr. Kelley used to be in that league, but his last real hit was ""Boston Legal"" eight years ago. So when ""Goliath"" was announced, you could hope that the creative freedom offered by a short-season online production (which Amazon took straight to series, without requiring a pilot) would have a rejuvenating effect. Through two episodes, the jury is still out. With ""Goliath,"" which is available in full on Friday, the famously prolific Mr. Kelley, a former lawyer, returns to the legal drama. (It's the seventh he's created.) He also returns to Los Angeles, the setting of the best show he's been associated with, ""L.A. Law."" It's a David and Goliath story, as the title half-indicates, though the main character, Mr. Thornton's Billy McBride, is definitely the David. The action begins with a series of quick scenes establishing how down and out he is: released from jail, missing a court date, told to shape up by his teenage daughter, sitting on a beachside bench and pulling a bottle of whiskey out of a paper bag. That opening is promising — quick, textured, with a sense of place and a reliably prickly performance from Mr. Thornton. And as the story unspools, the part of it in which McBride figures continues to be entertaining, in a been-there-done-that kind of way — it's reasonably well executed Los Angeles noir, shot on picturesque Santa Monica and Venice locations, and carrying just the faintest echoes of John D. MacDonald and ""The Long Goodbye."" But then there's the other half of the show's odd bordering-on-bizarre split personality. The Goliath of the story is a behemoth of a law firm where McBride was once a partner; whenever the scene shifts there, the tone and rhythm change. Suddenly we're in an arch, slick, hyped-up TV legal show, with lawyers marching in formation and exchanging withering put-downs. The staff includes a dragon-lady associate (Molly Parker), a faint reminder of ""Ally McBeal""; and a young lawyer (Olivia Thirlby) with an anxiety disorder who stutters in court. In contrast to Mr. Thornton's naturalistic portrayal of McBride, we get William Hurt breathing hard as McBride's nemesis, a ghoulish figure with a scarred face who sits in a red-lighted room watching surveillance video of his employees. Clearly, Mr. Kelley and Mr. Shapiro are trying to accentuate the contrast between their David and their Goliath, but they have ended up with what feels like two different shows. Some things we can probably count on. Mr. Kelley and Mr. Shapiro (they worked together on ""The Practice"" and ""Boston Legal"") will serve up a snappy piece of dialogue every few minutes. Mr. Thornton, even in one of his more routine performances, will be a pleasure to watch. And while many of the actresses have trouble animating their slightly cartoonish roles — Ms. Parker, Ms. Thirlby and Tania Raymonde as a combination prostitute and legal secretary — Nina Arianda will continue to be the best reason to watch the show. She's fearless and hilarious as the low-rent lawyer and real estate agent who drags McBride into the case. When she deadpans, ""He'll be here, the hooker just texted,"" it could be ""L.A. Law"" all over again."
0,2016-10-15," Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week's news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Jim Kerstetter, the deputy technology editor in San Francisco, and Nick Wingfield, technology reporter in Seattle, are filling in for Farhad and Mike this week. Jim: Hi, everyone. Apologies in advance to the people who came here expecting Mike and Farhad and their witty, bromantic discussion of the week's tech news. They are, sadly, out of the office this week. But don't worry! As your one-week-only fill-ins, you'll have two middle-aged guys discussing the finer points of progressive lenses, teen parenting and why Subarus are terrific in the snow. But before our Click and Clack impression — tech news! Nick, you've been covering consumer electronics since the ""laptop"" computer came in a wheeled suitcase. Have you ever seen something like Samsung's problems with burning Galaxy Note 7 phones? Nick: There have certainly been recalls of overheating and exploding laptops, including one by Dell a decade ago that involved defective batteries made by Sony. Samsung's problems are of a different order, though. The company is such a high-profile player in a market that is so much bigger than laptops ever were and they're just yanking the Note 7, their flagship phone, off the market completely. Beyond the direct sales losses from this model, how badly damaged will the sales of future models be? It's not hard to imagine Samsung-inclined customers buying iPhones because they feel like Apple's devices aren't going to, you know, blow up on them. Jim: See, that's just it. The phones are nice and all, but that whole ""it'll blow up on you"" would keep me from buying it — if I could. A friend told me the story of a college professor with a student who had the latest take on ""the dog ate my homework"": My phone torched my homework. He even had a burn on his leg to prove it. Bad as this is for Samsung, I don't see anyone other than Apple capitalizing on it in the high-end of the smartphone business. At least not right away. This is a gift for Apple: Wacky wireless earbuds or not, they're going to have the most profitable part of the smartphone business pretty much to themselves. Samsung has problems. But what about a company that can't seem to do anything right? I speak, of course, of Yahoo. It looks like Verizon, which announced plans to buy Yahoo for $4.8 billion in July, is doing some saber-rattling about that gigantic hack that Yahoo disclosed a few weeks back. Looks like they may want a discount. So here's my question: Do you think Verizon bought themselves a pig in a poke? Nick: Verizon is like the person who buys a used car only to find out it needs a new transmission a week later. For now, the public rhetoric is pretty cordial between the companies, which suggests that they still want to find a way to work this out. Do you think any concession Verizon ends up getting on price is in the billions or millions? Jim: It's hard to say until the forensic investigation of the hack is finished. There was one report that they were looking for a $1 billion price cut. But it's hard for me to imagine Yahoo would go along with that. What about companies that aren't dying? Amazon has had a lot going on this week. Nick: That's right. Amazon finally launched its much-anticipated subscription music service and, as they usually do, they want to use price to shake up the market. They are masters of the upsell. They got a lot of attention for offering a music subscription plan for $4 a month, well below the $10 that Spotify and Apple charge. But you can only get that plan if you get their $99 Prime membership and you can only listen to it on one of their Echo devices, not on your mobile phone. It's like the food samples they hand out at the supermarket — tasty, but you're going to need to pay more if you want a real meal. Jim: So instead of asking ""Would you like fries with that?"" They say, ""Would you like a burger with your fries?"" Clever! Maybe not as clever as coming out with an artificially intelligent home appliance a few years before their competitors, like they did with the Echo. But pretty sharp. Well, that does it for us for this week. Sorry we didn't get into that Subaru discussion!"

0,2016-10-18," Donald Trump has become the country's most notorious tax shirker. And while his long avoidance of federal income taxes is extreme, it's also part of a larger problem. The most affluent and powerful parts of our society have too easy a time legally avoiding taxes. Consider corporate taxes, which ultimately tend to be paid by the well-off, because they own the most stock. The official corporate rate is 35 percent, infamously higher than in any other advanced economy. Yet there are so many loopholes that companies often pay relatively little in tax. Many companies work hard to shroud how much they really pay, sprinkling various figures throughout their complex financial statements. But companies must report one number that provides a good glimpse. It's called cash taxes paid — the combined amount that a company pays in federal, state, local and even foreign taxes. I asked the analysts at S&P Global Market Intelligence to calculate this number since 2007 for this country's 500 largest public companies, and the results reveal a broken tax system. Fixing it should be an early priority for the next president. If Hillary Clinton wins, it may well be. A good case study is Amazon, which pays a rate much lower than its more traditional retail competitors. Between 2007 and last year, the company paid only 13 percent of its profits in taxes. Remember: That's not just federal taxes. It's federal, state, local and foreign taxes. How does Amazon get away with this? A tangle of tax breaks and loopholes, some enacted in the name of creating jobs despite meager evidence that they do. For many companies, the key move is opening offices in a low-tax country like Ireland and then claiming that much of their business flows through those offices. Put all these tax breaks together, and you end up with our system. AT&T and General Electric each paid a combined tax rate of only 18 percent since 2007, according to the S&P data. Coca-Cola, Apple and IBM paid 17 percent, and Alphabet (Google's parent) is at 16 percent. Boeing is at 8 percent, Facebook at 4 percent. And the following tax rate will sound familiar to anyone who has been watching the presidential campaign: PG&E, the California-based utility company, has paid zero net taxes since 2007. In fact, it has paid negative taxes, receiving tax breaks more valuable than its tax payments. ""The tax code, on the business side and the personal side, is a rotting economic carcass,"" Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, told me. ""All these games are significantly eroding the American tax base."" The inequities contribute to the great American stagnation that I described in last week's column. The billions of dollars in taxes being avoided by G.E., Coca-Cola and others is money that can't be used to lift living standards for ordinary families: It can't be used to reduce their taxes and can't pay for schools, medical research or clean energy. There is another victim, too — one easily forgotten in this populist time. Many large companies do indeed pay a lot of taxes. For one reason or another, these companies can't take advantage of loopholes and must pay a rate much closer to the official one. Brick-and-mortar retailers, for example, aren't as politically popular as manufacturers or technology companies and haven't persuaded Congress to create a lot of special tax breaks. Retailers also can't easily pretend their business is based overseas. As a result, CVS, Home Depot, Walmart and Target have all been paying a combined tax rate of more than 30 percent, more than twice as high as Amazon's rate. This system is cumbersome — causing companies to devote great effort to tax avoidance — and unfair. A better system could lift economic growth, by directing more of investors' money to truly promising companies, rather than tax-advantaged ones. Fortunately, there are signs of hope. Overhauling the corporate tax code is a rare issue on which the two parties have some common ground. If the Democrats take the Senate, Wyden is in line to lead the Finance Committee and says its first priority will be a big bill to improve roads, bridges and public transit systems (and create jobs). The second will be a corporate-tax bill to pay for the infrastructure. Both are good ideas. As strong as the case for change is, corporate-tax reform will still cause a nasty political fight. Companies make millions of dollars from tax avoidance. To defend the status quo, some will devise clever arguments to suggest that a new system would somehow destroy jobs or otherwise wreak havoc. They will pretend they're just looking out for the rest of us. Don't be fooled."
0,2016-10-26," A year and a half after ending ""Mad Men"" on a note of enlightenment and a Coca-Cola jingle, Matthew Weiner is apparently ready to return to television. Mr. Weiner has signed on to create an eight-episode contemporary anthology series for Amazon. Mr. Weiner will serve as creator and executive producer for the still-untitled show, and also share writing and directing duties. The production deal is worth $70 million, according to Deadline, which first reported the project, and will be cofinanced by the Weinstein Company and Amazon. No premiere date has been set for the series. ""In a time when there are so many options for entertainment, it's been tremendous to see how Roy Price and Amazon have taken center stage by distinguishing themselves through bold choices,"" Mr. Weiner said in a statement. ""I am truly excited to have this opportunity to work with risk takers like them and Harvey and the Weinstein Company who have a proven, longstanding commitment to creative voices and innovation."" ""Mad Men"" on AMC racked up critical praise and 116 Emmy Award nominations over its seven seasons, including four consecutive wins for outstanding drama series — only the fourth show to do so. Mr. Weiner won seven Emmys as the creator and a writer on ""Mad Men"" to go with two he won as a writer and producer for ""The Sopranos."" Amazon shows like ""Transparent"" and ""Mozart in the Jungle"" have won Emmy Awards, but never in the major series categories. Mr. Weiner's most recent television work came earlier this year, when he directed an episode of Netflix's ""Orange Is the New Black."" He also has sold a novel, ""Heather, the Totality,"" to Little, Brown and Company that is due out next year."
0,2016-10-27," One of the most quotable scenes in ""Mad Men"" comes after Joan (Christina Hendricks) endures a meeting with male colleagues who harass her with sexual innuendos. Afterward, she tells her co-worker Peggy (Elisabeth Moss), ""I want to burn this place down."" Amazon's ""Good Girls Revolt,"" set around the same time, takes a group of ticked-off women in a Manhattan office and gives them a match and a big pile of newsprint for kindling. But despite energy and a surprisingly timely premise, it generates only sparks and smoke. The series, whose 10-episode first season arrives on Friday, picks up roughly where ""Mad Men"" left off in themes and time period, but shifts the feminism that percolated in its predecessor front and center. The stage is the fictional News of the Week magazine in late 1969, where young female researchers fetch coffee and do the reporting legwork for male writers. The men get all the bylines and earn three times the salary. (They also indulge in the kind of ""locker-room talk"" about women that you haven't heard since, er, the last time you watched the news.) Dana Calvo developed the series from the book ""The Good Girls Revolt"" by Lynn Povich, about a landmark gender-discrimination case at Newsweek. Its story involves some real-life figures, including the journalist Nora Ephron (Grace Gummer) and Eleanor Holmes Norton (Joy Bryant), the American Civil Liberties Union activist who will eventually shepherd the equal-opportunity complaint. But first, the pilot introduces three researchers at various stages of wokeness. Patti (Genevieve Angelson) is the wild child — ""a hippie astronaut on re-entry,"" she's described without irony. Jane (Anna Camp) is the prim blue blood. Cindy (Erin Darke), an introverted would-be novelist in a stultifying marriage, is in between them (and is the one who feels most like a person rather than a type). The season takes its time unfolding the discrimination case, settling in as a fizzy workplace drama with plenty of hookups, journalistic capers and office politics. The editor, Finn (Chris Diamantopoulos), an up-and-comer with a bad case of Rolling Stone envy, knocks antlers with his old-school deputy, Wick (Jim Belushi). Everyone feels the aphrodisiac charge of power; this is newsmagazines' heyday, the era when a Time magazine cover could rhetorically kill God. But the women at News of the Week are stuck, as the Ephron character puts it, ""fighting over the lower bunk bed in jail."" All the elevators, scotch and pheromones naturally bring to mind a certain other Manhattan office in the 1960s. Is it unfair to compare ""Good Girls Revolt"" with ""Mad Men""? You bet. Is it possible not to? You try, especially when it begins an episode with Peggy Lee's ""Is That All There Is?,"" prominently featured in the final half-season opener of ""Mad Men."" The true measure of the series, though, is the challenge of every period drama: to make the characters feel as if they live in their own present, not in our past hindsight. This is the biggest weakness of ""Good Girls Revolt,"" which feels more playacted than lived in. It fills up a bingo card of references — Buffalo Springfield's ""For What It's Worth,"" a free-love party at the Chelsea Hotel. The title sequence is practically a visual dictionary of ""We Didn't Start the Fire""-grade boomer touchstones: a lava lamp, a joint, dog tags, a wheel of birth control pills. The dialogue is pat and nudging. When a certain researcher quits the magazine after daring to take credit for her own writing, Wick scolds her: ""Your name is all you have in journalism. So good luck, Nora Ephron!"" It's clever, but it's also a kind of Paul Harvey ""Rest of the Story"" moment that lets us feel easily superior. (Ms. Gummer's self-possessed Ephron is a highlight of the pilot, but she then disappears for half the season.) The series is astute about the way women can internalize sexism (like the magazine's publisher, a woman who has no interest in elevating the researchers), as well as the oblivious entitlement of the younger male writers, even Patti's relatively enlightened boyfriend, Doug (Hunter Parrish). And it would be hard to call the show's depiction of sexism too on-the-nose for its time, or maybe even ours. ""Good Girls Revolt,"" after all, arrives during the ""nasty woman"" election, a contest whose gender politics, as subtle as a Punch and Judy show, are straight out of a 1960s time capsule. In the current climate, the show is almost like an origin story. In 1969, Hillary Rodham (like Ephron, a Wellesley woman) was giving a commencement address that won her notice in Life magazine. Donald J. Trump was fresh out of college with a medical deferment from the draft, steeped in the paleo-Hefner masculinity that wafts through the hallways of News of the Week like Aqua Velva. It's as if the TV gods are telling us, you've come a long way, baby — and you've come full circle. Even a story line in which a women's-encounter group encourages the repressed Cindy to familiarize herself with her vagina feels suddenly topical; what Mr. Trump bragged about grabbing, she's grabbing back. That serendipity makes ""Good Girls Revolt"" a little like a newsmagazine cover story — well-timed, well-meaning, with a few smart takes. It just misses the nuance and rounded characters that separate timeless fiction from the news of the week."
1,2016-10-27," SEATTLE — For the last several quarters, Amazon delighted investors by delivering something unusual for the company: a bumper crop of profits. But Amazon profits were in shorter supply in its most recent quarter than Wall Street analysts had pined for, and could vanish entirely over the holidays as the company pours money into building warehouses and making original movie and television productions. So after months of exuberance that pushed Amazon's shares to new highs, investors took a break, sending the company's stock down more than 5 percent after it reported its latest financial results. Amazon had warned investors not to get too comfortable with its record run of profits, promising last quarter that big increases on warehouse spending would come in the second half of the year so it can handle what it expects to be a crush of holiday orders. It is also cranking out more original video productions like ""The Man in the High Castle"" and ""Transparent,"" to turn its Prime membership service into an attractive alternative to Netflix. Analysts took those warnings with a Himalayan-size heap of salt. They had heard such talk from the company before about increasing investments, only to see Amazon later deliver bigger-than-expected profits. Surely, Amazon was just sandbagging again. ""They said something similar about last quarter and crushed it,"" said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. ""I think people expected they would do that again."" Instead, Amazon reported a profit of $252 million, or 52 cents a share, for the third quarter, well below the 78 cents a share average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. That figure still represented more than three times the $79 million profit it reported in the same period last year, and Amazon's corresponding operating income of $575 million was at the high end of the range that the company had previously forecast. Revenue grew 29 percent to $32.7 billion, slightly above what analysts forecast at $32.69 billion. Many of the pistons of Amazon's growth seemed to be firing during the quarter, especially Amazon Web Services, the cloud-computing business that has emerged as its biggest source of profits — despite being only 10 percent of its total revenue. Sales from A.W.S. grew 55 percent to $3.23 billion, while operating income more than doubled to $861 million. Amazon's biggest quarter is now coming up — the end-of-year season when shoppers go wild for presents and have increasingly turned to the e-commerce giant to buy them. But Amazon's forecast for the quarter was worrisome to some analysts. The company told them to expect as much as $1.25 billion in operating income for the fourth quarter and as little as nothing, a remarkably wide range. Amazon projected that revenue would increase in a range of 17 to 27 percent over a year ago. ""I think the big concern here is Amazon moving into another big, deep investment cycle,"" said Neil Doshi, an analyst at Mizuho Securities. Asked about the gap between Amazon's results in the third quarter and expectations, Brian Olsavsky, the chief financial officer of Amazon, said, in effect, we told you so. In a conference call, he said Amazon opened 18 fulfillment centers during the quarter, triple the normal rate. It will double its spending on video content production and marketing during the second half of the year compared with the same period last year. ""It was built into the guidance,"" Mr. Olsavsky said."
0,2016-10-28," Q. Do you have to have a Kindle to borrow e-books from the library? Can you use a different device or computer instead? A. While you generally need a Kindle device or Kindle reading app to borrow e-books in the Kindle format, many public libraries offer e-books in other formats that work on a wide variety of devices. Visit the website of your local library to see what software is needed to check out and read e-books in other formats. Most major libraries have dedicated, easy-to-find sections of their sites devoted to lending electronic materials — the Atlanta-Fulton Public Library system, Boston Public Library, Louisville Free Public Library, the Salt Lake City Public Library system and the San Francisco Public Library are just a few around the country. The E-Book Central page on the site of the New York Public Library explains all the options for borrowing digital content and has links to the library's own reading app, NYPL SimplyE, for Android and iOS devices. Depending on the library, you can install free software and borrow books in formats compatible with the Axis 360 digital media service, cloudLibrary or Adobe Digital Editions software. Thousands of libraries around the country use software and services from OverDrive.com to lend e-books. The site has a list of libraries nationwide that offer e-books and other digital content — and instructions on how to borrow them. The OverDrive site has its own free reading app for borrowing electronic material on Amazon and Nook tablets, as well as on Android, iOS and Windows Phone devices. OverDrive software is also available for Google Chrome, Windows and Mac computers if you want to read on a laptop or desktop computer. For a streamlined approach, the Kobo Aura One e-reader allows you to check out OverDrive-managed content directly from the Kobo book catalog instead of having to use Adobe Digital Editions to read the e-books, but not every library supports the Aura One device yet. In addition to the software required by the library, you typically need a valid library card from the institution to borrow electronic books and other downloadable content. Check with your local branch for specific information on e-book lending periods, renewals and returns."
0,2016-10-29," Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week's news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Farhad: Hello, Mike! I hope we can make this a quick chat, as I've still got a lot of work to do on my Halloween costume. I'm going as Sexy Donald Trump. Mike: That is truly terrifying. Speaking of which, I'm going as celebrity chef Guy Fieri. Do you have a bowling shirt with flames on it that I can borrow for the weekend? Farhad: Oh yeah, I have many. I make so many trips to Flavor Town! On to the news. Let's start with personal computers. Remember those? Mike: Like the old Gateway 2000 we had growing up? My favorite thing about those computers was that they came in a box that was painted white and splotchy black like a cow. Because I definitely think of livestock while I'm computing. Farhad: Yeah, well, apparently not only do personal computers still exist, but if you've got a lot of money to spend, they can be pretty awesome. Take the Surface Studio, which Microsoft unveiled at a press conference in New York this week. It's, get this, a desktop computer, a device that was first invented in the Jurassic period, I think. But still, it looked pretty sweet. The machine is basically a flat sheet of glass mounted on a hinge, allow creative professionals to use it as a traditional desktop or a large drafting table. Microsoft also showed off a really intriguing accessory for the Studio, a physical dial that you turn to perform very precise functions (like zooming) on the machine. Mike: I could see that being pretty cool if I had artistic talent. Usually those folks like those big Wacom tablets, but this seems to have a different type of interface — drawing directly on the screen, for example — that could win that crowd over. Farhad: Microsoft was widely ridiculed when it began building its own computers a few years ago (that first Surface was a stinker). But I have to say, they've really done wonders since then. This new Surface — which, alas, starts at $3,000 — was the most interesting computer design I've seen in a long time. And that includes the other company that showed off some new computers this week. Can you guess which company that was? Mike: Um, Gateway? Farhad: No, I meant Apple. The Mac company put out a new line of laptops, including a couple of high-end machines that include something called the Touch Bar. It's a little touch-screen mounted at the top of the keyboard that offers a range of controls that adapt to whatever software you're using at the moment. I tried it out at Apple's press event this week, and in my short demo it looked quite handy, but it's expensive. Mac machines with the Touch Bar start at $1,800. Mike: I guess that's cool. Everyone is criticizing it because you have to look down at the keyboard to use it instead of, say, typing on the buttons we have there now without looking down. Am I crazy, or am I the only guy who still needs to look at the keyboard in the unlikely event I am required to press F8? Farhad: Yeah, you're crazy. Never press F8. Never. O.K., let's touch on some earnings reports, because I know you love those. After previously warning investors that it would soon start spending heavily to invest in its core business, Amazon reported that it had kept to its word and spent a lot of dough. But apparently investors weren't expecting that, despite the company's warning. So Amazon's profits came in below analysts' expectations, which sent the stock price slipping. But here's what I found interesting. Amazon, which is the most opaque large company in tech, told investors that it was expecting a remarkably wide range in business performance in the holiday quarter. Operating income could come in as high as $1.25 billion at the high end — or $0 at the low end. Who knows, right? Basically Amazon is like one of those baked kids in ""Dazed and Confused"" contemplating the emptiness of it all: Like, hey, man, we could make a whole lot or we could make nothing, man, what does any of it matter on this pale blue dot out here in the middle of nothingness, you know what I mean, man? Mike: I do, in fact, know what you mean. The philosophy of Matthew McConaughey guides many of my life choices, especially the character he played in that movie. Anyway, I think at this point Amazon can tell investors whatever they want — ""Profit? Who knows? Who cares?"" — and Wall Street will eventually get in line and keep singing the company's praises. Tech companies are good at not caring what analysts think. Farhad: A couple of companies went on cost-cutting missions this week, though for totally different reasons. Alphabet, the holding company that Google created to manage its many non-search-related businesses, said that it was halting further expansion of its Google Fiber project. Fiber is a plan to build superfast fiber-optic internet access in cities across the country, a mission that has always seemed a little crazy in its expense and ambition. Now, citing a need for greater financial discipline, Google is going to lay off Fiber. Please please don't make a joke about digestion. Mike: Whatever do you mean? I'm just happy to see Google is staying regular. Uh, in its ambitions. In all seriousness, this is a bummer, because my Comcast connection at home is the definition of terrible and unreliable. No competition within markets makes me very sad, even if I do get to make a fiber joke. Farhad: And then, finally, there was Twitter, which woke reporters up at 4 a.m. on the West Coast to deliver its financial results. The struggling social network said it would lay off 350 people and would essentially shut down Vine, the once-popular looping video app. Man, I feel like I think about Twitter's mortality more frequently than my own. Is there any good news this time? Mike: Actually, yes! They added more new users than everyone expected, and while their revenue growth is in decline, it still beat analysts' estimates. Also, layoffs can be seen a few ways. It's always painful and you can't cheer when a company does it. Real people and their lives are affected by them. That being said, Twitter employs 3,900 people, and for the life of me I couldn't tell you what most of them actually do all day. I'm not sure they could, either. So, perhaps this was something that was a long time coming, as many people around the company will grudgingly admit. Anyway, they're doing O.K., considering. The stock price went up, which is good, I guess. Too bad Vine is going away. I've spent the past few days watching hilarious and weird vines on my computer. I highly recommend it. Farhad: I loved the idea of Vine, but I never really watched many. Guess that was the problem. Anyway, see you next week!"
0,2016-11-01," President Obama once promised that the Obamacare exchanges would make buying insurance as easy as selecting a TV on Amazon. Just a few clicks, and you could comparison-shop and pick the plan that's right for you. In a way, the president was right: The marketplaces set up under the Affordable Care Act make a really confusing and expensive purchase a lot easier. But insurance remains a complex financial product. Making the best choice is going to depend on your values and preferences, and some good luck in predicting your future health. That's why, even three years into Obamacare, many customers are still relying on one-on-one meetings with experts, who ask the right questions and help steer people to the plan that's likely to be best for them. And it's the reason I still get calls every year from friends and colleagues asking me which employer plan they should choose. We wanted to try to help make a tricky choice a little easier. Obamacare customers can start selecting their 2017 plans today, and fall is open enrollment season for a lot of companies, too. We made flow charts to explain how to choose, one for people buying insurance on the Obamacare marketplace, another for those choosing an employer-sponsored plan. We got advice from groups that provide in-person assistance, economists who have studied insurance choices and executives at companies that are devising products to help make choosing easier. These are simple charts, so there may be special considerations for certain people with distinct needs (more about that later). But this boiled-down process is intended to address the most important questions you will face as you compare any array of plans with metallic names or obtuse abbreviations. Let's start out with one important point: Unless you can afford to pay millions of dollars without blinking, you should really have health insurance to protect against financial ruin. About one in five Americans spends more than $5,000 on health care in a given year, and about one in 20 spends more than $10,000. If uninsured, you are exposed to huge bills when unexpected things happen. Insurance can be expensive, and some people still struggle to afford it. But if you can squeeze a health plan into your budget, our advice is: Do it. Our questions are intended to help you think about three key issues in choosing insurance. The numbers are devised for single people buying coverage for themselves. Payment and income cutoffs will be a little different for people shopping for family coverage. This can be a tough question to answer, because health emergencies often come without warning. But some people know ahead of time that they are going to use a lot of health care services. If you have an expensive chronic condition that requires a lot of drugs and doctors' visits, or you have a planned surgery or will be having a baby, you are better off buying more generous insurance that will pay for more of your health care. A number of companies have now put together calculators that can help you estimate just how much health care you are likely to use for conditions you know about. And at least one is trying to use data from large numbers of patients to calculate the odds that something unexpected — like an accident or a heart attack — might happen to you. None of these tools are perfect, but they will probably get better over time, eliminating the need for patients to do their own back-of-the-envelope estimating about what their care will cost under different plans. Generally speaking, the experts I spoke to said that anyone with known health problems should buy a plan with a reasonable co-pay after a deductible under $2,000 — for Obamacare shoppers, plans that are designed to cover around 70 percent of expenses are typically called silver. But people with major health care needs should shop for more generous plans, and may benefit more from reading the detailed ""summary of benefits and coverage"" documents about limits on certain kinds of visits, or the details of co-payments and deductibles. For Obamacare shoppers, there is one exception to this advice: people who earn incomes less than twice the federal poverty level. A single person earning less than $24,000 or a family of four with an income less than $49,000 is nearly always best off buying a ""silver"" plan. Because of extra subsidies, you'll end up with the equivalent of a more generous ""gold"" plan without paying extra. If you're healthy, something bad might still happen to you, but it might make more financial sense to take a gamble and buy a cheaper, high-deductible plan, rather than pay for extra protection you might not need. That plan will still protect you from really high bills, but you'd have to dig out several thousand dollars from your pocket first for a big emergency. For people with employer coverage, these plans are often called ""consumer-directed"" or ""H.S.A."" plans. In the Obamacare markets, they are called ""bronze."" Most insurance products — like car insurance or homeowner's insurance — aren't set up to pay for every last service. Instead, they are intended to protect you if something goes really wrong. Your car insurance doesn't pay for oil changes, but it does replace your car if it is totaled in a crash. Some people think about health insurance in the same way, as a protection from financial catastrophe. The Obamacare law makes every plan cover preventive health care like checkups, flu shots and mammograms at no charge. But, beyond that, plans that ask you to pay out of pocket for the first few visits and prescriptions tend to be cheaper than plans that have you pay a portion of every single bill. If you have savings or the ability to easily borrow some money, it often pays to buy a cheaper plan with a higher deductible. If you don't get sick, you'll save money. And if you do, you will have the financial cushion to pay a bigger share of health care costs that year. If you don't have any savings or the ability to borrow money, you might prefer to use insurance as a way to smooth out your costs over the year. Buying a more comprehensive plan will cost you more every month, but you might decide it's worth the extra money to avoid the financial consequences of an unexpected bill. Some of the least expensive plans in the Obamacare marketplace are plans that cover only a limited set of doctors and hospitals. The plans, called narrow networks, can be a good deal. But buying one may mean you have to give up a doctor you already know well, or you'll be steered away from a hospital you prefer because it is deemed too expensive to use. These are tough trade-offs, and different people will feel differently about what's important to them. If you have a lot of known health problems, and have strong relationships with doctors and hospitals, you will need to search through the plans' network listings to make sure you can continue to receive the care you want. The same goes if you have a particular set of medications. This may require some shoe-leather investigation, since the network directories are often confusing and out of date. If there are doctors you can't live without, call to make sure they are covered. You may be able to get a more affordable plan if you're willing to use a plan that covers a particular set of doctors and hospitals. Plans that do this are often called H.M.O.s or E.P.O.s — though other types of plans are also increasingly limiting their list of covered doctors. Even some people who don't currently have doctors might want to have a broad choice if they do get sick. Plans that allow patients to get coverage for so-called out-of network providers, generally called P.P.O.s, tend to be more expensive. Look at the plan summary to see what these plans will pay for a doctor who is ""out of network."" Ideally, health insurers would be competing on the basis of customer service, and not just price. But the experts I talked to said there's still no good way to compare the plans on the basis of quality. So, if you have found a plan that's a good deal, has a deductible you can afford and covers the doctors you care about, it's probably a solid choice. There's still a chance that you'll end up having to fill out annoying paperwork or get stuck on hold for hours to make an appointment. But that might have been true with another insurance company, too. ."
0,2016-11-03," TO get an idea of how annoying it can be to say ""O.K., Google"" multiple times a day, try replacing the word Google with another brand. O.K., Pepsi. O.K., Chipotle. O.K., Skittles. You get the picture. It's difficult to utter ""O.K., Google,"" the phrase used to control Google's new Home smart speaker, without sounding like a marketing tool. That is too bad because Google's Home is otherwise a preternaturally smarter speaker than its closest rival, Amazon's Echo. Google is releasing Home on Friday in the hope of riding the coattails of Echo, the Amazon gadget that is powered by the virtual assistant called Alexa. Echo became available last year to much fanfare. By posing questions and making requests to Alexa, people have since put Echo to work as a shopping assistant, kitchen companion and home automation tool. Amazon has a bona fide hardware hit. So Google created a similar smart speaker powered by the omniscient brains of Google search. To see how Home compares with Echo, I grilled both Alexa and Google side by side for six days. I tested the speakers in categories that they shared in common: music, trivia, dining, entertainment and the smart home. What I found was that while Echo is currently more capable than Home, partly because a larger number of third-party companies have worked with Amazon to add capabilities to its speaker, Google's product is poised to surpass Echo in the coming years. Home's link to Google's database of information means it will most likely be able to give superior answers in the future. In addition, music played from Home sounds clearer and its virtual assistant is a better listener than Alexa. So for those deciding between the two products, I recommend waiting to see if Home expands its abilities before making a purchase. All virtual assistants, which are backed by artificial intelligence, are still fairly dumb, including Google's Assistant, Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa and Microsoft's Cortana. But Google's Assistant is smarter than Alexa. Just give them both a pop quiz to see. A competent virtual assistant should be able to answer all sorts of arbitrary questions. Is Pluto a planet? Was Bill Murray in any TV shows? How do I build a bee trap? Amazon's Alexa was not able to answer those questions. But Google's Home speaker yanked an answer from its vast database of online search results. Pluto is a dwarf planet. Bill Murray was in ""Saturday Night Live."" And to make a bee catcher, you cut the top off a bottle, flip over the top and staple it inverted in the bottle. Amazon declined to comment. Occasionally there are times when Google gets stumped while Alexa succeeds. Asked who was ahead in the presidential polls, Google's Assistant had no answer. But Alexa said Hillary Clinton was polling at 45.1 percent and Donald J. Trump at 43.1 percent. Most of the time, however, Google has answers when Alexa fails. Why would Assistant not produce a response when the answers are out there from a quick Google search? Rishi Chandra, a vice president for product management at Google, said that when Google could confidently answer a question, Home would respond appropriately. But when it is less certain, it won't offer a guess. ""We don't want to presume an answer that may not be right,"" he said. ""We're being really cautious with this feature."" Google's speaker is called Home because of a vision that the gadget will work with many devices in someone's residence, be it a coffee maker or a garage door opener. Yet on Day 1, the speaker will work with products from only three smart home companies. Those include Nest, the thermostat maker owned by Google's parent company Alphabet; SmartThings, Samsung's smart home accessories maker; and Philips, which offers smart lighting systems called Hue. Missing from Home is support for smart home products from companies like Honeywell, TP-Link and LIFX, all of which are supported by Echo. With Home, I managed to get Google's Assistant to control my Hue smart lights. The setup was relatively easy but ran into some problems: The Home app detected four lights when I actually had two. I wasn't able to hook up my Honeywell smart thermostat or my TP-Link smart plug for controlling my coffee maker with Home because of Google's lack of support for the devices. Google said that for Home's release, it focused on getting Nest, SmartThings and Hue because they were the largest smart home companies on the market. More partnerships are to come. One major purpose of smart speakers is to play music and radio programs. Both speakers were good at serving tunes and radio programs from popular services and stations, but Home was superior. For playing music from my Spotify account, both Home and Echo were adept at playing songs from popular artists like Sia, Radiohead and Bon Iver. Home was generally better at understanding requests to play specific Spotify playlists or soundtracks. For example, asking the speakers to play the soundtrack for the film ""Drive"" resulted in Home playing the correct soundtrack, but Alexa played the album ""2014 Forest Hills Drive"" by J. Cole. For podcasts, both speakers were adequate — but again, Home was better. Alexa could play better-known podcasts like ""Fresh Air"" or ""Radio Lab,"" but it failed to play ""The Sporkful,"" a less popular podcast. Google could play just about any podcast I asked for. Google also came out ahead in this category because of sound quality. Both speakers sound good, but Home sounds louder and clearer, with deeper bass. In my tests, Home also did a better job taking requests while the speaker played loud music, whereas Alexa often seemed deaf. On the down side, Alexa and Home are fairly lacking when it comes to requests related to food and entertainment. The Google speaker does not have the capability to place orders for delivery food. Alexa can order a pizza from Domino's, but otherwise can't do much else for delivery orders. Neither speaker can book a table for a restaurant nearby. Still, both assistants excelled in detailing places to eat in the area. Asking them to find Chinese food nearby prompted them to list some local Chinese restaurants. Google did better here by also listing the street where the restaurants are. One task Alexa can pull off that Google can't is list showtimes for movies playing in the neighborhood. Mr. Chandra, the Google executive, said Home would add movie showtimes eventually. As for placing delivery orders, he said Google was working with other companies on designing an experience that works with voice — you wouldn't want a voice assistant listing 50 menu items, for instance. ""If you verbally spit out what's on the screen, then it's not going to work,"" he said. Echo and Home are largely the same in the basic tasks they can perform. The capabilities that Home currently lacks, like movie showtimes or support for other smart home accessories, will probably show up in software updates or future partnerships. So what really distinguishes one from the other? Right now, Echo's major advantage is its ability to order items from Amazon.com and its broader smart home capabilities. If you like the idea of using a speaker to quickly reorder diapers or toilet paper, or if you are eager to get a speaker to control home accessories like lights and thermostats, Echo is a better product for you. But if you aren't big on Amazon shopping and can wait a few months to see how Home evolves, Google's speaker may be your long-term bet because of its smarter artificial intelligence and superior audio player. Home, priced at about $130, is also cheaper than Amazon's $180 Echo. Let's just hope Google eventually gives people more ways to talk to its speaker other than ""O.K., Google."" (The only other option is ""Hey, Google."") It gets so tedious that you may eventually say, ""O.K., I'm over this."""
1,2016-11-03," Gadget geeks will get their chance to size up a new toy at the end of this week when Google brings out Home, its voice-activated smart speaker powered by a virtual assistant. If that sounds familiar, that's because the new gadget, which can play music and respond to questions people ask it, bears something of a resemblance to Amazon's Echo, which is — you guessed it — a voice-activated smart speaker powered by a virtual assistant. Echo, whose virtual assistant is called Alexa, has been a hit with consumers since it became available last year. Google has been hyping Home for quite a few months. The search giant, which now looks late to the smart-speaker market compared with Amazon, has a lot riding on Home, including its reputation for inventiveness and its prowess around artificial intelligence. Home is also the second new hardware device from Google in two months; the company released Pixel, a new smartphone, in October. Brian X. Chen, the New York Times's personal technology writer, recently took Home for a spin and compared it with Amazon's Echo. His verdict: Home delivers as a smart speaker, with an ability to answer all manner of user questions, as well as strong sound qualities for playing music. Read more about his results here."
0,2016-11-05," Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week's news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Mike: Good morrow, Sir Farhad. How doth thou feelest this faire morning? Do you like the way I'm talking? I'm really into this video game where I'm a witch hunter in like the 1400s and have to speak to everyone like this. Then I hack up scary monsters with my sword and cool potions. It's very much like my real life. Farhad: It's interesting that you mention that. To distract myself from this crazy election, I've been playing Mario games on my kids' Nintendo Wii. But I guess I'm still not in a good mood, because I started getting annoyed that Princess Peach keeps getting herself kidnapped. She seems pretty careless, if you ask me. Mike: Right, onward toward our voyage into thee wild beasts and demons of technology! So on Halloween, a new streaming video Q. and A. app called Whale was released, winning over the hearts and minds of at least one tech blog in Silicon Valley. ""Whale"" makes me immediately think of Twitter's faulty ""fail whale,"" so I'm not sure about the whole branding issue here. But it was built by this guy Justin Kan, who's basically been doing (and making big bucks off) live video stuff on and off for years. So, we'll see. Speaking of live video, the Vine guys are back with another video app called Hype. It, too, focuses on live streaming video, and apparently incorporates some other stuff. I'm sensing a theme here. Call me old, or something, but it's starting to bore me. Maybe my life isn't cool enough to broadcast live all the time. Farhad: I haven't heard of Hype (ironically), but someone did send me a Whale message the other day, so I checked it out. It actually seemed pretty interesting. Lots of people have tried to build question-answering apps over the last few years, but I haven't seen a video-based service before, and that could be a compelling twist. Imagine the hordes that would pay to see us answer questions about how to succeed in life? Mike: Now that right there is irony. Onto some other stuff. Instagram debuted some commerce features on its platform, which basically turn some photos into pages that allow users to pick out and buy stuff they see. The guy in charge of the project told me he thinks of it a lot like a catalog you and I may browse but, uh, for your phone. All I know is, if it shows me anything like the weird gadgets they have in SkyMall, I'm down. Farhad: This seemed like a big deal to me. I think of Instagram and Pinterest (which also has a version of this feature) as the digital evolution of glossy fashion magazines — people scroll through them for ideas and inspiration, which means they're often primed to buy stuff. I've argued before that Amazon's dominance means there isn't much room online anymore to create new e-commerce businesses, but one thing Amazon doesn't do well is give you ideas for things you might want but don't know about yet. Instagram could fill that hole, I think. I mean, if you saw a robotic jar opener in your feed, wouldn't you buy it? I would! Mike: The one time I tried to actually buy something from an Instagram ad, some concert tickets, they had already sold out. Huge bummer. Oh, something else to note. Facebook is still a moneymaking machine, crushing Wall Street estimates yet again with its quarterly earnings this week. What's most mind-blowing to me is that they continue to grow ever larger, nearly at 1.8 billion monthly users to date, despite being totally ginormous already. Imagine that: Already serving one fourth of the world and still growing like a weed. I truly don't understand how that happens. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, told me it was because they have a ""great product"" which, uh, simplifies things a bit. I really want to know the secret sauce. But what goes up must come down, and analysts are freaked out about Facebook reaching the limits of ""ad load,"" or how many ads they can jam into the News Feed over time. Which, I think, is a reasonable concern if your main worry is how Facebook is going to keep making more and more money. A rather base concern to me, but hey, I don't work on Wall Street. Farhad: Yeah, I was a bit surprised by Wall Street's reaction to the news that so many people are using a single product so often. It's evidence of finance guys' short-termism. Sure, in the next few years, it's possible Facebook's ad business may not grow as fast as it's been growing. But getting that many people hooked is an incredible foundation on which to build all kinds of new products and other ways to make money. If your product is a daily addiction for nearly two billion people, how can you lose? Mike: Right. So let's talk about something incredibly boring yet surprisingly important: Collaboration! This week, the world's least threatening war was waged between Microsoft and Slack, which now offer two competing enterprise workplace collaboration products. Good Lord, I almost fell asleep saying that. Farhad: Wait a minute, I think part of the reason you're putting us all to sleep is you're calling them ""workplace collaboration products."" Aren't they just group messaging apps? Basically, you see your co-workers in a chat room and send them funny messages and GIFs all day. Mike: I'm pretty sure our co-workers hate that we use it like that. Farhad: Also, Slack offers deep integrations with third-party apps, allowing you to control all kinds of other workplace software (like your expense reporting or customer service tools) through your messaging app. That's what we're talking about. Mike: Yes, O.K., fine. It can do all that stuff, and Slack loves to tout it. But at least one of the primary aims, as I see it, is to eventually kill off email as the primary way of how we communicate with one another internally. Which is a noble goal, in this age of reply-all disasters. So it's a bit snoozy, but it's key to the future of how we work. As more of us telecommute and forgo regular trips to the office — I'm writing this on the floor of my apartment right now! — we're growing increasingly reliant on services like Slack (or Microsoft Teams) to stay in communication with our co-workers. You and I do most of our private chatting on Slack when we're not tweeting. Or, you know, talk about ""Game of Thrones"" with other co-workers. So the conceit is, perhaps one or a handful of companies will be responsible for providing the connective tissue that serves us all in our nifty workplaces of the future. Slack, so far, has been doing a good job where many others like Yammer, a Microsoft-owned product, mind you, have so miserably failed in the past. Now, Microsoft wants another crack at the problem, and is using its incredible distribution clout with Microsoft Office to give its new product away to paying subscribers. Slack is probably freaking out, as was slightly evident by the full-page ad they put out in The Times this week. (Our business side thanks you for the $$$, Slack!) What say you about collaboration? Isn't this incredibly important to you? Farhad: Yeah, I think these could be a big deal, and I think Microsoft is wise to enter this area. Slack is doing very well. Companies keep signing up for it, and as they start recognizing how terrible email has become (thanks, Hillary!), I suspect more will turn to chat apps. And Microsoft has a real shot here. Slack has momentum, but Microsoft has a huge sales staff and deep connections with I.T. staff at businesses across the world. In its full-page ad, Slack confessed to being a little bit scared of Microsoft's big push. I think it should be. Also, are you going to join my Microsoft Team? Mike: Yes, but only if we use it as a gaming chat room, too. To the battlefield, Sir Farhad!"
0,2016-11-14," Q. I have an analog television in the kitchen that predates the digital HDTV revolution. I'd like to attach an inexpensive streaming device like the Amazon Fire TV Stick to it, but the specifications say an HDMI port is required. Am I out of luck? A. Most streaming video devices that connect to your television need an HDMI port and the wide-screen rectangular aspect ratio for the best performance. However, you can get a special converter that lets you use the Amazon Fire TV Stick with older sets — like those with screens in the 4:3 aspect ratio and the yellow, red and white composite jacks for connecting video devices to the television. These converters typically cost around $40 to $70 and can be found online. Cirago's HDMI to AV Composite Converter is one such product; the Bleiden company makes several adapters for connecting an older television to the Amazon Fire TV Stick, the Google Chromecast, the Apple TV, the Roku Streaming Stick or at least two of Roku's set-top boxes. Keep in mind that the video picture on the older television will be in standard definition (not the high-definition image an HDTV can show). Some converters and TV models may not work together well and have difficulty displaying the picture properly or playing copyrighted content. Customer reviews on product pages or comments on video forums may give you an idea of how well a certain converter may do with a specific TV model. While Amazon's Fire TV products, Apple TV and Google Chromecast all require an HDMI connection, Roku has one device in its line of streaming TV hardware that does not require an extra converter. Of the company's seven streaming products, (including the $130 Roku Ultra with 4K and HDR picture quality and a series of Roku-equipped television sets), the $40 Roku Express Plus model works with either composite or HDMI connections."
0,2016-11-17," Target's bull's-eye will be hard to repeat. After a big miss over the summer, the American retailer improved its marksmanship with an impressive jump in online sales and raised its 2016 profit forecast. Even so, Target needs more customers wandering its aisles over the holiday season and a sustainable plan to compete with Amazon. By most accounts, Target turned things around in its latest quarter. Although overall revenue tumbled nearly 7 percent for the three months ending Oct. 29, to $16 billion, the company surpassed profit and sales forecasts. More high-margin apparel, home and baby items flew off the shelves. E-commerce revenue also grew a healthy 26 percent. The results, which sent Target shares up almost 7 percent on Wednesday, represent a stark turnaround from the previous quarter, when the company blamed a drop in demand for Apple iPhones and such for its weakness. A rocky grocery business and management shake-ups augured more challenges. In August, it cut its full-year earnings expectations. This latest improvement may be short-lived, however. The retailer's chief executive, Brian Cornell, was peppier about the final months of the year but not especially cheery. Target expects comparable-store sales to be flat this quarter. Restoring growth in foot traffic is a priority. Marketing its more than 1,000 retail locations as pickup destinations for online orders can help. So, too, should opening stores in cities like New York. Amazon's product breadth and ever-speedier home delivery are formidable, however. Walmart also is plowing headlong into digital with the recent $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com. Trading at just 13 times earnings, below many of its peers, could make Target a mark for investors. It is just not clear yet whether the company can maintain a steady aim."

1,2016-11-18," MACAPÁ, Brazil — The pirates of the Amazon River relish striking after nightfall. Wearing balaclavas, 15 of the marauders stormed Merinaldo Paiva's riverboat as dozens of his passengers dozed in their hammocks. Suddenly, they woke to find rifles pointed at their heads. The gunmen took cash, jewelry, smartphones, fuel and even food, forcing everyone to lie facedown on the deck. Then they disappeared on speedboats into the Amazon, a waterway so vast that some in Brazil's frontier call it the river-sea. ""Every riverboat captain knows they're at the mercy of these bastards,"" said the captain, Mr. Paiva, 41, who has been plying the rivers of Brazil's rain forests since he was a teenager. ""We're lucky it wasn't worse,"" he added of the robbery in April, listing other attacks in which passengers had been raped, tortured or killed. Piracy has long been a fact of life on the rivers of Brazil's anarchic wilderness. But as the population in the Amazon surges and drug gangs expand their sway over the region, hijacking opportunities have flourished. And police forces are struggling to keep up with the crime, culminating in a series of recent attacks that have terrorized riverboat crews and their passengers. In October, four masked pirates with rifles took over a fuel ship on the Solimões River and stole more than 2,600 gallons of diesel fuel, along with the cash, watches and clothing of the crew. In September, 10 masked men stormed a passenger ship near the city of Belém, robbing 260 passengers at once. The attackers used one woman aboard as a human shield during the ordeal. The month before, the police released a video of men from one crew — the self-described Pirates of the Solimões River — interrogating a rival gangster next to a dead body, putting riverbank dwellers on edge throughout the Amazon Basin. In a previous case near the city of Manaus, Huederson Paulino, a pirate who used the nom de guerre Mohican, confessed to killing and dismembering two men on a boat selling ice and salt. He led a gang that stole cash and fuel from the victims, and said his aim was to get spending money for Christmas. ""I needed the money, so I did what was best for me,"" Mr. Paulino, 24, told reporters. The growing alarm over piracy dovetails with rapid changes in the region. Far from an empty expanse of rain forest dotted by tiny outposts, the Brazilian Amazon has nearly 25 million people, with about two million in Manaus alone. The region's population surged 22 percent from 2000 to 2010, according to census figures — nearly double the rate of the country as a whole. But the Amazon is also one of the poorest parts of Brazil, and organized crime has spread, feeding a sense of lawlessness in the vast river basin. In remote riverbank villages, residents complain that police boats rarely venture into the waterways where many of the pirate attacks take place. The authorities say they are trying. Here in Macapá, a city of 370,000 in northern Brazil, an elite squad of camouflage-clad police officers from the Environmental Battalion regularly patrol the Amazon River for pirates, often called water rats in local parlance. ""Just as highwaymen prey on road travelers elsewhere in Brazil, pirates are the scourge we face here in the Amazon,"" said Lt. Col. Protásio Barriga Caldas, 47, the commander of Amapá State's 135-member Environmental Battalion. Robbers have stalked these waterways for years. In one notorious case, pirates fatally shot Sir Peter Blake, the world champion yachtsman from New Zealand, in 2001. The gunmen boarded his vessel, the Seamaster, and robbed and attacked the crew. Mr. Blake managed to shoot one of the assailants in the hand, but died after being shot in the lung and heart. These days, with more targets on the rivers and more criminal groups involved, riverboat operators warn that the pirates are growing even more ruthless and sophisticated. In one case this year, the police in Amazonas State captured José Conceição de Souza, a pirate who confessed to killing two Colombian drug traffickers and stealing 573 pounds of cocaine the traffickers were taking by boat to Manaus. Galdino Alencar, the president of the Union of River Navigation Companies of Amazonas State, said that pirates were increasingly targeting ships carrying large cargoes for the growing population of the Amazon, including cooking gas, electronic devices, cement and dried beef. But the most coveted cargo for pirates, he said, is fuel. ""It's a product they can steal and go on to sell to gold miners operating illegally in the forest,"" Mr. Alencar said. He added that pirates were also stepping up attacks on ships docked in large cities like Manaus, spurring calls by his organization to create a federal river police force. Colonel Caldas said the pirates usually traveled on speedboats, giving them a quickness and agility that bulkier riverboats lack. He added that they often came from impoverished urban areas or far-flung riverbank villages, and preyed on forest dwellers who rely on riverboats to purchase food, visit relatives or obtain medical care in Amazon cities. Patrolling the Amazon's colossal rivers for pirates can resemble a futile game of cat-and-mouse. On one river mission in October, police officers questioned residents of a settlement near the Port of Santana who described living in constant fear of pirates. ""There's no law on the Amazon River,"" said Odete Souza França, 49, whose family makes its living by fishing and cultivating açaí, the coveted purple fruit that is a staple here. She described a recent attack in which pirates boarded the canoe of her 17-year-old son, tied him up, and stole his GPS device and a cylinder of cooking gas. Catching such culprits involves immense challenges. To start with, the rivers of the Amazon Basin course through a region almost the size of the contiguous United States. Ships on the main waterways can go days without seeing the police or navy boats. Pirates often know the rivers and surrounding terrain better than security forces, and can drop out of sight into far-flung villages. Police officers here in Amapá State also complain that pirates often carry out their attacks in one state, only to dart over the border into a neighboring one with a different jurisdiction. ""Catching pirates is like waging war against guerrilla fighters,"" said Capt. Lúcio Lima, the chief of a special operations unit of the Amapá police force that hunts down river bandits. ""They are elusive foes who make the most of their knowledge of river currents, geography and topography."" When two Polish explorers — Dawid Andres, 41, and Hubert Kisinski, 33 — traveled the length of the Amazon River this year on pontoons outfitted with mountain bikes, they faced challenges from piranha-infested waters to whirlpools. Still, they said their scariest moments came when pirates in Brazil approached them on three occasions. Each time, they said, they were able to talk their way out of daunting situations. ""It's the stuff of a nightmare when a crew in Ray-Bans holding huge guns approaches you on the river,"" Mr. Kisinski said. Recalling one episode, he said that he and Mr. Andres had calmly explained that they were traveling without valuable items, and then asked the pirates if they had any beer to relieve the stress of the situation. ""That calmed them down a bit; they even started to laugh,"" Mr. Kisinski said. ""One needs to keep a clear head when facing pirates in the Amazon."""

0,2016-11-20," Three days after the presidential election, an astute law professor tweeted a picture of three paragraphs, very slightly condensed, from Richard Rorty's ""Achieving Our Country,"" published in 1998. It was retweeted thousands of times, generating a run on the book — its ranking soared on Amazon and by day's end it was no longer available. (Harvard University Press is reprinting the book for the first time since 2010, a spokeswoman for the publisher said.) It's worth rereading those tweeted paragraphs: Mr. Rorty, an American pragmatist philosopher, died in 2007. Were he still alive, he'd likely be deluged with phone calls from strangers, begging him to pick their stocks. When ""Achieving Our Country"" came out, it received a mixed critical reception. Writing for this newspaper, the critic Christopher Lehmann-Haupt called the book ""philosophically rigorous"" but took umbrage at Mr. Rorty's warnings about the country's vulnerability to the charms of a strongman, calling this prophesy ""a form of intellectual bullying."" Donald J. Trump enthusiasts might dispute the word strongman. But the essence of Mr. Rorty's argument holds up surprisingly well. Where others saw positive trends — say, a full-throated dawn chorus praising the nation's diversity — Mr. Rorty saw dead canaries in a coal mine. His basic contention is that the left once upon a time believed that our country, for all its flaws, was both perfectible and worth perfecting. Hope was part of its core philosophy. But during the 1960s, shame — over Vietnam, over the serial humiliation of African-Americans — transformed a good portion of the left, at least the academic left, into a disaffected gang of spectators, rather than agitators for change. A formalized despair became its philosophy. The system was beyond reform. The best one could do was focus on its victims. The result was disastrous. The alliance between the unions and intellectuals, so vital to passing legislation in the Progressive Era, broke down. In universities, cultural and identity politics replaced the politics of change and economic justice. By 1997, when Mr. Rorty gave three lectures that make up the spine of ""Achieving Our Country,"" few of his academic colleagues, he insisted, were talking about reducing poverty at all. ""Nobody is setting up a program in unemployed studies, homeless studies, or trailer-park studies,"" he wrote, ""because the unemployed, the homeless, and the residents of trailer parks are not 'other' in the relevant sense."" Does this overlooked category sound familiar? Mr. Rorty did not deny that identity politics reduced the suffering of minorities. But it just so happened that at the very moment ""socially accepted sadism"" — good phrase, that — was diminishing, economic instability and inequality were increasing, thanks to globalization. ""This world economy will soon be owned by a cosmopolitan upper class which has no more sense of community with any workers anywhere than the great American capitalists of the year 1900."" Again: Ring any bells? This group included intellectuals, by the way, who, he wrote, are ""ourselves quite well insulated, at least in the short run, from the effects of globalization."" Which left the white working-class guy and gal up for grabs — open to right-wing populists, maybe even strongmen. In Mr. Rorty's view, no one within academia was thinking creatively about how to relieve white working-class anxiety. This was a problem. ""Outside the academy,"" he wrote, ""Americans still want to feel patriotic. They still want to feel part of a nation which can take control of its destiny and make itself a better place."" Sounds an awful lot like Make America Great Again. At the time, Mr. Rorty was staring at a slightly different political landscape. But it wasn't that different, ultimately. Today's just has more mature trees. In ""Achieving Our Country,"" he wrote about the perils of the North American Free Trade Agreement; today, he'd probably have cautioned against the Trans-Pacific Partnership. In ""Achieving Our Country,"" Mr. Rorty railed against the ""scurrilous demagogue"" Pat Buchanan, who in 1991 talked about building a fence at the Mexican border; today Mr. Rorty would have railed against Mr. Trump and his proposed wall. ""Why could not the left,"" he asked, ""channel the mounting rage of the newly dispossessed?"" Is his analysis a bit oversimple? Yes. Even within universities, there have always been optimistic champions of America, those who ever-passionately believe in the moral arc bending toward justice and work ever-diligently on formulating concrete, actionable policies that would make the country more just. By focusing only on his own environment, academia, Mr. Rorty's arguments also seem strangely parochial. During the 1960s, the academic left may have started to turn its back on poverty, but actual politicians on the left were still thinking a great deal about it: Robert F. Kennedy was visiting poor white families in Appalachia; Lyndon B. Johnson was building the Great Society. Right through the '90s and into the 2000s, we had left-of-center politicians singing the praises of hope, rather than the hopelessness that Mr. Rorty decries. Bill Clinton explicitly campaigned as the ""man from Hope,"" and Barack Obama would later campaign on a platform of ""hope"" and ""change."" In passing health care reform, Mr. Obama genuinely did something for the immiserated underclass, and both men, in their ways, rejected identity politics. (Remember Mr. Clinton dressing down Sister Souljah? Or Mr. Obama declaring on MTV that ""brothers should pull up their pants""?) But it wasn't enough, obviously. ""Under Presidents Carter and Clinton,"" Mr. Rorty wrote, ""the Democratic Party has survived by distancing itself from the unions and from any mention of redistribution."" Mr. Clinton was particularly guilty of this charge, passing Nafta, appointing Robert Rubin as his Treasury secretary and enthusiastically embracing financial deregulation. Mr. Obama pushed the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And he was one of those fancy elites. Which brings us to Hillary Clinton. She may have had a plan to relieve the misery of the working class, but she didn't speak about it much. (Bernie Sanders did. And lost.) She was in favor of the Partnership until she was against it. In a paid speech to a Brazilian bank, she spoke of a ""hemispheric common market"" for energy. And though her slogan was ""Stronger Together,"" her campaign was ultimately predicated on celebrating difference, in the hope that disparate voting blocs would come out and vote for her. Here, Mr. Rorty's most inflammatory words are most relevant, and also most uncomfortable: ""The cultural Left has a vision of an America in which the white patriarchs have stopped voting and have left all the voting to be done by members of previously victimized groups."" Mrs. Clinton tried this strategy. It didn't win her the Electoral College. ""This Left wants to preserve otherness rather than ignore it,"" he also wrote. That didn't work either. People are furiously arguing about what played a key role in this election — whether it was white working-class despair, a racist backlash or terror about the pace of cultural change. It seems reasonable to think that all three played a part. What's so striking about ""Achieving Our Country"" is that it blends these theories into a common argument: The left, both cultural and political, eventually abandoned economic justice in favor of identity politics, leaving too many people feeling freaked out or ignored. ""It is as if the American Left could not handle more than one initiative at a time,"" Mr. Rorty wrote. ""As if it either had to ignore stigma in order to concentrate on money, or vice versa."" You may quarrel with his argument; you may say that he was projecting onto the larger world what was happening within his own cloistered, ivied walls. But Mr. Trump is now our president-elect."
0,2016-11-21," The thundering waves of the Pororoca were legendary: Adventurers from the world over flew, drove, trekked, Jet-Skied and canoed to Brazil's remote Araguari River to ride the Amazon's stunning tidal bore that formed when water flowed in from the Atlantic. But the exhilarating waves that once reached five feet high are gone now, squelched by man-made factors, such as the large-scale ranching of Asian water buffaloes, an invasive species introduced to the Amazon decades ago, and new hydroelectric dams built along the Araguari. Brazilian surfers are expressing anguish about the end of the Pororoca (which means ""mighty noise"" in the indigenous Tupi language) on the river, in the state of Amapá in northern Brazil. ""The Pororoca in Amapá was the best in the world,"" said Serginho Laus, 36, a professional surfer who has pioneered trips to Amapá and set a record in 2003 for surfing nonstop for 6.3 miles. ""Now it's a warning of how man's actions can change our rivers forever."" Surfers rode the last Pororoca on the Araguari River in 2013. Some blame the buffaloes: For years, ranchers have opened canals from the river to slake their herds' thirst, while the buffaloes themselves trampled around the banks of the Araguari, depleting the river's flow, according to environmental activists. The ranchers say two dams diminished the Araguari's strength. Either way, the end of what was considered the Amazon's mightiest Pororoca is a bummer lamented on national newscasts. Some optimists point out that the conditions persist for creating tidal bores, albeit of lesser intensity. When the sun crosses the Equator during equinoxes in September and March, the gravitational and lunar conditions bolster tidal bores as the flow of other rivers around the Amazon is reversed. Mr. Laus, for one, says that Papua New Guinea and India guard their own great tidal bores. Closer to home, he is scouring the Amazon for other sites with potential."

0,2016-11-23," SEATTLE — A federal judge on Wednesday ordered striking airline cargo pilots who transport packages for Amazon and other customers to immediately resume work. About 250 pilots for the carrier, ABX Air, went on strike on Tuesday, accusing their employer of forcing them to work an excessive number of flight assignments in violation of their contract. The strike threatened to hold up shipments of Amazon orders, though the internet retailer said it had avoided delays so far. In a hearing Wednesday evening in Cincinnati, Federal District Court Judge Timothy S. Black granted ABX Air a temporary restraining order blocking the strike, according to representatives of the company and pilots' union. The Airline Professionals Association, Teamsters Local 1224, the union representing the pilots, started the strike because of what it called significant understaffing problems at ABX Air, which has demanded that pilots fly ""emergency"" flights to meet the demands of its cargo customers, disrupting the pilots' schedules. The pilots were picketing outside ABX headquarters in Wilmington, Ohio, and Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, where DHL, one of ABX's big customers, has its North American hub. In a statement, the union said its pilots would return to work, but called on ABX to address the staffing shortages that prompted the strike. ""ABX Air's failure to address the staffing crisis hurts our families and compromises our ability to do our jobs and meet the needs of Amazon, DHL and other customers,"" said Rick Ziebarth, an ABX pilot and a representative of the pilots' union. Amazon has significantly expanded the number of jets it leases from carriers like ABX over the last year to meet soaring demand from customers for speedy shipment of their orders. This year, Amazon and the Air Transport Services Group, the parent company of ABX, announced that Amazon was leasing 20 Boeing 767 freighter aircraft to ensure that the retailer had enough capacity to ship one- and two-day deliveries for customers. As part of their agreement, the carrier granted Amazon warrants to buy just under 20 percent of its stock over a five-year period. Amazon suggested that so far, the strike had not affected its customers. ""We rebalanced capacity across our diverse network of carrier partners, and these adjustments ensure there are no disruptions through the busy holiday weekend,"" Kelly Cheeseman, an Amazon spokeswoman, said. ABX said it expected flights to resume immediately. ""I am pleased that the court continues to recognize the value to all parties from continuing to work out remaining differences in negotiations and through arbitration,"" John Starkovich, president of ABX Air, said in a statement. Amazon has gone to great lengths to discourage employees in its warehouses across the country from forming unions, arguing that they would interfere with the company's ability to innovate inside the facilities. But the strike by the pilots shows how some segments of its logistics network could still be affected by organized labor. In a phone interview before the judge's ruling, Mr. Ziebarth, the ABX pilot and union representative, said that the scheduling demands of his employer had caused considerable strain among pilots, which could become worse as the carrier and its customers head into the peak holiday shopping season. ""I can't tell you how many birthdays, family events, anniversaries and even funerals our pilots have had to miss because of all these emergency flights,"" he said."

0,2016-11-27," Chico Mendes was hard to kill. No one knew that better than his enemies in Brazil's Amazon rain forest. They had failed in half a dozen assassination attempts. But on a December night in 1988, Mr. Mendes's luck ran out. A shotgun blast ripped into him as he stepped outside his wood-frame house in the western Brazilian state of Acre. It was the end of a man who had won global acclaim for championing the sanctity of the forest and the rights of compatriots who eked out a living by extracting latex from rubber trees. Retro Report, a series of video documentaries that explore the enduring impact of major news events of the past, harks back to the eco-martyrdom of Francisco Alves Mendes Filho: Chico to everyone. More broadly, this episode looks at the perilous state of tropical forests — notably the Amazon, the biggest of all at 2.1 million square miles — and the threat that persists for indigenous peoples and for the environmental balance of the planet. Over the last half-century, roughly 20 percent of the Brazilian Amazon has disappeared as a result of deliberately set fires and relentless bulldozing to make room for cattle ranchers and to clear paths for loggers, road builders and other developers. Mindful of the international outcry over looming ecological disaster, Brazil has tried to slow the pace of this deforestation, with a commitment to bring it down to zero by 2030. But steady progress has proved elusive; of late, there has been some backsliding. Environmentalists warn that in another 15 years or so, little of the rain forest may be left to be saved. The Amazon, nearly two-thirds of which lies in Brazil, is often described as the world's lungs because of the carbon dioxide it absorbs from the atmosphere and the oxygen it pumps back out. Cutting down trees, not to mention burning them, upsets the normal process. And Brazil is not the lone concern. Indonesia, the journal Nature wrote last year, ""is clearing more forest than any other country."" By some estimates, deforestation worldwide accounts for about 15 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Mr. Mendes's death at age 44 became a turning point in Brazil's environmental consciousness. Unable to read until he was 18, he started out as just another guy trying to get by. He worked as a rubber tapper, one of many in the Amazon who cut into trees and collect the latex oozing from the incisions. The methods are a circumspect intrusion on nature, allowing for constant renewal. Deforestation threatened the rubber tappers' livelihood. With his social conscience aroused, Mr. Mendes helped unionize them. He organized resistance in the form of human chains that blocked developers' incursions into the forests. Eventually, he came to appreciate that saving the Amazon was a blessing not only for his workers but also for the world. But while international environmental groups lauded him, Brazilian cattle raisers and others with a financial stake wanted him out of the way. ""He was to the ranchers of the Amazon what Cesar Chavez was to the citrus kings of California, what Lech Walesa was to the shipyard managers of Gdansk,"" Andrew C. Revkin, who long covered environment issues for The New York Times, wrote in ""The Burning Season,"" his 1990 book on Mr. Mendes's life and death. Murder in the Amazon was hardly unfamiliar. Across a quarter-century before the Mendes shooting, 982 environmental activists were killed in land disputes, the Roman Catholic Church in Brazil said. Most died at the hands of ranchers' hired guns. The killers brought to justice could be counted on one hand. Mr. Mendes, though, did not become just another statistic. His murderers — father and son ranchers — were found guilty and sentenced in 1990 to 19-year prison terms. In the aftermath, a movement to save the Amazon gained impetus. Brazil's leaders now saw merit in putting the brakes on deforestation. They created preserves in the Amazon basin, with moratoriums on tree-clearing. (One preserve, covering 3,750 square miles, nearly the size of Delaware and Rhode Island combined, was named for Mr. Mendes). Law enforcement officials cracked down on rogue ranchers, loggers and land speculators. Plans were halted for a dam that would have flooded territory occupied by the Kayapó tribe. International businesses stepped up as well. Several large beef producers agreed to boycott ranchers whose herds grazed on denuded stretches of the Amazon. Giants like Nike and Gucci, perhaps reacting to customer pressure, agreed to have nothing to do with leather from razed sections of the forest. By the early 2010s, the rate of Amazon deforestation was one-fourth what it had been a decade earlier. It was part of a worldwide trend. In 2015, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations reported that across the planet, 129 million hectares of forest — nearly 500,000 square miles, an area roughly equivalent to that of South Africa — had disappeared since 1990. Nonetheless, the agency said, the annual rate of loss had slowed appreciably as forest management improved. Staying the course has proved difficult, in part because Brazil landed on hard times and has re-emphasized economic development. Recurring turmoil, including the impeachment and removal of President Dilma Rousseff in August, raises questions about the political will to pursue environmentally friendly policies. Forest burn rates spiked in 2013 and again in 2015; preliminary data for the first half of this year suggest that the trend continues. The dam project opposed by the Kayapó sprung back to life, going into operation this year. Gold mining expanded. Officialdom relaxed rules that limited deforestation and reduced the percentage of the Amazon required to be preserved. Cattle ranchers found guilty of unlawfully clearing trees were granted amnesty. As for murders of environmental activists, they never stopped. One prominent victim among many hundreds was Sister Dorothy Stang, a 73-year-old American nun shot to death in 2005 by ranchers' gunslingers. Brazil is not alone in this drumbeat of death. Global Witness, a watchdog group based in London, reported 185 such killings around the world in 2015, an average of one every other day. Those were just the killings that could be documented; the true toll, the organization said, was probably much higher. Latin America is singularly hazardous for activists. Brazil had 50 such killings last year. Colombia had 26, Peru and Nicaragua 12 each, Guatemala 10 and Honduras eight. On the other side of the globe, the Philippines had 33. These setbacks notwithstanding, many Brazilian ranchers seem to grasp the importance of sustainability. Steve Schwartzman, who is in charge of tropical forest policy for the Environmental Defense Fund, told Retro Report that ""a basic insight, which goes back to Chico Mendes, has become commonplace — to make standing forest a real economic asset that benefits the people that are living in it and that creates real growth without environmental disruption."" Mr. Mendes understood it decades ago. ""At first I thought I was fighting to save rubber trees,"" he said a year before his death. ""Then I thought I was fighting to save the Amazon rain forest. Now I realize I am fighting for humanity."""
0,2016-11-28," I was happy to see this fresh Retro Report production on the legacy of Chico Mendes, the Brazilian rain forest defender who was slain by a ranching family in December, 1988 as land conflicts followed road building in the depths of the Amazon. Retro Report is an innovative journalism project revisiting stories long after the headlines have flowed by. The resulting videos provide an invaluable learning tool for students of all ages interested in media cycles and keeping an eye on what's real. As I wrote a few days ago, such efforts are more important than ever given the fact-free nature of so much online discourse. Please watch the video above and read the related story in The Times by Clyde Haberman. [Steve Schwartzman, an anthropologist who worked closely with Mendes and has spent decades working in the Amazon and other forest regions for the Environmental Defense Fund, analyzes what has and hasn't changed in Brazil's rain forests.] Haberman notes that while violence in the Amazon has ebbed somewhat, murderous attacks on Indians and others still occur there and have spread to forest frontiers around the world — a troubling reality that I've tried to track here through the years. For more, listen to the Takeaway radio segment posted by WNYC featuring the producer of this report, Geoffrey O'Connor, a filmmaker who was in the Amazon through the violent stretch when Mendes was assassinated. For a long read on Mendes's life and the broader events in the Amazon in recent decades, I have to recommend ""The Burning Season,"" my first book, which shows how this remarkable man displayed extraordinary adaptability and creativity in fighting deforestation — defying the many stereotypes that outsiders tried to apply.

0,2016-11-29," Q. I got an email from Amazon for something I didn't order. Should I be worried my account has been compromised? So far, nothing has happened. A. As with other large organizations like the Internal Revenue Service or financial companies, online thieves have created fraudulent Amazon names to try to fool people into divulging account passwords and other personal information. These phishing messages typically prey on common account-security fears, like someone ordering things and charging them to your credit card, notices of your password being changed or requests for you to update your payment information because of suspicious activity. Some phishing messages immediately give themselves away as bogus through bad grammar, typographical errors, a spoofed return address or other incorrect information. If you can easily spot it as a fake, report it to the company by forwarding the whole message as an attachment to stop-spoofing@amazon.com. As with other out-of-the-blue account notices you may get, do not click links in the message or open any attached files, even if it looks legitimate. If you are concerned about your account security or merchandise orders you may have forgotten, go directly to the Amazon site and log on under the Your Account menu at the top of the page. On the Your Account page, you can see a list of your past and pending purchases in the Your Orders menu — in case there is one you forgot. The Your Account page serves as a dashboard for all your Amazon account settings, so you can also change your password for the site in the Login & Security Settings. With the holiday gift-giving season in full swing now, expect to see more of these phishing messages. Amazon has its own guide to dealing with the problem and a page of tips to help avoid payment fraud."
0,2016-12-01," The executives at Snap, the parent company of the messaging app Snapchat, like to make a point of noting they do not run a Silicon Valley company. But what exactly does that mean? Let's start with geography. Unlike nearly every other big social media service, Snapchat is not based in Silicon Valley or San Francisco. (To be clear, the city on the end of the peninsula is not part of Silicon Valley, despite lazy writing efforts that say otherwise.) Rather, Snapchat is in the Venice neighborhood of Los Angeles. Snapchat's Southern California home means it's a little closer to Hollywood. It also means it's not as steeped in the Valley's notion that the computer algorithm always knows what's best. As Farhad Manjoo writes, Snapchat has quietly changed how people perceive social networks. Its users aren't as obsessed with going viral, amassing friends or putting on a show. Instead, they're sharing real moments and, incredibly, adding a human element to editing and news curation. As Farhad notes, adults are generally missing this shift because of Snapchat's young audience. But they shouldn't dismiss it. With a public offering expected in the coming months, we're learn more about how this company works and what its executives hope it can be in the coming years. Amazon aside, not being in Silicon Valley — or San Francisco! — has rarely been a benefit to an American internet company. Remember CMGI, the internet conglomerate in Massachusetts? Of course, you don't. Even the people who worked there probably don't. And don't forget the attempt by Terry Semel, when he was the C.E.O. of Yahoo (that's several Yahoo C.E.O.s ago), to inject a little Hollywood pizazz into the long, long troubled internet company by opening a major office in Santa Monica, Calif. The pizazz did not take hold. The entire country will rejoice if another internet company can show that you don't have to be in the Bay Area to become an industry giant with staying power."
1,2016-12-01," Sure, you can buy your uncle a necktie that he won't wear, or your niece an Amazon certificate that she'll forget to use. Or you can help remove shrapnel from an injured child in Syria, or assist students at risk of genocide in South Sudan. The major aid organizations have special catalogs this time of year: You can buy an alpaca for a family for $150 at Heifer International, help educate a girl for $75 at Save the Children or help extend a much-admired microsavings program for $25 at Care. But this year my annual holiday gift list is special. I've tied some items to the election of Donald Trump, and I've looked for organizations that you may not have heard of: ■ One battle over the coming four years will involve family planning, because of G.O.P. efforts to defund Title X family planning programs and repeal Obamacare, which provides free birth control. So consider a donation to one of the most effective counterforces: the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, thenationalcampaign.org. The campaign takes no position on abortion (except to note that family planning reduces abortions), and it has bipartisan leadership, so it is more likely to get a hearing in a G.O.P.-controlled Washington. ■ As Syria and Russia commit war crimes in Aleppo, heroic physicians from America and other countries are traveling secretly to rebel-held areas of Syria to treat the wounded in underground hospitals and call attention to the carnage. They work through the Syrian American Medical Society, SAMS, sams-usa.net, which supports more than 100 medical facilities in Syria. ■ Human rights and press freedoms seem likely to get much less attention from the next administration, which makes this a good time to support the Committee to Protect Journalists, cpj.org. The C.P.J. speaks up for imprisoned journalists worldwide and tries to end impunity for those who murder journalists (at least 40 journalists have been killed worldwide so far in 2016 for their work). In the same vein, consider buying a gift subscription to a reliable news organization for yourself or a friend — as an investment in a robust civil society. ■ The recent hurricane in Haiti was devastating, and one of the most effective aid organizations in Haiti is Fonkoze, fonkoze.org, which has adopted a ""graduation model"" that has been particularly successful at combating global poverty. Founded by a local Catholic priest, Fonkoze works with the most impoverished women in Haiti over 18 months to get them earning regular incomes through raising livestock or selling merchandise. It's about teaching people how to fish, not handing out fish. I've seen it in action. It's terrific. ■ Congo is home to probably the most lethal conflict since World War II, and it is sometimes called the rape capital of the world. One of the heroes there is Dr. Denis Mukwege, who founded the Panzi hospital to treat injured women and risks his life to stand up to warlords. He has survived an assassination attempt and some day will get the Nobel Peace Prize — but in the meantime, you can support his hospital at panzifoundation.org. ■ Criminal justice may suffer setbacks in the coming years, which makes this an excellent time to support groups like Equal Justice Initiative, EJI.org, founded by a legendary lawyer named Bryan Stevenson. If attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions has an opposite, it is Stevenson. E.J.I. fights for indigent defendants and has won the release of inmates who were falsely arrested. It battles mass incarceration and is a voice for racial justice. And Stevenson's memoir, ""Just Mercy,"" also makes a great gift. ■ I've reported on crimes against humanity unfolding in South Sudan, one of the world's poorest countries, and now the United Nations is warning of the risk of full-blown genocide. In this impossible situation, a South Sudan-born American named Valentino Deng is running a high school, one of few still functioning. It needs support so students can get an education and build their country. You may remember Valentino: He's the ""lost boy"" at the center of Dave Eggers's best-selling book ""What Is the What."" What he has done since, in founding this school, is even more impressive. It's time to announce my annual win-a-trip contest, in which I choose a university student to accompany me on a reporting trip looking at global poverty and justice issues. I'm thinking about a 2017 trip to Liberia and Sierra Leone, or perhaps to Bangladesh. Information about how to apply is on my blog, nytimes.com/ontheground, and thanks in advance to the Center for Global Development in Washington for helping me pick a winner. The win-a-trip journey is exhausting and may involve bed bugs, rats and the worst food you've ever eaten. But it is a chance to help shine a light on important and neglected topics, so if you know students perfect for the trip, encourage them to apply."
0,2016-12-05," SEATTLE — There is almost no aspect of retail that Amazon has not upended with online shopping. Now, the company is trying to computerize the experience of buying sandwiches and soda from the corner convenience store. In the latest in its expanding set of experiments involving bricks-and-mortar retail stores, Amazon has created a small grocery store in Seattle that will allow customers to pluck drinks, prepared meals and other items off shelves and walk out without having to wait in a checkout line, the company said. Amazon said on its website that a smartphone app and various other types of technology in the store had eliminated the usual bottleneck of cashiers and registers that typically stand between shoppers and the store exit. For now, only Amazon employees can shop in the 1,800-square-foot store, which is on the ground floor of one of the company's new office towers in downtown Seattle. The company said that it planned to open the store to the public early next year and that it would offer chef-made meal kits with ingredients for quickly preparing dinners at home. ""Four years ago, we started to wonder: What would shopping look like if you could walk into a store, grab what you want and just go?"" a narrator says in a video about the store concept, called Amazon Go, which the company posted online on Monday. Amazon did not say what its expansion plans were for Amazon Go. If they are anything like what the company has done with its other bricks-and-mortar stores, new locations will open elsewhere slowly over time as Amazon learns how customers use the first one. Amazon opened its first physical bookstore just over a year ago in a Seattle shopping mall. It has added others in the San Diego and Portland, Ore., areas and has said it will open new bookstores in Chicago and Boston. It is also working on another grocery store concept that would allow customers to order food items online and then pick them up quickly by pulling into parking stalls. Two such stores are under construction in Seattle, according to documents filed with the city's planning department and people with knowledge of the effort who asked for anonymity because the plans were confidential. Pia Arthur, an Amazon spokeswoman, declined to comment on the grocery pickup locations. In the grand scheme of Amazon's business, analysts consider the retail stores to be an infinitesimal portion of the more than $135 billion in sales expected from the company this year. But the plans reflect a growing recognition by the company that certain categories of shopping are unlikely to move completely online. In some cases, it is simply more convenient to buy items in a store or more attractive to browse for them on physical shelves. ""The way we think about it is the size of online retail is going to continue to grow dramatically but there will always be an offline option,"" said Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. ""They're trying to streamline and capture a portion of that offline experience."" Amazon still views technology as being useful in overhauling shopping in traditional retail shops. While the company has not said exactly how the Amazon Go stores will work, visitors will gain entry to them through a smartphone app. The company said the stores relied on a variety of technologies similar to those in self-driving cars, including those defined by buzzwords such as ""computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning."" Unanswered for now are questions about how the stores would handle shoplifting and whether there would be employees on hand to check identification cards for alcohol purchases."
0,2016-12-06," ITAMATATUBA, Brazil — As the riverboat anchored at dawn in Itamatatuba, a far-flung outpost of the Brazilian Amazon, the court clerk rose from his hammock onboard. The bailiffs sipped their coffee. The judge rubbed the sleep from her eyes. ""Let's see what's on the docket,"" said Judge Mayra Brandão, 37, reviewing the day's cases: a tavern owner wanted for falling behind on child support, an arson threat and a rancher charged with firing his shotgun at his neighbor's herd of water buffaloes. I spent a day in October aboard this floating courthouse as it braved choppy currents, malarial mosquitoes and the threat of pirates to provide something exceptional in Brazil's unruly Amazonian frontier: the rule of law. The judge and her staff board this three-story riverboat, called the King Benedict, every few weeks from Macapá, the capital of Amapá State, and set out on the Amazon River. Until recently, local oligarchs supplanted the judiciary with their own domineering rule. Mob justice remains common, and lynchings are frequent. All too often, the jungle's residents still reach for machetes to settle feuds. ""That's where we come in,"" said Sgt. Eurismar da Cruz, 47, a police officer from Macapá who serves as a bailiff in the riverboat court. Wielding pistols, he and other bailiffs fan out each morning on a small speedboat in search of people suspected of committing crimes. Their first target on a Friday morning in Itamatatuba, a village of wooden shacks with about 600 inhabitants, was Jhon Beyck Pantoja, 35, the owner of the settlement's only discothèque. At a table on the boat's deck where hammocks hung just hours earlier, one of Mr. Pantoja's five ex-wives, Talia de Paula, 19, told the court that he had recently stopped paying her $30 a month in child support for their 3-year-old daughter, Manuela. ""The man is a scoundrel, a liar and a philanderer,"" Ms. de Paula said, bouncing Manuela on her knee as she glared at her ex-husband. Mr. Pantoja, clad in shorts and sandals and flashing a gold watch on his wrist, called his predicament ""complicated."" He said that he had five children by five wives over the years, and that paying child support for each of them was an unrealistic burden on his meager finances. ""I pay them all when I have the money, but some months are tougher than others,"" said Mr. Pantoja, whose outdoor nightclub, Caribe, lures patrons on weekend nights who cling to one another under its strobe lights. One of the court's clerks interjected, telling Mr. Pantoja, ""Frankly, you just have to stop making more children."" Then the judge issued a quick verdict, ordering the defendant to honor his financial obligations to his ex-wife or be jailed for three months. As Ms. de Paula smiled at the outcome, Mr. Pantoja scowled. ""The authorities on this boat don't rely on facts, but on gossip,"" he said. ""At least I'll have children to carry my coffin when I die."" Throughout the day, others shuffled onto the boat. Some sought the other services available onboard, receiving social security cards, voting papers and water purification tablets. Amapá's floating courtroom first set sail in the 1990s to address some of the shortcomings in Brazil's legal system. The country's judiciary is reviled by many citizens for its gargantuan bureaucracy, slowness in delivering verdicts and outsize salaries for judges. Since then, other Brazilian states have created similar projects. The authorities elsewhere in the world, including rural Pakistan and the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation in South Dakota, have used buses as mobile courtrooms. Conditions on the King Benedict are cramped. Staff members' sleeping hammocks bump each other during the night as currents rock the vessel. The only semblance of air-conditioning is an occasional breeze, allowing for a dress code of shorts and sandals. Sometimes proceedings are halted when the ear-piercing groans of howler monkeys drown out conversation. Still, the vibe onboard is mellow. After dusk, the members of the court gathered on the top deck to sip beer under a mesmerizing night sky, singing along as Rubens Barros, 38, the boat's chief law clerk, strummed a guitar to songs like ""Sina,"" by the Brazilian composer Djavan. ""Each voyage is a bonding experience, but we stick to some basic decorum: Keep your shirt on, respect the person in the hammock next to you, and if you drink beer, then do so in moderation,"" Mr. Barros said. Still, not everyone is impressed when the floating courtroom makes its way through the heavily forested Bailique Archipelago, an assortment of islands on which about 7,000 people live. ""My taxes pay for justice, but I feel the approach is superficial,"" said Andreia Figueiredo, the principal of the small public school in Itamatatuba. ""They pursue cases involving humble people, but what about large-scale deforestation or political corruption? There's no riverboat going after the biggest thieves."" In the last case of the day, bailiffs hauled in Conceição Pantoja, 67, whose brother accused him of firing on a neighbor's herd of water buffaloes. Mr. Pantoja argued that he was innocent of any wrongdoing, saying he had fired his rifle only to fend off jaguars attacking his own herd. ""Sir, don't you know it's illegal to kill jaguars in this country?"" Judge Brandão asked the defendant. Mr. Pantoja was charged with illegal possession and use of a firearm, crimes that could put him in prison for four years. Judge Brandão agreed to rule on his case on the boat's next swing through Itamatatuba. ""We used to be free in these parts to settle things our own way,"" he said. ""Now the city people on this boat want to tell a man how to live his life."""

0,2016-12-07," Her crime spawned tabloid coverage, quickie books and three made-for-TV movies. Now Amy Fisher, who became known as the Long Island Lolita  nearly a quarter of a century ago when she shot her lover's wife, has inspired something rarer: a made-for-TV aria. The idea was hatched as a joke in the writers' room of ""Mozart in the Jungle,"" the Golden Globe-winning Amazon comedy whose third season starts Friday. But to bring it off the show took it very seriously, persuading the composer Nico Muhly to take a break from working on his second opera for the Metropolitan Opera to write the music and engaging the soprano Ana María Martínez to record it during her recent run at the San Francisco Opera. In its offbeat way, the show revived the long-dormant practice of commissioning new opera for TV. ""All I kept thinking was, why isn't this story an opera already?"" recalled Peter Morris, a playwright and writer on the series who wrote the aria's libretto. ""It's perfect for a sort of postmodern 21st-century opera, because it was basically a grand opera plot that subverted itself. She was an aspiring femme fatale, but she didn't pull it off, thank heavens."" The aria will be a fleeting — but important — moment in the new season of ""Mozart in the Jungle,"" which combines screwball comedy and magical realism to tell the story of a fictional New York orchestra. With the musicians locked out in a labor dispute, the season begins with their music director, played by Gael García Bernal, in Venice working on the comeback concert of a Maria Callas-like diva portrayed by Monica Bellucci. While the series appeals to viewers who care little about classical music — Wired recommended binge-watching it more despite the music than for it — it does take the music seriously. A haircut gag in the new season will likely be funnier to those who recognize the music from Saint-Saëns's ""Samson et Dalila,"" whose hero derives strength from his hair. When the series made its debut in 2014, it was met with tsk-tsking from the classical music establishment, with objections raised to the way some of the actors held their bows or cleaned their oboes. But as it has grown more ambitious, and wackier, the music world has warmed to it. Several galas' worth of classical stars have appeared in cameos — giving them the uncommon opportunity to appear on a small screen that is not a public television station. (Look for Plácido Domingo, singing on the Grand Canal, this season.) Amy Fisher's aria follows a tradition of true-crime opera: Leoncavallo said his blood-soaked verismo masterpiece ""Pagliacci"" was inspired by a real incident, and Mr. Muhly's recent opera ""Two Boys"" was based on a murder in England. But ""Mozart"" did not set out to use the story of Amy Fisher, who was a Long Island high school student when she had an affair with an auto body repairman, Joey Buttafuoco, and shot and wounded his wife, Mary Jo. The writers wanted to give their prima donna a contemporary piece to take her out of her comfort zone — and realized that a made-to-order aria could be tailored to resonate with a love triangle. Mr. Morris drew up a ""list of women with guns"" who might make operatic heroines: Ulrike Meinhof, the German radical; Valerie Solanas, who shot Andy Warhol; and Jean Harris, who killed Herman Tarnower, who wrote the Scarsdale diet book. ""Then I Googled them, and I swear to God, this list of not particularly household names — every one of them was already an opera, or rumored for an opera,"" he said. Then he hit on the idea of Amy Fisher and reached out to Mr. Muhly, a longtime friend who had actually recommended him for the ""Mozart"" writing job. ""I asked him, 'What do you think of Amy Fisher?'"" Mr. Morris recalled. ""And he said, 'Oh my God, I saw her on 'Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew!'"" They got to work, debating in texts and emails whether a part of Mr. Morris's libretto should rhyme. (They agreed it should, inspired by the words leading up to ""Dido's Lament"" in Purcell's ""Dido and Aeneas."") Then Mr. Muhly set it to music, conjuring a sound world of looped voices, electronic instruments and repetitive counting to try to imagine Ms. Fisher just before the shooting. ""It feels like something that's specifically operatic — that you can access that combination of emotion, motivation, motility, all those things at once, in a way that only opera can,"" Mr. Muhly said. ""The thing I tried very hard to do was not turn it into a kind of funny, ha-ha, let's-laugh-at-her thing."" Ms. Martínez, who had a breakthrough at the Met last season in Puccini's ""Madama Butterfly,"" said she tried to empathize with the Fisher character before recording the aria, which will be included on a soundtrack from Sony Classical. ""Because if you don't love them — and you don't get into their mind, truly — you will hold them in judgment,"" she said. ""And then the audience is not getting the character, they're getting a narrator telling you something."" Sitting beside the Grand Canal during a break in the shooting last summer in Venice, Ms. Bellucci said she had worked with an opera coach and studied videos of Maria Callas, Anna Netrebko and Beverly Sills to prepare for her lip-syncing scenes. ""It was so interesting to see how they move onstage, and also how everything is so fragile — because they have an instrument inside themselves."" The new aria recalls when TV regularly commissioned operas. In the 1950s, NBC broadcast new work by Gian Carlo Menotti, Bohuslav Martinu and Lukas Foss; Benjamin Britten wrote ""Owen Wingrave"" for the BBC. So will the rest of the Long Island Lolita opera ever be written? Mr. Muhly allowed that it ""could be a sort of monodrama,"" or work for one performer. And Mr. Morris was enthusiastic. ""I would love it if we did."""
0,2016-12-09," An enduring air of mystery surrounds the towering cross emblazoned with a swastika in a cemetery near the remote Brazilian jungle outpost of Laranjal do Jari. An inscription on the cross, in German, reads: ""Joseph Greiner died here of fever on Jan. 2, 1936, in the service of German research."" Why is there a Nazi grave in the far reaches of Brazil's Amazon rain forest? Researchers have meticulously documented how Nazi war criminals fled to South America in the aftermath of World War II. But much less is known about a plot that took root before and during the war: The Nazis hoped to establish a German bridgehead in South America by conquering a swath of the Amazon River Basin. The secret plan, called the Guyana Project, had its origins in an expedition into the Amazon led by Otto Schulz-Kampfhenkel, a Berlin zoologist, documentary filmmaker and member of Hitler's SS. For 17 months, from 1935 to 1937, Nazi explorers under the guidance of Mr. Schulz-Kampfhenkel hacked through forests around Brazil's border with French Guiana. They collected animal skulls and indigenous jewelry, and they studied the topography along the Jari River, a 491-mile tributary of the Amazon. ""The expedition started out with the usual scientific pretensions,"" said Jens Glüsing, a longtime correspondent in Brazil for the German magazine Der Spiegel who wrote a book about the Guyana Project. ""But back in Germany, as the war started, Schulz-Kampfhenkel seized on this idea for Nazi colonial expansion."" Mr. Schulz-Kampfhenkel presented his plan in 1940 to Heinrich Himmler, the chief of the SS and the Gestapo. It envisioned the endeavor as a way to blunt the regional sway of the United States by seizing control of French Guiana and the neighboring Dutch and British colonies (now the independent nations of Suriname and Guyana). But the dream of forging a German Guiana fizzled. Perhaps it was because French Guiana had already fallen into the friendly hands of the collaborationist Vichy regime. Or maybe it had to do with the ill-fated Jari expedition itself. The expedition had a Heinkel He 72 Seekadett seaplane, which was promoted as an example of Nazi industrial innovation. But the aircraft capsized after hitting driftwood a few weeks into the expedition. Throughout their journey, the explorers from a self-described ""master race"" had to rely on indigenous tribes to survive and find their way in the jungle. The Germans were enfeebled by malaria and other illnesses. Mr. Schulz-Kampfhenkel endured severe diphtheria, and an unspecified fever killed Mr. Greiner, the expedition's foreman. His grave stands to this day as a testament to the star-crossed Nazi foray into the Amazon."
0,2016-12-13," LONDON — Within five minutes of the first episode of ""Fleabag,"" Phoebe Waller-Bridge is masturbating over President Obama. As he gives a speech on her laptop, her right hand drifts down under the duvet. ""There will be difficult days along the way,"" Mr. Obama warns. The screen starts to jiggle. That sequence is ""Fleabag"" in a nutshell: irreverent, lewd and upfront to a fault. In this sitcom, which has been available on Amazon Prime since September, Ms Waller-Bridge plays a 20-something woman — never named, just Fleabag — with an insatiable sexual appetite. She picks up men on public transportation and reignites old flames, but beneath the bravado, she's a grieving, angsty, insecure mess. Fleabag is so liberated, she has gotten herself lost. The series, which grew out of a one-woman stage show, has shot this 31-year-old to success on both sides of the Atlantic: Britain's answer to Lena Dunham. The New Yorker declared it ""richer than many dramas,"" and Ms. Waller-Bridge has wound up on several ""Women of the Year"" lists. Backstage at the Soho Theater here, where she's reviving the original play in a run that sold out in just 10 minutes, she admits to feeling ""a certain amount of whiplash — but a pleasant sort of whiplash."" That might explain the itch to bring ""Fleabag"" back to the theater. ""I really, really felt the pull of wanting to do it as it was originally done,"" Ms. Waller-Bridge said. ""I was slightly trepidatious about people knowing the end, the reveal, but audiences seem so invested in the story that it doesn't seem to have affected it in any big way."" In a sense, Fleabag is a creature of the stage. Ms. Waller-Bridge likens her to ""a little devil running around, released from the guilt and shame of life."" In her compulsive oversharing and scornful eye-rolls, she has something of the court jester or sacred clown, allowed to tear through society's taboos. Her candor — be it sexual, societal or scatological — can be cathartic: ""I always knew that saying the unsayable was going to be a powerful thing."" Ms. Waller-Bridge seems born for that. Just shy of six feet tall, with a loose brown bob and prim features, she seems proper but speaks in profanities. Nothing's off limits: ""I just find all that stuff incredibly funny. I love a fart. I'd do anything for a good poo story."" She has never been drawn to stand-up (""so exposing, just you and a mike""), but ""Fleabag"" isn't all that different. It had its premiere at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe three years ago, in a damp, disused bank vault, having begun as 10 minutes of material written on a whim for a comic storytelling night. Here, the odd anecdote isn't autobiographical. It is all forged out her frustrations. ""I was feeling really, really cynical about love and sex and relationships and men,"" Ms. Waller-Bridge said. ""I was a real romantic until my early 20s, and then it did all become vagina shots and porn and expectations of sex."" Mostly, she was irked by the way she saw women portrayed. ""That's why I wanted to create a character who sexualized everything — from her pizza to her father,'' she said. ""It's been drilled into her that sex is the most powerful language for a woman."" The flip side is that Fleabag's shamelessness is perversely empowering. For Ms. Waller-Bridge, the writing should ""always be about the glory of being a woman,"" with Fleabag free to say anything. The result is the kind of curious, challenging feminism that emerged just as Ms. Waller-Bridge started writing. ""Fleabag knows men and women are equal and should be treated as such,"" she said, ""but what she's confused about — and what I was confused about — was the idea that wanting bigger boobs doesn't mean you don't want equal rights."" The same frustrations occurred professionally. Training at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, she found herself pushed in a particular direction. ""The fun of acting got lost on the way,"" she recalled. ""I went in wanting to be a character actor and left primed to be a quirky leading lady."" Bored with playing stereotypical, often subservient, roles — ""crying girls who had just had an abortion or were having a bath"" — she complained to the head of the academy and, in her final showcase, ended up with a brash role. Among the usual barflies of Lanford Wilson's 1965 play, ""Balm in Gilead,"" Ms. Waller-Bridge turned up, she said, as ""a transvestite with a beard and an enormous strap-on."" ""I looked exactly like Russell Brand,"" she added. After graduating, she set up a theater company called DryWrite with her best friend, Vicky Jones, who went on to direct ""Fleabag"" onstage. They challenged writers including Jack Thorne (now acclaimed for ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"") and Lucy Kirkwood (""Chimerica"") to push the envelope: ""Make the audience heckle"" or ""Get a laugh from something unfunny."" ""DryWrite writing nights were like nothing else,"" Mr. Thorne said. ""They were a party."" Ms. Waller-Bridge sees them differently. ""If I look back, it was such a shameless training ground,"" she said. ""I was in awe of all these writers, but I learned a lot from them."" It shows. Her earlier sitcom, ""Crashing,"" about a group of property guardians (they pay low rents to live in disused buildings) in a contemporary London squat, won her another TV commission: a comedy thriller, ""Killing Eve,"" about a psychopathic assassin and the spy on her tail. And what of ""Fleabag,"" which ran for six episodes and could stand as is? ""I was really determined that I wasn't going to do another series unless I could find another story,"" Ms. Waller-Bridge said. ""In my heart, this was the story. It had a beginning, a middle and an end."" She paused, then said, ""That's the thing I'm trying to crack at the moment."" ""Fleabag"" will be back."
1,2016-12-13," SAN FRANCISCO — At the top of the agenda when President-elect Donald J. Trump meets with tech leaders on Wednesday afternoon: jobs, jobs and more jobs. Other topics will come up too, depending on Mr. Trump's whims. One likely possibility: the repatriation of offshore cash. The top tech companies collectively hold hundreds of billions of dollars overseas. They would like to return the money to the United States at a beneficial tax rate. For Mr. Trump, a deal on these funds could represent money that would help advance an infrastructure program. But mostly, it will be about jobs. The tech community has put its products in every home and pocket, generating enormous wealth along the way. But the companies employ relatively few people, and the wealth is concentrated in places like Silicon Valley and Seattle. Changing this equation is the task of Peter Thiel, the tech investor who is now advising Mr. Trump. The meeting agenda, which was still a work in progress, was described by a person briefed on the round table, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk about it publicly. A Trump transition spokeswoman did not return a request for comment. Those attending the meeting, which will be held at Trump Tower in Manhattan, include: ■ Elon Musk of Tesla ■ Larry Page and Eric E. Schmidt of Alphabet, Google's parent ■ Timothy D. Cook of Apple ■ Satya Nadella of Microsoft ■ Jeff Bezos of Amazon ■ Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook ■ Safra A. Catz of Oracle ■ Brian M. Krzanich of Intel ■ Chuck Robbins of Cisco ■ Ginni Rometty of IBM The companies are generally keeping a low profile about the event. Several of them were Mr. Trump's targets during the campaign over issues as varied as offshoring, digital security and antitrust issues. They also saw how a post-Election Day meeting with television executives, while supposedly off the record, turned into public humiliation after Mr. Trump attacked them. The Information Technology Industry Council, a trade association for the tech industry, held a conference call last Friday with some of its members — which include Apple, Amazon and Facebook — to formulate a unified approach. Dean C. Garfield, president of the council, was guarded about the meeting's prospects. ""There are many areas of potential shared alignment between the technology industry and the incoming Trump administration,"" Mr. Garfield said. ""Wednesday's meeting is a good opportunity to explore what is possible."" Ms. Rometty, a member of Mr. Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum, is championing a new educational model for the United States that focuses on vocational training. Six-year public high schools that ""combine traditional education with the best of community colleges"" would provide IBM and other companies with the relevant skills for ""new collar"" information-technology jobs, she wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump after the election. There is no simple policy change that could spread tech's success to parts of the country that are reeling. Facebook employs relatively few people. Apple manufactures its products mostly in China and says reproducing its intricate ecosystem here would push up prices drastically for iPhones. Amazon has created tens of thousands of jobs in its warehouses across the country but is also blamed by critics for forcing small retailers out of business. Two companies were invited to the meeting on Wednesday but are not showing up: the ride-hailing company Uber and the short-term home rental service Airbnb. Perhaps it is merely coincidence, but both companies are at the forefront of the debate about jobs and the digital economy. Fans say they provide flexible work for those who need to supplement their incomes. Critics say they are poor substitutes for full-time jobs. Airbnb said that its chief executive, Brian Chesky, was traveling overseas, and that nothing more should be read into his absence. ""We look forward to working with the incoming administration, and others in Washington, on a range of issues,"" said Nick Papas, a company spokesman. He declined to say where Mr. Chesky was. An Uber spokesman said its chief executive, Travis Kalanick, was in India this week. Apple has already drawn the president-elect's scrutiny over jobs. ""One of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States,"" Mr. Trump said in late November. On Monday, in what perhaps could be seen as a pre-emptive strike, Apple was revealed to be negotiating a major investment in a technology fund celebrated by Mr. Trump last week for its jobs-making potential. Apple has held discussions about potentially participating in a $100 billion fund to be run by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, according to a person briefed on the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions are private. SoftBank's founder, Masayoshi Son, pledged last week to the president-elect that his company would invest $50 billion in the United States and create some 50,000 jobs. After Mr. Trump tweeted that news, some pointed out that the fund had been created before the election and that much of the investment would probably have been in this country no matter what. Apple's discussions with SoftBank, which was the first Japanese telecommunications company to sell the iPhone in Japan, are not close to completion, the person briefed on the talks cautioned. And the discussions began well before Mr. Son's meeting with Mr. Trump. The talks were reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal. Apple declined to comment. Silicon Valley was largely opposed to Mr. Trump as a candidate — sometimes vocally, sometimes quietly. In the wake of his election, there is a shift in attitudes. Perhaps it is simple pragmatism, but more conciliatory voices are being heard. Mr. Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post — a frequent scourge of Mr. Trump during the election — tweeted his congratulations. ""I for one give him my most open mind,"" he said. Ms. Catz, the co-chief executive of Oracle, was even more enthusiastic. ""I plan to tell the president-elect that we are with him and are here to help in any way we can,"" she said in a statement. And on Tuesday, one big tech name met Mr. Trump ahead of the rest. Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and now primarily a philanthropist, was at Trump Tower in the early afternoon. ""It was a good time,"" Mr. Gates said. ""We had a good conversation about innovation, how it can help in health, education, the impact of foreign aid and energy, and a wide-ranging conversation about power of innovation."""
0,2016-12-14," When Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, first said that the e-commerce giant wanted to use drones to deliver packages directly to customers' homes, many people thought he was crazy. Three years later, his claims no longer look so outlandish. On Wednesday, Mr. Bezos announced on Twitter that his company had made its first commercial drone delivery, on Dec. 7, to an Amazon shopper in Cambridgeshire, England, a major step forward in its experiments with automated shipments. The flight — to deliver an Amazon Fire streaming device and popcorn to a customer identified only as Richard B. — took off from a nearby Amazon warehouse and lasted 13 minutes, covering about two miles. Amazon said it would now test drone deliveries with two more customers near Cambridge, an English city where the company has a large drone-testing plant. If the tests are successful, the company says it wants to expand the number of consumers who could participate in the trial to dozens in the coming months, eventually allowing hundreds to use the drone service. The start of customer trials for the drone delivery service, which Amazon calls Prime Air, is a milestone for a technology that could eventually automate an important part of Amazon's business as the company looks to cement its position as the world's dominant online retailer. There are reasons to be skeptical about how broadly drones can be used, however, because of aviation rules, weather restrictions and weight limitations on cargo. Experts say that the advent of widespread drone deliveries, even if technically possible, would take years, and regulators from the United States and elsewhere could block the plans. Even if drones end up handling only a small portion of Amazon's overall deliveries, the implications could be far-reaching. The company, for instance, might not need as many truck drivers or other costly logistical operations. Drones could also have environmental benefits, by reducing reliance on pollution-belching vehicles. The biggest boon may be to customers, who could be able to receive their orders more quickly, depending where they live. The fact that Amazon's latest drone tests were in Britain is no coincidence. The country's regulators have been more cooperative than their American counterparts about such flights, even signing an agreement with Amazon in July to allow the testing of drones in rural and suburban areas. As part of those trials — some of which have taken place at a secretive farm in rural Cambridgeshire — Amazon has been allowed to fly drones without a human pilot at the controls, navigating to destinations solely by GPS. The company says it has developed ""sense-and-avoid"" technology to help the machines fly around towers, birds and other obstructions. Not all of the residents in the area have been fans, however. Julia Napier, who helped found a Cambridgeshire association that maintains public footpaths around one of Amazon's test sites, said the company's drones threatened wildlife and the wider countryside, something that the company has denied. ""They are testing those drones here because they can't do it in America,"" she said. ""Whatever the Americans don't want, I don't want it, either."" While Amazon has experimented with different drone designs, the one that makes the delivery in the company's video appears to be a quadcopter — a helicopter with four rotors — that can take off and land vertically. So far, the devices are limited to carrying cargo weighing less than five pounds. They use cameras to identify landing marker pads that customers place in their backyards or in other unobstructed locations. In the United States, regulators have been more cautious about drone tests, though the Federal Aviation Administration issued new rules this year to allow for the commercial use of drones under certain circumstances. One major limitation was the stipulation that devices must be operated remotely by a human pilot. Amazon is not the first company to test drone delivery. The Chinese internet retailer JD.com has a fleet of drones flying autonomously on round trips of a maximum of 15 miles to reach rural communities (though a person still takes the package on the last leg of its journey to the recipient). In New Zealand, Domino's Pizza is testing drones to deliver fast food across the country. And in the United States, 7-Eleven said in July that it had delivered Slurpees, doughnuts and other food to a customer in Reno, Nev. Google has tested drone delivery of Chipotle burritos on the Virginia Tech campus. Amazon, however, with its deep pockets, logistical expertise and technological prowess, still seems the most likely to push widespread drone delivery into the mainstream, at least in the Western world."
1,2016-12-14," The meeting between President-elect Donald J. Trump and the nation's tech elite was hyped as something out of ""The Apprentice"": The new boss tells his minions to shape up. It turned out to be a charm offensive, a kind of ""Dancing With the Silicon Valley Stars."" ""This is a truly amazing group of people,"" the president-elect said on Wednesday in a 25th-floor conference room at Trump Tower in Manhattan. The gathering included Jeff Bezos of Amazon; Elon Musk of Tesla; Timothy D. Cook of Apple; Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook; Larry Page and Eric Schmidt of Alphabet, Google's parent company; and Satya Nadella of Microsoft, among others. ""I'm here to help you folks do well,"" Mr. Trump said. He kept going in that vein. ""There's nobody like you in the world,"" he enthused. ""In the world! There's nobody like the people in this room."" Anything that the government ""can do to help this go along,"" he made clear, ""we're going to be there for you."" And that was just in the first few minutes. The candidate who warned during the presidential campaign that Amazon was going to have antitrust problems, that Apple needed to build its iPhones in the United States instead of China, was nowhere to be seen. Even after the press was ushered out, the meeting continued its genial way. Among the topics discussed, according to several corporate executives and a transition official briefed on the meeting, who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, were vocational education and the need for more of it, the promise and peril of trade with China and immigration (Mr. Trump wants ""smart and talented people here""). The president-elect also asked the executives to see if they could not apply data analysis technology to detect and help get rid of government waste. There are plans for quarterly meetings of a smaller group of tech executives, to be organized by Mr. Trump's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, said one of the executives briefed on the meeting. They will focus mainly on immigration and education issues. The meeting lasted more than 90 minutes, longer than expected. Mr. Trump was seated next to Peter Thiel, the tech investor who is a member of the president-elect's transition team. In another sign of Mr. Trump mixing family, business and government hats, three of his adult children — Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric — also attended. ""I won't tell you the hundreds of calls we've had asking to come to this meeting,"" Mr. Trump told his guests. Everyone laughed. To get to the 25th-floor conference room, the tech leaders entered the golden elevators of Trump Tower the same way anyone would — by punching a button. This gave the news media, cordoned off a few feet away, time to shout questions. None of the executives took the bait. Neither did they talk on the way out, although by that time the building was being closed for Trump Tower's holiday party. Safra Catz, the co-chief of Oracle who attended the meeting, gave a thumbs up. Mr. Bezos later issued a statement that said he found the meeting ""very productive."" ""I shared the view that the administration should make innovation one of its key pillars, which would create a huge number of jobs across the whole country, in all sectors, not just tech — agriculture, infrastructure, manufacturing — everywhere,"" he said. The technology world had been in turmoil as the meeting drew near. Some argued the chief executives should boycott the event to show their disdain for Mr. Trump's values. Others maintained they should go and forthrightly make their values clear. And still others thought they should attend and make their accommodations with the new reality. ""There is a wide spectrum of feeling in the Valley,"" said Aaron Levie, the chief executive of the cloud storage company Box. Complicating the debate was the fact that the most fervently anti-Trump elements in Silicon Valley seem to be the start-ups and venture capitalists, few of which were invited to the meeting. (Alex Karp, the chief executive of Palantir Technologies, was the only head of a privately held tech company at the meeting.) Some tech companies were also notable for their absence. Twitter, the president-elect's medium of choice for communication, was not invited. Twitter declined to comment on why it was not included. A campaign official complained last month in a Medium post that Twitter had killed a #CrookedHillary emoji. On Wednesday, Sean Spicer, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, said that Twitter had been left out of the meeting because of space considerations in a gathering that many other technology executives were ""dying to get into."" In the days and hours before the meeting, various factions made their positions clear. A group of engineers and other tech workers issued a statement asserting that they would refuse to participate in the creation of databases that could be used by the government to target people based on their race, religion or national origin. The proclamation immediately drew more than 500 signatories, including employees at Google, Apple and Microsoft. During the campaign, Mr. Trump did not rule out the idea of a database of Muslims. Another group of entrepreneurs assembled virtually this week with the same goal of preventing any erosion of civil liberties. They also accepted ""a responsibility to partner with communities where the effects of rapidly changing technologies have hurt our fellow Americans."" Among those signing were Aileen Lee, a venture capitalist; Dave McClure, of the 500 Start-Ups incubator; and Lenny Mendonca, an angel investor. Mr. Levie, of Box, was a Hillary Clinton supporter but believes in engagement with the new administration. ""We have to face reality that this is the next four years, and the best way to make sure our values are upheld is actually push on them,"" he said. Other tech chief executives also took the same route. Hours before Mr. Trump's meeting with tech leaders, the president-elect announced that Mr. Musk and Travis Kalanick, Uber's chief executive, would be among those joining his Strategic and Policy Forum, which is already stacked with businesspeople from finance and other industries. Ginni Rometty, the chief executive of IBM, had previously joined the forum. More than values and policy are at stake in the relationship between the administration and the Valley. Money is, too. In the wake of Mr. Trump's victory, Forrester Research is cutting back its growth estimate for the United States tech market in 2017 to 4.3 percent from 5.1 percent. One reason is simple caution, as large multinational manufacturers navigate a new and unpredictable administration. Another reason: less tech spending by the government. ""There are so many cabinet secretaries who are explicitly hostile to the mission of their agencies,"" said Andrew Bartels, a Forrester principal analyst. As for 2018, there are so many ways things could go that a forecast is impossible. ""It's up for grabs,"" the analyst said. So, too, is the relationship of Mr. Trump and the tech industry. For the moment, though, Silicon Valley seems to have dodged a bullet."
2,2016-12-14," CALÇOENE, Brazil — As the foreman for a cattle ranch in the far reaches of the Brazilian Amazon, Lailson Camelo da Silva was razing trees to convert rain forest into pasture when he stumbled across a bizarre arrangement of towering granite blocks. ""I had no idea that I was discovering the Amazon's own Stonehenge,"" said Mr. da Silva, 65, on a scorching October day as he gazed at the archaeological site located just north of the Equator. ""It makes me wonder: What other secrets about our past are still hidden in Brazil's jungles?"" After conducting radiocarbon testing and carrying out measurements during the winter solstice, scholars in the field of archaeoastronomy determined that an indigenous culture arranged the megaliths into an astronomical observatory about 1,000 years ago, or five centuries before the European conquest of the Americas began. Their findings, along with other archaeological discoveries in Brazil in recent years — including giant land carvings, remains of fortified settlements and even complex road networks — are upending earlier views of archaeologists who argued that the Amazon had been relatively untouched by humans except for small, nomadic tribes. Instead, some scholars now assert that the world's largest tropical rain forest was far less ""Edenic"" than previously imagined, and that the Amazon supported a population of as many as 10 million people before the epidemics and large-scale slaughter put into motion by European colonizers. In what is now the sparsely populated state of Amapá in northern Brazil, the sun stones found by Mr. da Silva near a stream called the Rego Grande are yielding clues about how indigenous peoples in the Amazon may have been far more sophisticated than assumed by archaeologists in the 20th century. ""We're starting to piece together the puzzle of the Amazon Basin's human history, and what we're finding in Amapá is absolutely fascinating,"" said Mariana Cabral, an archaeologist at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, who together with her husband, João Saldanha, also an archaeologist, has studied the Rego Grande site for the last decade. Back in the late 19th century, the Swiss zoologist Emílio Goeldi had spotted megaliths — large monumental stones — on an expedition through Brazil's frontier with French Guiana. Other scholars, including the pioneering American archaeologist Betty Meggers, also came across such sites, but argued that the Amazon was inhospitable to complex human settlements. It was not until Mr. da Silva, the former ranch foreman, came across the stones at Rego Grande while deforesting surrounding jungle in the 1990s that scholars focused greater attention on the findings. Mr. da Silva said he first stumbled on the site while hunting wild boar as a teenager in the 1960s, but had subsequently avoided the area. ""The place initially felt sacred, like we didn't belong here,"" said Mr. da Silva, who now guards the Rego Grande site as its custodian. ""But it was impossible to miss it during the deforestation drive of the '90s, when the priority was to burn down trees."" About 10 years ago, after securing public funds to cordon off the stones, Brazilian archaeologists led by Ms. Cabral and Mr. Saldanha began excavating the site, which is shaped roughly like a circle. They soon identified a portion of a river about two miles away where the granite blocks may have been quarried. They also found ceramic burial urns, suggesting that at least part of the Rego Grande site may have been a cemetery, while colleagues from Amapá's Institute of Scientific and Technological Research discovered that one of the tall stones seemed to be aligned with the sun's path during the winter solstice. After identifying other points in the site where stones could be associated with the sun's movement on the solstice, the researchers began piecing together a theory that Rego Grande could have served various ceremonial and astronomical functions connected to agricultural or hunting cycles. Ms. Cabral said that Rego Grande and a series of other less elaborate megalithic sites found in Amapá may have also served as markers for hunters or fishermen on a landscape that was being transformed by Amazonian peoples a millennium ago. Still, other scholars say that more information may be needed about Rego Grande to lift it into the realm of prehistoric places clearly conceived for astronomical observations. ""We've seen a lot of similar claims, but it takes more than a circle of standing stones to get to a Stonehenge,"" said Jarita Holbrook, a scholar of physics and cultural astronomy at the University of the Western Cape in South Africa, citing the need for more findings about Rego Grande's characteristics and how the site was used by the people who built it. For now, Rego Grande, which local people already call the Amazonian Stonehenge, remains enigmatic. Pottery shards jut through the soil as if offering tantalizing clues around the place, which has the feel of a contemporary conceptual art piece. Researchers are still trying to determine how Rego Grande fits into the evolving views on the Amazon's human history. Representatives of the Palikur, an indigenous people living in Amapá and French Guiana, have recently stepped forward to say that their ancestors had frequented Rego Grande. Still, archaeologists express caution about establishing such links, emphasizing how much can change in human societies over the span of a thousand years. Ms. Cabral, the archaeologist who has spent years studying Rego Grande, said that evidence of large settlements remains elusive, in contrast with other sites in the Amazon like Kuhikugu, at the headwaters of the Xingu River, where researchers have drawn parallels to the legends surrounding the mythical Lost City of Z, long an irresistible lure for explorers and adventurers. Either way, John McKim Malville, a solar physicist at the University of Colorado who writes extensively on archaeoastronomy, emphasized how the field is moving away from focusing exclusively on astronomical functions to interpretations that are more holistic, by including the ceremonies and rituals of ancient cultures. In that sense, the site in Calçoene offers a beguiling if cryptic glimpse into Amazonia's past. ""The stones of Rego Grande are quite extraordinary and in their irregularity may have their own unique meaning, different from other megalithic sites around the world,"" Mr. Malville said, raising the possibility that Rego Grande reflects the importance in Amazonian cultures of animism, the attribution of a soul to entities in nature and even inanimate objects. He added, ""We can only speculate what its stones mean."""

The president-elect also asked the executives to see if they could not apply data analysis technology to detect and help get rid of government waste. There are plans for quarterly meetings of a smaller group of tech executives, to be organized by Mr. Trump's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, said one of the executives briefed on the meeting. They will focus mainly on immigration and education issues. The meeting lasted more than 90 minutes, longer than expected. Mr. Trump was seated next to Peter Thiel, the tech investor who is a member of the president-elect's transition team. In another sign of Mr. Trump mixing family, business and government hats, three of his adult children — Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric — also attended. ""I won't tell you the hundreds of calls we've had asking to come to this meeting,"" Mr. Trump told his guests. Everyone laughed. To get to the 25th-floor conference room, the tech leaders entered the golden elevators of Trump Tower the same way anyone would — by punching a button. This gave the news media, cordoned off a few feet away, time to shout questions. None of the executives took the bait. Neither did they talk on the way out, although by that time the building was being closed for Trump Tower's holiday party. Safra Catz, the co-chief of Oracle who attended the meeting, gave a thumbs up. Mr. Bezos later issued a statement that said he found the meeting ""very productive."" ""I shared the view that the administration should make innovation one of its key pillars, which would create a huge number of jobs across the whole country, in all sectors, not just tech — agriculture, infrastructure, manufacturing — everywhere,"" he said. The technology world had been in turmoil as the meeting drew near. Some argued the chief executives should boycott the event to show their disdain for Mr. Trump's values. Others maintained they should go and forthrightly make their values clear. And still others thought they should attend and make their accommodations with the new reality. ""There is a wide spectrum of feeling in the Valley,"" said Aaron Levie, the chief executive of the cloud storage company Box. Complicating the debate was the fact that the most fervently anti-Trump elements in Silicon Valley seem to be the start-ups and venture capitalists, few of which were invited to the meeting. (Alex Karp, the chief executive of Palantir Technologies, was the only head of a privately held tech company at the meeting.) Some tech companies were also notable for their absence. Twitter, the president-elect's medium of choice for communication, was not invited. Twitter declined to comment on why it was not included. A campaign official complained last month in a Medium post that Twitter had killed a #CrookedHillary emoji. On Wednesday, Sean Spicer, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, said that Twitter had been left out of the meeting because of space considerations in a gathering that many other technology executives were ""dying to get into."" In the days and hours before the meeting, various factions made their positions clear. A group of engineers and other tech workers issued a statement asserting that they would refuse to participate in the creation of databases that could be used by the government to target people based on their race, religion or national origin. The proclamation immediately drew more than 500 signatories, including employees at Google, Apple and Microsoft. During the campaign, Mr. Trump did not rule out the idea of a database of Muslims. Another group of entrepreneurs assembled virtually this week with the same goal of preventing any erosion of civil liberties. They also accepted ""a responsibility to partner with communities where the effects of rapidly changing technologies have hurt our fellow Americans."" Among those signing were Aileen Lee, a venture capitalist; Dave McClure, of the 500 Start-Ups incubator; and Lenny Mendonca, an angel investor. Mr. Levie, of Box, was a Hillary Clinton supporter but believes in engagement with the new administration. ""We have to face reality that this is the next four years, and the best way to make sure our values are upheld is actually push on them,"" he said. Other tech chief executives also took the same route. Hours before Mr. Trump's meeting with tech leaders, the president-elect announced that Mr. Musk and Travis Kalanick, Uber's chief executive, would be among those joining his Strategic and Policy Forum, which is already stacked with businesspeople from finance and other industries. Ginni Rometty, the chief executive of IBM, had previously joined the forum. More than values and policy are at stake in the relationship between the administration and the Valley. Money is, too. In the wake of Mr. Trump's victory, Forrester Research is cutting back its growth estimate for the United States tech market in 2017 to 4.3 percent from 5.1 percent. One reason is simple caution, as large multinational manufacturers navigate a new and unpredictable administration. Another reason: less tech spending by the government. ""There are so many cabinet secretaries who are explicitly hostile to the mission of their agencies,"" said Andrew Bartels, a Forrester principal analyst. As for 2018, there are so many ways things could go that a forecast is impossible. ""It's up for grabs,"" the analyst said. So, too, is the relationship of Mr. Trump and the tech industry. For the moment, though, Silicon Valley seems to have dodged a bullet."
5,2016-12-14," CALÇOENE, Brazil — As the foreman for a cattle ranch in the far reaches of the Brazilian Amazon, Lailson Camelo da Silva was razing trees to convert rain forest into pasture when he stumbled across a bizarre arrangement of towering granite blocks. ""I had no idea that I was discovering the Amazon's own Stonehenge,"" said Mr. da Silva, 65, on a scorching October day as he gazed at the archaeological site located just north of the Equator. ""It makes me wonder: What other secrets about our past are still hidden in Brazil's jungles?"" After conducting radiocarbon testing and carrying out measurements during the winter solstice, scholars in the field of archaeoastronomy determined that an indigenous culture arranged the megaliths into an astronomical observatory about 1,000 years ago, or five centuries before the European conquest of the Americas began. Their findings, along with other archaeological discoveries in Brazil in recent years — including giant land carvings, remains of fortified settlements and even complex road networks — are upending earlier views of archaeologists who argued that the Amazon had been relatively untouched by humans except for small, nomadic tribes. Instead, some scholars now assert that the world's largest tropical rain forest was far less ""Edenic"" than previously imagined, and that the Amazon supported a population of as many as 10 million people before the epidemics and large-scale slaughter put into motion by European colonizers. In what is now the sparsely populated state of Amapá in northern Brazil, the sun stones found by Mr. da Silva near a stream called the Rego Grande are yielding clues about how indigenous peoples in the Amazon may have been far more sophisticated than assumed by archaeologists in the 20th century. ""We're starting to piece together the puzzle of the Amazon Basin's human history, and what we're finding in Amapá is absolutely fascinating,"" said Mariana Cabral, an archaeologist at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, who together with her husband, João Saldanha, also an archaeologist, has studied the Rego Grande site for the last decade. Back in the late 19th century, the Swiss zoologist Emílio Goeldi had spotted megaliths — large monumental stones — on an expedition through Brazil's frontier with French Guiana. Other scholars, including the pioneering American archaeologist Betty Meggers, also came across such sites, but argued that the Amazon was inhospitable to complex human settlements. It was not until Mr. da Silva, the former ranch foreman, came across the stones at Rego Grande while deforesting surrounding jungle in the 1990s that scholars focused greater attention on the findings. Mr. da Silva said he first stumbled on the site while hunting wild boar as a teenager in the 1960s, but had subsequently avoided the area. ""The place initially felt sacred, like we didn't belong here,"" said Mr. da Silva, who now guards the Rego Grande site as its custodian. ""But it was impossible to miss it during the deforestation drive of the '90s, when the priority was to burn down trees."" About 10 years ago, after securing public funds to cordon off the stones, Brazilian archaeologists led by Ms. Cabral and Mr. Saldanha began excavating the site, which is shaped roughly like a circle. They soon identified a portion of a river about two miles away where the granite blocks may have been quarried. They also found ceramic burial urns, suggesting that at least part of the Rego Grande site may have been a cemetery, while colleagues from Amapá's Institute of Scientific and Technological Research discovered that one of the tall stones seemed to be aligned with the sun's path during the winter solstice. After identifying other points in the site where stones could be associated with the sun's movement on the solstice, the researchers began piecing together a theory that Rego Grande could have served various ceremonial and astronomical functions connected to agricultural or hunting cycles. Ms. Cabral said that Rego Grande and a series of other less elaborate megalithic sites found in Amapá may have also served as markers for hunters or fishermen on a landscape that was being transformed by Amazonian peoples a millennium ago. Still, other scholars say that more information may be needed about Rego Grande to lift it into the realm of prehistoric places clearly conceived for astronomical observations. ""We've seen a lot of similar claims, but it takes more than a circle of standing stones to get to a Stonehenge,"" said Jarita Holbrook, a scholar of physics and cultural astronomy at the University of the Western Cape in South Africa, citing the need for more findings about Rego Grande's characteristics and how the site was used by the people who built it. For now, Rego Grande, which local people already call the Amazonian Stonehenge, remains enigmatic. Pottery shards jut through the soil as if offering tantalizing clues around the place, which has the feel of a contemporary conceptual art piece. Researchers are still trying to determine how Rego Grande fits into the evolving views on the Amazon's human history. Representatives of the Palikur, an indigenous people living in Amapá and French Guiana, have recently stepped forward to say that their ancestors had frequented Rego Grande. Still, archaeologists express caution about establishing such links, emphasizing how much can change in human societies over the span of a thousand years. Ms. Cabral, the archaeologist who has spent years studying Rego Grande, said that evidence of large settlements remains elusive, in contrast with other sites in the Amazon like Kuhikugu, at the headwaters of the Xingu River, where researchers have drawn parallels to the legends surrounding the mythical Lost City of Z, long an irresistible lure for explorers and adventurers. Either way, John McKim Malville, a solar physicist at the University of Colorado who writes extensively on archaeoastronomy, emphasized how the field is moving away from focusing exclusively on astronomical functions to interpretations that are more holistic, by including the ceremonies and rituals of ancient cultures. In that sense, the site in Calçoene offers a beguiling if cryptic glimpse into Amazonia's past. ""The stones of Rego Grande are quite extraordinary and in their irregularity may have their own unique meaning, different from other megalithic sites around the world,"" Mr. Malville said, raising the possibility that Rego Grande reflects the importance in Amazonian cultures of animism, the attribution of a soul to entities in nature and even inanimate objects. He added, ""We can only speculate what its stones mean."""

0,2016-12-15," The New Orleans resident Jared Sternberg, 30, started Gondwana Ecotours in 2013, the same year he graduated from Tulane University Law School in that city. He studied environmental and human rights with the idea of helping indigenous and underserved populations preserve land and resources, but after completing service work in locations including Ghana, Ecuador, Alaska and Nicaragua, Mr. Sternberg became convinced that tourism could achieve the same goals. This year, Gondwana offered trips to six destinations on three continents. (The name Gondwana refers to an ancient landmass.) Below are edited excerpts from an interview with Mr. Sternberg. Q. What inspired the switch from law to tourism? A. After I saw the movie ""Crude,"" about the huge lawsuit by Ecuadoreans against Chevron over contaminating the Amazon Basin, I wanted to do an internship with an Ecuadorean law firm, but everyone turned me down because I didn't have enough experience. I ended up volunteering with the Achuar tribe in the Amazon, which decided ecotourism was the form of development that was right for them. They built Kapawi Ecolodge to protect part of the rain forest and share their culture with visitors. I'm a nature geek and traveled a lot with my family, but I'd never thought about doing anything in tourism. But after being with the Achuar, it just clicked, and I saw the power that tourism can have as a positive force, not only economically but emotionally. How did you get the business off the ground? Starting out, everyone told me it would never work. One guy said, ""There's only one Backroads for every 5,000 new tour companies,"" not that I want to be that big, but it was a good dose of reality. I started with places I'd lived and volunteered, where I knew guides and lodges. We had four trips in 2014, with 24 people, and this year we ran 25 trips for more than 200 people. Travel itself uses resources. How do you mitigate that? One thing I do is pay carbon offsets for my guests' flights. I hope next year to start offsetting the entire trip, from start to finish. A small thing we do that sends out a big message is we provide everyone with a refillable water bottle for the trip. If we have to buy water, we buy jugs. We also try to recycle. How do you share your principles within the trip offerings? In Alaska, for instance, we work with a family that has an off-the-grid sustainable homestead and uses rescue dogs for sledding. We bring people to their house, which I think is more effective than bringing an environmental nonprofit to the B&B for a lecture. We also work with a lot of nonprofit groups and hope to start our own nonprofit foundation. For our tours to Rwanda, we're working with Aspire Rwanda. The women there are learning vocational skills, including cooking. They're going to take our group to the market, we'll buy ingredients for a meal, and they'll teach us how to cook some local dishes. So along with us donating money, my guests will become aware of issues women face in Africa, and the Rwandan women will be able to demonstrate their skills. Do you have a donation formula? So far I've donated about 10 percent of my profits. My goal isn't to say a percentage, but to do what I think is right for a specific trip. What has been your biggest disappointment? Ironically, it's that I can't seem to attract a lot of people to the Amazon trip, which includes time with the Achuar tribe. Having been there and seeing how special it is and not being able to deliver more tourists there — that hurts. I'm just going to keep trying."
1,2016-12-15," Before the premiere of ""The Man in the High Castle"" last fall, Amazon upset New York City subway riders with an advertising campaign that plastered train cars with Nazi imagery. This year, Amazon promoted the series, set in an America under fascist rule, with billboards depicting the Statue of Liberty, her arm thrust out ""Sieg Heil"" fashion. But today it seems quaint to imagine that an ad could be the most disturbing reminder of hate a commuter might encounter. In New York City alone in the weeks since the election of Donald J. Trump, the police reported more than double the number of hate crimes over the same period the year before, particularly against Jews and Muslims. Swastikas with the message ""Go Trump"" defaced a Brooklyn Heights playground. In Washington, white supremacists called out ""Hail Trump!"" and hoisted Nazi salutes. ""The Man in the High Castle,"" which returns with its second season on Friday, depicts an America changed by conquest, not an election, and changed far more starkly. (In its back story, Franklin D. Roosevelt was assassinated, and the United States did not enter the war until too late.) As the internet has taught us, Nazi analogies tend to crush nuance into fine powder. But if it would be hyperbole to treat the series like a documentary, it would be denial to say it plays no differently now than it did before. However hopeful some people may find the election results, there are also bigots who feel validated, for whom the permission to bully and strong-arm was not a sad side effect of the campaign but the whole point. And ""The Man in the High Castle,"" a drama about finding the imagination to resist darkness, has a new relevance, asked for or not. The series, based on a Philip K. Dick novel, is not always up to the challenge, though it has improved. The premiere season, especially its first half, was a marvel of world building in which the character building was an afterthought. Its early-1960s America — a Nazi regime on the East Coast, Japanese occupation in the West and a buffer zone between — was impeccably detailed by the executive producer Frank Spotnitz (""The X-Files""). (Mr. Spotnitz stepped down as showrunner halfway through the second season; because Amazon provided only the first half for review, I can't say if his loss hurt the show.) The visual details are striking (if marred by some plasticky CGI) and the cultural ones are chilling. There's a prime-time Nazi-cop show that normalizes the police state. Bubble-gum pop plays on the radio, while ""Negro"" music is available only via pirate broadcasts from the neutral zone. Hitler's forces have reshaped America not by imposing Teutonic culture on it but by using, or warping, what was already at hand. The new season spotlights the indoctrination of the young. It opens at a Nazi-run school whose classrooms are decked with ""Purity"" posters. Later, Joe Blake (Luke Kleintank), a Nazi agent with a nagging conscience, reads to his son from ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn."" (Key passage: ""What's the use you learning to do right when it's troublesome to do right and ain't no trouble to do wrong?"") The boy is puzzled about Huck's escaped slave friend, Jim. ""How can he be good?"" he asks. ""He's black."" The show falters most with its central couple, Juliana Crain (Alexa Davalos) and Frank Frink (Rupert Evans), lovers drawn by chance into the anti-fascist movement whose relationship has all the zing of a bowl of warm tapioca. The new season finds them separated, which is no great loss and accelerates the story line involving the resistance. The anti-fascists are trafficking a series of mysterious newsreels that depict alternate histories within this alternate history — some record a past in which the Allies won the war, some a future nuclear apocalypse. In Mr. Dick's speculative history, the samizdat material is a book. Changing it into film introduces an element of science fiction or fantasy — the movies are too lifelike to be explained by special effects. Early this season, we meet the ""Man"" of the title — Abendsen (Stephen Root), the scraggly, wild-eyed hermit collecting the films. What are they? Why are they so important? He has few concrete explanations beyond a woolly reference to Carl Jung, and you may wonder if the series' writers have worked one out yet. But the new season does develop the films thematically. They show how circumstance affects morality; the same people can be good in one reel and evil in another, Abendsen says, ""depending on whether they have food in their belly or they're hungry, safe or scared."" Resisting ascendant cruelty, the films suggest, is first a problem of imagination: You have to believe in the seemingly impossible. The series is best at showing pockets of moral struggle within an immoral system. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa gives a delicately calibrated performance as Nobusuke Tagomi, a Japanese trade minister in San Francisco trying to resist the push toward another war. In New York, the American Nazi officer John Smith (Rufus Sewell) confronts the illness of his teenage son, whose life is forfeit under the regime's eugenics laws. The series expands its scope intriguingly (Berlin becomes a significant setting), but it might benefit from setting an endpoint. Stretched out too long, it could become like ""The Walking Dead,"" whose oppressive seventh season, lorded over by the grinning sociopath Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), has felt like a weekly hostage ordeal. Open-ended dystopian-TV series, to paraphrase ""1984,"" risk becoming a boot stamping on a human face, for as many seasons as the ratings hold out. Maybe speaking to extraordinary times is too much burden to place on one middling action fantasy. But ""The Man in the High Castle,"" like Juliana and Frank, did not get to pick the era it lives in. It arrives the same weekend as ""Rogue One,"" the latest ""Star Wars"" movie. That franchise's anti-fascist themes were never subtle. (Hint: Its storm troopers are called ""storm troopers."") Still, Disney's chief executive, Robert A. Iger, felt compelled, in the current climate, to assure fans that the movie contains ""no political statements."" But you can't wish the reminders away. A new ""High Castle"" story line involves a Japanese-American woman who survived the wartime internment camp at Manzanar, in California — one constant, it turns out, between its fictional timeline and ours. On Fox News shortly after the election, a supporter of Mr. Trump defended a proposal to register immigrants from Muslim countries by citing the actual camps as precedent. Against news like that, ""The Man in the High Castle"" seems both a timely provocation and a holdover from another era — an artifact from an alternative timeline in which, if you wanted to ask, ""What would I do if it happened here?"" you had to watch a TV show."
0,2016-12-16," Before the recommendations, an anecdote: Beginning my research for this column, I searched Amazon Video using the term ""Christmas Movies."" About 20 pages in, I saw ""Zombie Lake"" listed. Now, ""Zombie Lake"" is an unusually tatty 1981 film by the director Jean Rollin (whose best work, of which this is not an example, is grisly and poetic with a lot of erotic obsessiveness) about dead German soldiers who rise out of a lake where they'd been dumped by the French Resistance fighters who'd killed them. It is not good (even Rollin nuts rate it low), but I checked it out again to see if there was some Christmas or holiday theme I'd missed before. No dice. There's a brief winter battle scene, atrociously cut into a narrative that takes place largely when trees are in bloom, but that's it. How did Amazon Video wind up recommending ""Zombie Lake"" as a Christmas movie? As I'm new at covering this field, I asked a couple of colleagues if they could steer me to someone at Amazon who could take my question. They responded in a way that struck me as even more curious, acting as if I'd asked them for their credit cards. Some seemed frightened, as if there were somebody at Amazon who, if asked an unpleasant question, had the power to banish you to a cornfield. Eventually one brave soul stepped up, I sent a couple emails, and was put in touch with a very pleasant Amazon rep who commended me for my doggedness in confirming the non-holiday content of ""Zombie Lake."" As this column closes, however, I still await confirmation of my surmise that the presence of the movie was a result of, as plausibility suggests, a glitch in the Amazon search algorithm. In any event, I offer a caveat emptor to users of Amazon Video: If ""Zombie Lake"" comes up on your own search of Christmas or holiday movies, do not be persuaded. It is not a Christmas movie. There are a lot of holiday movies, and there are a lot more Christmas-themed holiday movies than Hanukkah-themed holiday movies (""Eight Crazy Nights,"" 2002, an animated ""tribute"" to Hanukkah that stars Adam Sandler, can be bought starting at $2.99 from iTunes, Amazon, YouTube, Vudu and Google Play, incidentally), and most holiday movies aren't very good. There aren't many as bad as ""Zombie Lake,"" but as we've already established … well, you know. Holiday Classic almost never equals Actual Classic. So here I'd like to recommend a few holiday movies that are at least interesting. This is not the place to debate whether the very good, set-around-Christmas ""Die Hard"" is a holiday movie. I believe that if the filmmakers had intended it as such, John McClane (Bruce Willis) would have made at least one reference to a villain getting coal in his stocking. But that's just me; if you want to watch it as a Christmas movie, you can rent it via Amazon Video or Vudu. One of my own favorite Christmas movies is also R-rated: ""The Ref"" (1994), the Ted Demme comedy about an abrasive thief (Denis Leary) inadvertently falling into the home of a decidedly dysfunctional family (headed by Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis) for the holiday. That picture streams on Netflix, where it is sort-of-hilariously but also accurately categorized under ""Disney Christmas Movies."" (It was theatrically released by the Disney unit Touchstone.) Netflix offers a bounty of the conventionally beloved (which also means widely disparaged) holiday pictures on its streaming service. Yes, there's ""Love Actually"" (2003); the increasingly well-liked ""Scrooged"" (1988) (Bill Murray's latter-day sainthood has done a lot for this picture, which was greeted with tepid reviews on its theatrical release nearly 30 years ago); and the 1954 perennial ""White Christmas."" Starring Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Vera-Ellen and Rosemary Clooney (in a relatively rare film role), this chestnut remains a very relaxed and genteel viewing experience, and has lots of pleasant Irving Berlin tunes. It can be an exceptional holiday decompressant. Amazon's fare is divided into the free stuff — a lot of sappy, made-for-TV dreck mostly — and options to rent or buy, including the original ""Miracle on 34th Street"" (1947) (nice cast, I guess) and the very engaging ""A Muppet Christmas Carol"" (1992). A version of the Alastair Sim version of ""A Christmas Carol"" (1951) is also for rent. Caveat emptor: The ""Miracle on 34th Street"" available free to Prime members is a 1955 television remake reuniting the stars of Hitchcock's ""Shadow of a Doubt"" (1943), Teresa Wright and … Macdonald Carey. (You were expecting Joseph Cotten?) The picture quality is not great. If you're a Prime member, you can get the outré Christmas cracker ""Gremlins"" (1984) free, which is salutary. More cinephile-friendly fare is available on the recently started Filmstruck, naturally. Arnaud Desplechin's sprawling, intense and often hilarious ""A Christmas Tale"" (2008), starring Catherine Deneuve and Mathieu Amalric, is viewable there. (It is also on Hulu.) So is the theatrical cut of ""Fanny and Alexander,"" an Ingmar Bergman picture from 1982. His semi-autobiographical period epic opens with one of the most sumptuous and dramatically vivid Christmas feasts ever filmed. The movie as a whole is one of Bergman's most audience-friendly contrivances. There's also a very unusual picture on Filmstruck: Joseph L. Mankiewicz's ""A Carol for Another Christmas"" (1964), a made-for-TV oddity. It has a nonsensically star-studded cast: Sterling Hayden is lectured by both Ben Gazzara and Steve Lawrence. Britt Ekland has a blink-and-you-miss-it silent cameo. This was actually one of four TV movies commissioned by the United Nations to foster the notion of world peace. Rod Serling's script recasts Dickens's ""A Christmas Carol"" to teach its own Scrooge (here named ""Grudge"" and played by Hayden) to stop worrying and love international cooperation. It plays pretty much exactly as you'd expect a Rod Serling version of ""A Christmas Carol"" to play. It's spectacularly dated (although Peter Sellers's work as a future demagogue has a certain timeless quality), but if you want to boggle your movie-buff kin, this will do the trick. The Warner Archive site has a couple of Christmas movies for the cinema cultist. There's ""Holiday Affair"" (1949), which posits a romance between Robert Mitchum and Janet Leigh after they indulge in some holiday-shopping department store intrigue. Frank Tashlin's ""Susan Slept Here"" (1954), narrated by an Oscar statuette, sees the screenwriter Dick Powell hosting the juvenile delinquent Debbie Reynolds over the Christmas holiday, much to the consternation of Powell's bombshell girlfriend, Anne Francis. It's not the most wholesome entertainment — there are a lot of jokes pertaining to the actual legality of the Powell-Reynolds romance, given that her character is underage — but it is perhaps the most candy-colored Christmas movie ever made, which is not nothing."
1,2016-12-16," BERLIN — Robert Gentz stepped off an Air Berlin plane in Beijing with the goal of conquering online fashion in China. By the time he boarded his return flight to Berlin, he had a new plan: to copy it. Mr. Gentz, a 34-year-old German who is a co-founder of Zalando — a European clone of Zappos, the online American shoes and fashion retailer owned by Amazon — held meetings in the fall of 2013 with Chinese and international fashion labels, online stores and other parts of the local e-commerce industry. He wanted to expand his company into the world's largest digital market. But after the meetings, Mr. Gentz decided China's approach to online fashion was far ahead of anything available elsewhere. He marveled at how Chinese consumers freely chatted with — and bought from — brands and stylists on WeChat, a local internet messenger, while online retailers, independent delivery companies and fashion houses routinely joined forces. ""We wanted to take that experience back to Europe,"" Mr. Gentz said. This holiday season, Zalando, which is Europe's biggest digital fashion player, is using a made-in-China approach to take on Amazon, just as the American giant is looking to cement its place as the world's dominant e-commerce company by expanding aggressively into the Continent's still-fragmented world of digital fashion. Few companies have been able to keep Amazon — the largest online fashion seller in the United States — at bay after it enters a new market. The notable exception is in China, where rivals like Alibaba, the world's second-largest online seller by market value, have been able to hold their ground. For decades, tech companies have taken their cues from Silicon Valley. But Zalando's approach of borrowing from its Chinese counterparts represents a new strategy of looking East, not West, for inspiration. In overhauling its successful European online fashion store into a digital platform, Zalando differs from others trying to match Amazon and its logistics and technological prowess. The German company previously focused on handling all sales and inventory itself. But in addition to selling directly to consumers, it now wants to remake itself into a digital shopping mall, allowing fashion houses and retailers to make sales as well, often with limited input from Zalando. These efforts, roughly a year in the making, may foster a rare European tech player able to give Silicon Valley heavy-hitters a run for their money across the region, still one of the world's largest — and most profitable — markets. ""If you want to be the dominant player in a geographical area, you need to go beyond being just a traditional e-commerce player,"" said Erik Mitteregger, a board member at Kinnevik, a Swedish investment firm that was an early Zalando investor and still owns a 32 percent stake. ""It's a necessary move."" Zalando's inspiration from China, though, comes with challenges. Despite domestic dominance, Chinese players like Alibaba have yet to successfully replicate their business model overseas. Online shopping habits in Europe also are somewhat different from those in China. And Amazon and European competitors, including ASOS and Yoox Net-a-Porter, may yet outmuscle Zalando with their traditional takes on e-commerce. For most Americans — and even some Europeans outside its core German-speaking markets — Zalando is not a household name. It began in 2008 as a Berlin start-up founded by Mr. Gentz and David Schneider, two business school graduates who once tried — and failed — to build a Latin American rival to Facebook. By 2014, Zalando had become the largest public offering in the European tech sector since 2000. It counts Rocket Internet, a Berlin incubator known for copying successful online business ideas, and DST Global, a backer of Facebook, Twitter and Alibaba, among its early investors. To meet the needs of Europe's national markets, Zalando has tweaked its offerings. In Germany, where few people use credit cards, consumers can pay with an online service linked to their bank accounts after receiving clothes in the mail. In Italy, it worked with a local delivery company so people wary of goods not arriving could pay in cash upon receipt of their orders. While European competitors have also earned loyal followings, Zalando remains the largest, both by market valuation and total online sales, according to Euromonitor, a data provider. It is expected to double its yearly pretax earnings this year, to $220 million, and revenue is likely to jump more than 20 percent, to $4 billion, according to an average of equity analysts' estimates. ""Zalando is well placed to be a leading fashion platform in Europe,"" said Andrea Ferraz, a Morgan Stanley analyst in London. Still, the company remains a relative minnow — its $9.5 billion valuation is one-fortieth that of Amazon. And Europe's fast-growing online fashion market, estimated to be worth $75 billion, has not gone unnoticed by e-commerce giants. Alibaba has hired local country managers and brought its payment service to Europe, mostly to serve Chinese visitors. Amazon has opened a fashion studio in London and joined the British Fashion Council to bolster its local credibility. To compete with Amazon and others, Zalando has spent heavily on a network of logistics hubs that dot the European landscape. On the outskirts of Erfurt, a sleepy German town, orange boxes filled with designer dresses and shoes scuttled along miles of conveyor belts, while workers on push-scooters sped through Zalando's first custom-built logistics warehouse, now the size of 18 football fields. Four more — from Italy to Germany — are up and running, and new sites are planned outside Paris and, potentially, near London. And just like Amazon, the company has been accused of mistreating some of its workers, complaints Zalando executives acknowledge they could have handled better. As part of its overhaul, Mr. Gentz gathered his management team soon after Zalando's I.P.O. in 2014, outlining the steps needed to become a digital hub for all things fashion. For one, it is combining its logistical expertise with that of big brands and mom and pop stores all over Europe. The goal, executives say, is to use Zalando's website and smartphone application as a platform to sell goods either from its warehouses or directly from fashion houses themselves, giving customers greater choice and flexibility. Adidas, for instance, allows people to buy its items through Zalando's platform, even though the final sale may come directly from the German sports brand's stock (Zalando takes a commission). The relationship now includes same-day deliveries — the fastest, in Berlin, took just 24 minutes — from some of Adidas's German stores. ""No one else offers this level of partnership,"" said Roland Auschel, Adidas's head of global sales, who first discussed stronger ties with Zalando during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The e-commerce company has also offered up its in-house advertising team. That includes testing an online marketplace where Zalando connects fashion houses with ""online influencers,"" or personalities with large social media followings. For Nicolas Borg, a Zalando strategy executive who previously worked at eBay, the next stage will most likely be chatbots, or humanlike interactions powered by artificial intelligence, to offer fashion advice to consumers on the likes of Facebook Messenger. ""In the future, what will matter is not where the purchase happens, but how you can influence it,"" Mr. Borg said. ""That is our biggest challenge,"" he added. ""How do we change the online experience?"""
0,2016-12-23," You've seen Stephen Root far more than you might think. He's the shape-shifting character actor you know you recognize, but can't place. Of course, there's his unforgettable creation from the cult classic ""Office Space"": Milton, the stapler-obsessed arsonist hidden under extremely thick glasses, stilted speech and a pocket protector. But Mr. Root has mined a number of idiosyncratic veins over the past several decades, with memorable parts in films like ""No Country for Old Men,"" TV shows as disparate as ""NewsRadio, ""Louie"" and ""Boardwalk Empire,"" and voice work in animated ones like ""King of the Hill"" and ""Adventure Time."" Now, he's the title character in Season 2 of Amazon's ""The Man in the High Castle,"" a series based on the Philip K. Dick novel that imagines an America occupied by Nazis and the Japanese empire after losing World War II. A mysterious hermit in a fancy robe, the character is responsible for the central plot point: a series of contraband films depicting alternative realities that Hitler obsessively watches. ""Fear and violence,"" Mr. Root's character says in the season premiere. ""It's who we are."" Sound familiar? Over the phone from Sherman Oaks, Calif., Mr. Root, 65, discussed the show's timely appearance and the enduring appeal of red staplers. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.  How did you prep for ""The Man in the High Castle""?  I grew up reading Arthur Clarke, and Ray Bradbury and Clifford Simak, and all these guys including Philip K. Dick — but I had never read that book, which kind of astonished me. When Frank Spotnitz [the show's creator] called, I did not get a chance to read it until after I'd shot the first episode. So I had to go completely by the script.  There's a lot of dialogue in the series that could be applied to this year in America. It's prescient. It makes this season's premiere more interesting for a lot of people, because it is a show about living within a totalitarian regime, which we are not in, but it's certainly a sea change from what we've been living under.  The season's premise is also resonant with the rise of fake news and CNN chyrons that would have been jokes on ""The Daily Show"" six months ago. It is like living in an alternate reality, which this show is. We want to impress that upon everyone, that we're doing a show that is set in an alternate reality. It almost seems like we're in one as well in real life.  Each of your characters has a distinctive physicality. Do you spend a lot of time people-watching? Absolutely! That's one of the things I love about being in New York. In Los Angeles, you're in your spaceships, driving around in your car, and you don't get to people-watch. The subway is the greatest people-watching place of the century. That's exactly what you do as a character actor. When I'm with a group of [character actors], and we're out, we'll see people and go, ""Yeah, that's a guy I'm going to do."" Put him in a permanent library of your memory.  Will you get off at their stop and tail them? No, but will I go over and start listening to them, and maybe go an extra stop or so, just to get it? Yeah, I've done that.  Was Milton the result of a person you saw in public?  Not really. Mike Judge [the writer and director of ""Office Space""] had done a sketch of Milton, had done the voice himself when we were at Fox. He took several of us from ""King of the Hill"" and a couple other people over to read the script of ""Office Space."" He was going to read the voice himself, but then he decided literally as we were walking over: ""Root, you read it."" I went, ""Well, thanks for the prep, Mike."" [Laughs] And while [in his version] he had a whiny voice, that's not what I heard when I was reading the script. I heard him with a lisp.   It's almost as if you can't hear him sometimes. That was actually direction from Mike! As Milton is pushed farther and farther into the bowels of the building, Mike wanted him to get softer and softer. So by the time he's sitting in the dark, you can barely hear him. Which I think is brilliant.  Do you get a lot of people coming up to you talking about staplers? Almost exclusively. [Laughs] When I did a [theater] show in New York, I would have Milton people outside for a least a couple days a week. I've gone on to sets before, and there's a tray of staplers waiting for me. I'm so happy that it's a little movie that resonates with people. There are always going to be cubicles. The computers will change, but it's the same mentality."
0,2016-12-25," SAN FRANCISCO — Jeff Bezos of Amazon, along with a couple of his rivals, may eventually control much of the $1 trillion global market for business computers and software. That is because Amazon Web Services, his big-business computing division, is starting to affect more than just the world of computer servers, data storage and networking at the core of computing. Increasingly, it is also entangled with mobile phones, sensors and all sorts of other devices in the so-called Internet of Things. It's the same story at Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform, the other two big cloud companies. Start-ups and giant corporations rent the core resources, along with related software, instead of owning and running their own machines. What's next? As innovations like artificial intelligence and connected devices become popular, customers are putting cloud components in mobile computing, home games and email marketing campaigns. In other words, the big clouds aim to be everywhere. ""When has Amazon ever thought about anything other than world domination?"" said Lydia Leong, who follows cloud computing at Gartner. Not content to be in big centralized data centers, she said, ""they want to be at the edges, whether that is a customer's own computers or the Internet of Things."" This aim for domination was clear at Amazon's big customer conference, called Re:Invent, which was held in Las Vegas this month. About 32,000 people went to the fourth annual event. In one talk at the conference, an Amazon Web Services executive showed off the company's 8,700-mile undersea cable, part of an A.W.S. global network that each day adds computing power equal to that inside a Fortune 500 corporation, and spoke about this expansion. He talked about crushing the costs of servers and networking, most likely sad news for old tech giants that make those things, like Dell and Cisco. In a nice bit of showmanship during the main keynote, Andy Jassy, the head of A.W.S., appeared onstage with an 18-wheel truck carrying a device that could suck 100 petabytes of data out of a customer's computers and put it in the Amazon cloud. That is equal to two billion filing cabinets of paper, which a surprising number of companies now possess in digital form, thanks to things like video and sensors. Put that together with some software Mr. Jassy talked about that would be on chips made by Intel but capable of gaining access to the A.W.S. cloud, and you get the picture: There isn't a part of computing Amazon doesn't want to touch. It is easy to see why this matters to Amazon. In the third quarter, A.W.S. had revenue of $13 billion a year, growing at 55 percent annually. A.W.S. was 10 percent of Amazon's revenue, but more than 100 percent of the company's operating income. Amazon's international retail business lost money, and United States retail sales are nowhere near as profitable. Amazon says it is hardly moving away from a core business of providing large-scale computing, but rather finding more ways to sell stuff related to it by moving to edge devices. ""We see it less as a move from one to the other, and more of an extension,"" an Amazon spokeswoman, Mary Camarata, wrote in an email Saturday. ""We have an enormous number of customers excited about leveraging the capabilities."" But Amazon is not alone in this business, and the competition is getting more intense. A.W.S. now has 81 services, including ways to work on home video games. Microsoft's 67 services include Internet of Things ""hubs"" and email marketing campaigns. Google has 53, including ways to deploy mobile software globally and steer performance with data analysis. Comparisons of services are difficult, as one company's service may encompass two or three offered by another. Machine learning — a method for computers to gain knowledge without being programmed with that information — is front and center for Alphabet's Google, said Urs Hölzle, the head of technical infrastructure at Google Compute. Google has recently shown off its own global network of submarine cables, along with local devices like cloud-connected office whiteboards. Over the next year, Mr. Hölzle said, Google will open about one new Compute facility a month. Building out across the globe, with sometimes $1 billion or more in a facility, is critical in some cases to meet local data regulations. Equally, the big cloud companies all want to be as close to customers and their devices as possible. ""Global proximity is a huge advantage,"" said Corey Sanders, the director of program management at Azure. ""This is a way to transform your business, including the way devices on the edge act."" There are profound consequences from the scale and ambition of this trend. Given their size, wealth and technical expertise, the big cloud companies are likely to build cheaper designs and demand lower prices for everything in computing. Who is to say they don't affect the devices themselves? That is starting to dawn on the rest of the industry. On the first day of Re:Invent, Mr. Jassy had a private lunch with about 10 venture capitalists. It is an annual affair, where he indicates where A.W.S. is going, and they figure out how to make money from it. ""He wasn't explicit, but if you were hoping to invest in storage, computing — anything below applications — you are hosed,"" said Dharmesh Thakker, a partner at Battery Ventures, who attended the lunch. ""Andy is smart and approachable, but reading between the lines, I'm not sure this is good for the V.C. ecosystem."""
0,2016-12-27," Walmart Stores' tortoise-like digital pace may yet pay off. The retailer is making some strides with its e-commerce efforts as sales increase. Walmart's $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com in August will accelerate the push to compete with Amazon. Patchy customer service and a brick-and-mortar image are some of the remaining hurdles to the plodding retailer's online success. Walmart's chief executive, Doug McMillon, has made internet sales a priority after earlier efforts to kick-start growth fell flat. The Jet.com founder Marc Lore — now Walmart's head of e-commerce — had the right ambition. He planned to compete with Amazon on price, but hit a speed bump after Jet was forced to drop its annual membership fee shortly after its start. Still, Mr. Lore's past success with the sale of the company behind Diapers.com to Amazon shows he knows how to get the online giant's attention. Jet is already helping bolster sales. Digital revenue jumped 20 percent year-over-year in the three months ended in October, nearly double the 12 percent growth notched in the previous quarter, before Walmart closed the Jet deal. Along with buying Jet, Walmart took a 10 percent stake in China's JD.com and may be eyeing a similar deal with Flipkart of India. It is targeting a 20 to 30 percent compound annual growth rate in e-commerce over the next three years as it prioritizes online sales over new store openings. Any growth will be from a low base, however. Online revenue represents about 3 percent of some annual $480 billion in top line. There are other points of weakness, too. Amazon is easier to use, with better shipping options and the world's biggest online inventory. Walmart scores lower on WPP's BrandZ list of the most valuable global brands, notching at No. 32 versus Amazon's seventh place. The Alphabet unit Google places first. The survey also showed Walmart lagging Amazon in customer service in important categories like electronics. That's important: A separate analysis found that the top 30 brands in 2016 outperformed the global MSCI index over the last five years. With Jet's charismatic founder now sweating such details, Walmart's attempt to catch up to Amazon should gather pace in 2017."
0,2016-12-29," In a move that promises to raise new questions about electronic privacy, detectives investigating a murder in Arkansas are seeking access to audio that may have been recorded on an Amazon Echo electronic personal assistant. So far, the online retail giant has resisted demands by the police and prosecutors in Bentonville, Ark., for the information. Without addressing the specifics of the case, Amazon said in a statement that, as a matter of course, it ""objects to overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands."" The tug of war over access to the audio, which was reported by the website theinformation, began when the police started to investigate the death of Victor Collins, who was found on Nov. 22, 2015, in a hot tub at the home of James Bates, according to court records. Investigators discovered signs of a struggle, including spots of blood, broken bottles and pieces of the spa that were on the ground. Detective Cpl. Josh Woodhams of the Bentonville Police Department wrote in an affidavit that he found an Amazon Echo on the home's kitchen counter. The voice-activated device has seven microphones, and is equipped with sensors to hear users from any direction up to about 20 feet. Among other things, it can play music, make to-do lists, stream podcasts and provide real-time news and information. In February, Mr. Bates was charged with murder, and as part of the investigation, the police sought from Amazon ""electronic data in the form of audio recordings, transcribed words, text records and other data"" captured by the Echo. The request has raised concern among some right-to-privacy supporters. Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said in an email that there should be a ""clear legal standard that governs law enforcement access"" to machines that make up what has become known as the internet of things. The reference is to the constellation of devices — such as cameras, cellphones and appliances — connected to the internet. But Lynn Terwoerds, the executive director of the Executive Women's Forum, which founded and sponsors the Voice Privacy Alliance, said in an email that the request for the information was built on a faulty premise. She said the Echo is always listening for a ""wake word"" — Alexa, Amazon or another customizable term — and records only what is said after it has been activated. She said it has 60 seconds of recorded sound in its storage. ""What this 'always listening' means is that the device is not eavesdropping and interpreting everything you're saying,"" Ms. Terwoerds wrote. Once it detects the wake word, according to Amazon, the Echo starts streaming audio to the cloud, where it is secured until the customer permanently deletes it. The case raises ""serious privacy concerns with this kind of nonspecific warrant,"" Ms. Terwoerds said, adding, ""We have to fight against the myth of Echo listening in on our every word and sending that data to Amazon — it's simply untrue."" Jon Simpson, the police chief in Bentonville, which, by car, is about three hours northwest of Little Rock, referred questions to Nathan Smith, the prosecuting attorney in Benton County. In an email, Mr. Smith said Amazon had yet to fully comply with two requests, although he said it had provided ""some very limited subscriber information."" The company said in a statement that it would not ""release customer information without a valid and binding legal demand properly served on us."" Mr. Smith said that officers had followed the proper procedure in seeking a search warrant from a judge based on probable cause, and that he hoped Amazon would comply and that no further steps would be necessary. While many right-to-privacy supporters have expressed interest in the request, Mr. Smith said the case was "" really about seeking justice for the victim."" He added that it was the responsibility of the police to seek the data to determine its relevance to the investigation. A lawyer for Mr. Bates did not respond to an email and a phone call seeking comment. The Arkansas case is reminiscent of an episode in which the federal government sought to legally compel Apple to unlock an iPhone used by a gunman in a shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., last year that killed 14 people. The case became contentious as Apple refused to assist the authorities, prompting a debate about whether privacy or security was more important. Federal officials said in March that they found a way to unlock the phone without help from Apple. The lack of clear-cut legislation over who is legally entitled to the data from such devices means these kinds of cases will continue to surface, Mark A. Testoni, the president and chief executive of SAP National Security Services, which helps agencies track those suspected of terrorism through open source data, said in an interview. ""It's such a massive gray area,"" he said."
0,2016-12-30," Run-DMC, the '80s hip-hop group, wants its brand back. Darryl McDaniels, also known as DMC and a founding member of the rap trio, filed a $50 million lawsuit in the Southern District of New York on Thursday saying that retailers including Amazon and Walmart are infringing on the Run-DMC logo for products that have not been authorized by the group. According to the suit, the sellers ""are trading on the good will"" of the Run-DMC name, which has generated $100 million in revenue since the 1980s, by ""advertising, selling, manufacturing, promoting and distributing multiple products,"" including T-shirts, hats, patches, wallets and sunglasses. Amazon and Walmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In its day, Run-DMC — which also included Joseph Simmons (or Reverend Run) and Jason Mizell (Jam Master J) — was known for a distinct visual style, from the instantly recognizable red-and-white box logo to its members' black fedoras or bucket hats, Adidas gear, square glasses and thick gold rope chains. With hits including ""It's Like That,"" ""My Adidas"" and ""Walk This Way,"" the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2009."
1,2016-12-30," While we wait for television shows to return from holiday hiatus, let's check out films that have been added to streaming platforms. ""The Accountant,"" a quiet thriller starring Ben Affleck, is on iTunes. And Amazon Prime offers ""Love Is Strange,"" Ira Sachs's touching portrait of lifelong love.  THE ACCOUNTANT (2016) on iTunes. This crime thriller, in which Ben Affleck stars as Christian Wolff, an autistic office drone who moonlights as a forensic accountant and launderer for drug cartels, is bizarrely quiet for such an intriguing premise (not to mention an A-list cast that also includes Anna Kendrick, J. K. Simmons and Jeffrey Tambor). Once we find out about the protagonist's side gig, ""you may anticipate scenes of Christian consorting with international outlaws and leading a glamorous double life,"" Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. ""But no — there aren't any first-class jaunts to exotic foreign capitals, and no scenes of him being wined, dined and entertained by strippers amid piles of cocaine. He is a tormented loner.""   LOVE IS STRANGE (2014) on Amazon Prime. Ira Sachs, a treasure among chroniclers of modern gay life in film, directed this touching story of New York real estate and lifelong love. John Lithgow and Alfred Molina star as Ben and George, a longtime couple who are finally able to marry once it is legal — but who find their lives uprooted once George loses his job at a Roman Catholic school over his sexuality. They are forced to give up their comfortable apartment, and what follows is a somewhat mute, yet profound examination of relationships in all their forms. ""The impact of the final scenes — tears are highly probable — comes from the curious, cumulative sense of intimacy,"" A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. ""By the time the movie is over, you feel as if the people in it were friends you know well enough to tire of, and to miss terribly when they go away."" THE EIGHTIES on Netflix. CNN's seven-part documentary series about the 1980s provides a panoramic portrait of the decade, with topics including Ronald Reagan's two-term presidency, the AIDS crisis and the twilight of the Cold War. THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA (2006) 5:17 p.m. on Bravo. Anne Hathaway is the hero of this delightful comedy about ambition and power, but her fellow cast members — Meryl Streep as her menacing boss, Stanley Tucci as her protector and Emily Blunt as her co-worker and peer — are the real stars. ""Ms. Hathaway, even made over with shiny bangs, flawless makeup and toe-squeezing footwear, is nowhere near as interesting to watch as Mr. Tucci, who has never been better, or Ms. Streep, whose perfectionism has rarely seemed so apt,"" A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. Nor does she hold the screen against Ms. Blunt, Mr. Scott added, ""whose portrayal of Emily, Miranda's senior minion and Andy's office rival, is a minor tour de force of smiling hostility.""
