0,2017-01-01," The gentle piano music starts as the doorbell chimes. A white-haired Christian pastor greets his friend, a Muslim imam, and the two converse and laugh over a cup of tea, wincing about their creaky knees as they prepare to part ways. Later, it spurs the same idea in each for a gift: kneepads sent via Amazon Prime. (It is a commercial, after all.) The piano notes accelerate as the men open their deliveries with smiles, and then each uses the item to kneel in prayer: one at a church, the other at a mosque. The final chords fade. The ad from Amazon and its message of interfaith harmony became a viral sensation this holiday season, at the end of a year in which talk involving Muslims became particularly ominous. Amazon — which aired the commercial in England, Germany and the United States — cast a practicing vicar and Muslim community leader in the lead roles and consulted with several religious organizations to ensure the ad was accurate and respectful. ""This type of a project is definitely a first for us,"" said Rameez Abid, communications director for the social justice branch of the Islamic Circle of North America, one group Amazon worked with. ""They were very aware that this was going to cause controversy and might get hate mail and things like that, but they said it's something that they wanted to do because the message is important."" A slew of major American brands — including Honey Maid, Microsoft, Chevrolet, YouTube and CoverGirl — prominently featured everyday Muslim men, women and children in their marketing last year. While such ads were apolitical in nature, focused on themes of community and acceptance, they were viewed as bold, even risky, in a year when there were campaign statements by Donald J. Trump about a Muslim registry and a ban on Muslim immigrants. It was ""a glimmer of hope in the midst of a greatly traumatic year for Muslims,"" said Mona Haydar, an American poet and activist who appeared in a recent Microsoft commercial with a variety of community leaders, including a transgender teenager and a white policeman. ""For me as a Muslim woman, I represent something right now in the country that for some people incites fear,"" said Ms. Haydar, 28, who wears a hijab and hails from Flint, Mich. ""This normalizes the narrative that we are just human beings."" Several advertising executives likened the movement to the decision by mass marketers to cast same-sex couples and their children in ads for the first time in 2013 and 2014, making inclusion and acceptance a priority over potential criticism from some customers. ""With the kind of gay parent issue, we've gotten a little closer to acceptance, but the Muslim issue in America is still pretty raw for a lot of people,"" said Kevin Brady, an executive creative director at the ad agency Droga5, which worked last year with Honey Maid on a commercial about white and Muslim-American neighbors. ""I don't think it should be, but it's one that I think brands took an extra step of courage to really go out there with in 2016."" A campaign for YouTube Music in the middle of last year highlighted five individuals, including a young woman in a hijab, rapping to a song by Blackalicious while walking through a school corridor. The inclusion of the ad, ""Afsa's Theme,"" was purposeful, said Danielle Tiedt, the chief marketing officer at YouTube, adding that highlighting diversity is ""more important than ever."" ""I don't think diversity is a political statement,"" she said. ""This is an issue of universal humanity."" For its ad, Amazon was painstaking in its attention to detail, checking with religious groups about costuming and background imagery, and sending over final proofs of the ad for review, said Mr. Abid and Antonios Kireopoulos, an associate general secretary of the National Council of Churches, another group Amazon consulted. Ads showing any kind of racial diversity can now attract heaping amounts of vitriol online — most of it delivered anonymously — as State Farm discovered last month when it posted an ad of a black man proposing to a white woman on Twitter. Anti-Muslim remarks, like ""they don't belong here,"" peppered the comments under Chevrolet's video in June of two twins from Los Angeles, named Ruqaya and Qassim, who were accepted into a soccer program the company sponsors. They were 8 years old when the video, which did not mention religion, was made. Mr. Brady said the agency had prepared Honey Maid for potentially hateful responses to its ad, though it fielded fewer than he feared. (On Facebook, the top comments are appreciative and heartfelt.) Nida'a Moghrabi, a cheesecake seller and mother of three daughters who starred in the commercial with a neighbor she befriended a few years ago, said she had initially been irritated by some rude comments on Facebook and YouTube until she realized how ubiquitous such remarks were. ""If you go to the adoption commercial from Honey Maid, you still see nasty comments,"" Ms. Moghrabi said, referring to an ad of a child talking about his new brother. ""So I was like, if they're complaining about adopted kids, of course I'm not going to worry about their comments about me."" The response from her community was positive, she said. Such ads are ""encouraging for the younger generations, like those who are afraid to mention that they're Muslims,"" she added. ""My daughters are more confident now, and I believe their friends who are Muslims, they know that we're accepted and we're loved."" With more Americans dwelling in siloed information bubbles, commercials have the potential to reach audiences with diverse viewpoints. Amazon said its ad had aired during programs including the ""Today"" show, ""Empire"" and ""Blue Bloods,"" while Microsoft said its placements had included ""The Voice,"" ""Pitch"" and ""This Is Us."" Dr. Kireopoulos said he had first seen the commercial outside work while watching a National Football League game on television, giving him hope that many different audiences will see it and consider the message, particularly as reports of hate crimes against American Muslims rise. ""I imagine the violence will unfortunately continue, so it will take more vigilance on the part of community leaders and everyday believers to work together,"" he said. Ms. Haydar is hopeful about the potential. ""In 10 years, this commercial might have lived on in the heart of some young kid who saw a Muslim woman in a commercial and didn't see the boogeyman in my face, and instead saw a normal human being,"" she said. ""Then if somebody says something about Muslims that's kind of crazy, maybe that kid can say, 'I saw this commercial, and she actually just seemed kind of normal.' You don't know what the reverberations look like."""
0,2017-01-02," RIO DE JANEIRO — A prison riot involving gangs vying for supremacy over the cocaine trade in the Brazilian Amazon left at least 56 people dead, the authorities in the city of Manaus said on Monday. Riots at Brazil's prisons are common, but the episode in Manaus, which involved decapitated bodies being thrown over the walls of the penitentiary, ranks among the bloodiest in recent decades. Officials expressed dismay over the scenes of slaughter in the Compaj prison, which held more than 1,200 inmates, about triple its official capacity. ""I never saw anything like this in my life,"" Judge Luís Carlos Valois, who helped negotiate an end to the riot, said in a Facebook post. He said that dozens of people had been killed, but that it was challenging to arrive at a precise count: ""There were lots of bodies. Many of them were dismembered."" The riot flared on Sunday and lasted about 17 hours, raising fears of even greater violence on the streets of Manaus, the largest city in the Amazon basin with a population of about 2.1 million. Manaus has emerged as a brutal battleground between two prison gangs that are contesting control of the drug trade in the region. The authorities said that one of the gangs, Familia do Norte (Family of the North), which operates from the Manaus prisons, was responsible for the vast majority of the killings during the riot. The targets were from First Capital Command, a much larger rival gang commonly known by its Portuguese initials, P.C.C., which has its roots in the prisons of São Paulo in southeast Brazil. ""There were deaths only on one side,"" Sérgio Fontes, the top security official in Amazonas State, told reporters. ""The Familia do Norte massacred members of the First Capital Command, and one or another guys who weren't on their good side at the moment."" The riot drew comparisons with the 1992 uprising at the Carandiru prison in São Paulo, when police forces stormed the building and 111 inmates were killed. An appeals court recently voided the convictions of 73 police officers for their participation in the killings, raising criticism from human rights groups. Since that episode, the Brazilian authorities have vowed to alleviate overcrowding in the country's prisons and combat prison gangs. But soaring numbers of convictions for relatively minor drug offenses have pushed prison populations upward, the gangs' clout is growing, and riots continue to erupt frequently all over the country. In the riot in Manaus, inmates took dozens of fellow prisoners hostage. They also seized 12 employees of Umanizzare, a private contractor that operates prisons in the Amazon. Negotiators eventually won the release of the hostages by assuring the inmates that they would not be harmed or transferred to other prisons. Security specialists say that Brazil could experience more riots like the one in Manaus as P.C.C., the São Paulo gang, extends its reach around the country. Familia do Norte, the Manaus gang, recently formed an alliance with Red Command, a gang that has been losing ground to P.C.C. in parts of Rio de Janeiro."
0,2017-01-04," Software has started writing poetry, sports stories and business news. IBM's Watson is co-writing pop hits. Uber has begun deploying self-driving taxis on real city streets and, last month, Amazon delivered its first package by drone to a customer in rural England. Add it all up and you quickly realize that Donald Trump's election isn't the only thing disrupting society today. The far more profound disruption is happening in the workplace and in the economy at large, as the relentless march of technology has brought us to a point where machines and software are not just outworking us but starting to outthink us in more and more realms. To reflect on this rapid change, I sat down with my teacher and friend Dov Seidman, C.E.O. of LRN, which advises companies on leadership and how to build ethical cultures, for his take. ""What we are experiencing today bears striking similarities in size and implications to the scientific revolution that began in the 16th century,"" said Seidman. ""The discoveries of Copernicus and Galileo, which spurred that scientific revolution, challenged our whole understanding of the world around and beyond us — and forced us as humans to rethink our place within it."" Once scientific methods became enshrined, we used science and reason to navigate our way forward, he added, so much so that ""the French philosopher René Descartes crystallized this age of reason in one phrase: 'I think, therefore I am.'"" Descartes's point, said Seidman, ""was that it was our ability to 'think' that most distinguished humans from all other animals on earth."" The technological revolution of the 21st century is as consequential as the scientific revolution, argued Seidman, and it is ""forcing us to answer a most profound question — one we've never had to ask before: 'What does it mean to be human in the age of intelligent machines?'"" In short: If machines can compete with people in thinking, what makes us humans unique? And what will enable us to continue to create social and economic value? The answer, said Seidman, is the one thing machines will never have: ""a heart."" ""It will be all the things that the heart can do,"" he explained. ""Humans can love, they can have compassion, they can dream. While humans can act from fear and anger, and be harmful, at their most elevated, they can inspire and be virtuous. And while machines can reliably interoperate, humans, uniquely, can build deep relationships of trust."" Therefore, Seidman added, our highest self-conception needs to be redefined from ""I think, therefore I am"" to ""I care, therefore I am; I hope, therefore I am; I imagine, therefore I am. I am ethical, therefore I am. I have a purpose, therefore I am. I pause and reflect, therefore I am."" We will still need manual labor, and people will continue working with machines to do extraordinary things. Seidman is simply arguing that the tech revolution will force humans to create more value with hearts and between hearts. I agree. When machines and software control more and more of our lives, people will seek out more human-to-human connections — all the things you can't download but have to upload the old-fashioned way, one human to another. Seidman reminded me of a Talmudic adage: ""What comes from the heart, enters the heart."" Which is why even jobs that still have a large technical component will benefit from more heart. I call these STEMpathy jobs — jobs that combine STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) skills with human empathy, like the doctor who can extract the best diagnosis from IBM's Watson on cancer and then best relate it to a patient. No wonder one of the fastest-growing U.S. franchises today is Paint Nite, which runs paint-while-drinking classes for adults. Bloomberg Businessweek explained in a 2015 story that Paint Nite ""throws after-work parties for patrons who are largely lawyers, teachers and tech workers eager for a creative hobby."" The artist-teachers who work five nights a week can make $50,000 a year connecting people to their hearts. Economies get labeled according to the predominant way people create value, pointed out Seidman, also author of the book ""How: Why How We Do Anything Means Everything."" So, the industrial economy, he noted, ""was about hired hands. The knowledge economy was about hired heads. The technology revolution is thrusting us into 'the human economy,' which will be more about creating value with hired hearts — all the attributes that can't be programmed into software, like passion, character and collaborative spirit."" It's no surprise that the French government began requiring French companies on Jan. 1 to guarantee their employees a ""right to disconnect"" from technology — when they are not at work — trying to combat the ""always on"" work culture. Leaders, businesses and communities will still leverage technology to gain advantage, but those that put human connection at the center of everything they do — and how they do it — will be the enduring winners, insisted Seidman: ""Machines can be programmed to do the next thing right. But only humans can do the next right thing."""
0,2017-01-05," SEATTLE — Amazon is bringing one of its experiments in brick-and-mortar retailing to New York. Barricades went up several days ago outside a retail space in the high-end mall at the Time Warner Center in Manhattan, with a sign saying an Amazon bookstore would open there soon. On Thursday, an Amazon spokeswoman, Deborah Bass, confirmed that the company would open in a space previously occupied by an Armani Exchange. The Manhattan location, with an opening planned for the spring, will be the eighth that the internet giant has opened or announced. Stores in or near Portland, San Diego and Seattle are open now, and Amazon has said it is working on stores in Chicago and Dedham, Mass., near Boston. On Thursday, it updated its listing to include future stores in Lynnfield, Mass., and Paramus, N.J. The plans for an Amazon store in the Time Warner Center were first reported by The Wall Street Journal. While Amazon has conquered the online shopping market — accounting for 38 percent of e-commerce sales in the United States during the recent holiday season, by one estimate — it has taken a cautious approach to physical retail, where its presence is small. The company's strength online and its willingness to test concepts in brick-and-mortar shopping has stirred speculation that it could upend how products are bought and sold in physical stores. The company recently opened a convenience store, Amazon Go, in Seattle that allows customers to grab soft drinks, sandwiches and other food from shelves and leave without visiting a cash register. Shoppers gain entry to the store with a smartphone application, and are charged for items using sensors and other technologies similar to those in self-driving cars, Amazon has said. Amazon is expected to test another concept this year that would add a twist to online grocery shopping, a market in which the company has shown a growing interest. While Amazon already delivers groceries directly to homes through fleets of delivery trucks in Los Angeles, Seattle and other cities, the stores to be tested would have customers place orders online and pick them up by pulling into parking stalls. Two such stores are under construction in Seattle, according to documents filed with the city's planning department and two people with knowledge of the effort who asked for anonymity because the plans were confidential. Amazon has declined to discuss the stores. At first glance, Amazon's bookstores appear to be more conventional, with rows of shelves and nooks for reading. The company stocks far fewer titles than typical bookstores, using online data to determine which ones to carry."
1,2017-01-05," EVERY once in a while, just for laughs, Kevin Smith-Fagan tries to call a friend of his, Priscilla, using the voice-recognition system in his 2013 Chevrolet Volt. ""I've tried it so many times and it never gets it right,"" said Mr. Smith-Fagan, an executive at a public television station in Sacramento. ""It always thinks I'm saying 'Chris,' and I have like five people named Chris in my phone book, so it's always interesting to see who's getting the call."" Voice control systems have been in cars for more than a decade, and great strides have been made in the technology's ability to understand human speech. But many people still find these systems too unreliable, or annoying, to use for more than the most simple tasks, like ""Call Mom."" That isn't stopping auto and tech companies from trying to give drivers the ability to do even more things by talking to their cars — while keeping their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel. The efforts have some added urgency now, as states pass stricter laws aimed at curbing distracted driving. Under a California law that went into effect Jan. 1, holding or operating a phone while driving is now prohibited. This week at the International CES, the giant electronics conference in Las Vegas, Ford Motor announced that owners of its cars would soon be able to use Amazon's Alexa voice-activated assistant in their vehicles. Drivers will be able to ask for a weather report, stream music from Amazon Music or add appointments to their calendars. They will also be able to use Alexa from home to start or unlock their cars remotely. But the automaker also envisions drivers using Alexa to help with other tasks — like shopping on Amazon. Stuck in traffic? You can take care of Valentine's Day by saying, ""Alexa, order flowers on Amazon."" Other companies are moving in the same direction. Apple's Siri can be used to control iPhone functions in cars, and Apple's CarPlay software allows drivers to dictate text messages while driving, as well as program destinations into Apple Maps and have the route plotted on the car's display. Google's Android Auto can do the same. In the last year, carmakers like BMW, Mercedes-Benz and General Motors have also introduced improved voice-recognition systems that can understand normal spoken words for many tasks. Older systems required drivers to learn specific commands. With newer models, owners can program in a destination just by saying the address, as if speaking to another person. In older cars, the state, city and street had to be given separately, one at a time — and if you were lucky, each was correctly understood. While more advanced systems like Alexa will make it easier for drivers to use voice commands, there are still hurdles. The biggest is just changing habits, and persuading people to try talking to their cars. On the day before Thanksgiving, Frank Krieber bought a 2016 Dodge Challenger, granite gray, with a 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 engine, and the latest version of the Uconnect infotainment system. A few days later, when he set off on a road trip to Florida from his home in Michigan, he synced his phone to the car, but didn't bother to use the voice-recognition capabilities to enter destinations or handle other tasks. ""I probably should use it, but it's just easier to put in an address manually, so I haven't really played around with it,"" said Mr. Krieber, a sales executive for a computer company. ""My experience so far has been, when you tell it to do something, it doesn't do what you want."" Older cars used voice-recognition systems that were built into the car and had limited computing power and memory. Now that more and more cars have wireless connections, the voice-recognition processing can be done via the internet in distant computers and servers, what the tech industry calls the cloud. That is an advantage that Ford sees in using Alexa, said Don Butler, Ford's executive director for connected vehicle and services. ""If you have the voice recognition done outside the car, people will see a much greater ability to interpret normal, everyday speech,"" he said. With Alexa, a user will need to download an Alexa app to a phone and carry the phone in the car, creating the connection with the cloud. Ford and Amazon have also developed a way to get Alexa to work seamlessly with a Ford car's own built-in entertainment and navigation systems. Alexa will first be available in a few months in battery-powered and hybrid models like the Focus Electric and Fusion Energi, and later in other Ford models. ""You can ask Alexa where the nearest Starbucks is, and have her program the address into the Ford navigation system for you,"" Mr. Butler said. For Amazon, the collaboration with Ford is another illustration of a broader push by technology giants to push their versions of voice assistants, which are made to perform simple tasks like turning on lights at home, playing music and fetching sports scores from the internet. Apple was an early entrant into the market with its Siri assistant for iPhones. Google has its Assistant and a new connected speaker featuring the voice technology called Google Home. And Samsung, which has announced plans to buy the audio and automobile technology company Harman International Industries, last year agreed to acquire a voice assistant start-up, Viv Labs. Many analysts believe Amazon has vaulted to a leadership position in the race with the surprise success of the Echo family of smart speakers. While Amazon does not reveal sales figures for its devices, the company recently said that the Echo speaker and a smaller device called Echo Dot were the best-selling products on Amazon last year. Amazon has been more aggressive than other tech giants in getting other companies like Ford to integrate Alexa into their products. Dozens of other companies were expected to announce plans at CES to allow people to control their devices using Alexa. The satellite television provider Dish Network said people who use its Hopper digital video recorders would be able to use Alexa voice commands to change channels and play movies. Lenovo, the computer maker, announced its own Alexa-based speaker, Lenovo Smart Assistant. The maker of Seiki, Westinghouse Electronics and Element Electronics televisions said it would build Alexa into the remote controls for some 4K sets from those brands. In California, Mr. Smith-Fagan would welcome better voice recognition. ""With the new law we have, I'm kind of worried, because everyone's going to have to find a way to use the phone without touching it with your hands,"" he said."
0,2017-01-06," In the retail-store slump, Jeff Bezos may be holding a Trump card. Amazon.com, the e-commerce giant he runs, is considering a bid for the bankrupt American Apparel, according to a Reuters exclusive, just as Macy's and other department stores are losing sales and cutting staff. A deal could be a handy way to show a president-elect suspicious of Silicon Valley that thousands of working-class jobs are being saved. This would not be the main reason for Amazon to pounce on American Apparel, whose brand proudly emphasizes that it makes all its clothing in a Los Angeles factory employing 4,500 people. The business would be a natural fit with the Amazon's in-house fashion offerings that started last year, and with earlier acquisitions like Shopbop and Zappos. Still, the acquisition might have the added benefit of assuaging Donald J. Trump. The president-elect and the tech industry disagree on everything from encryption and free trade to immigration. Mr. Trump singled out Amazon during his campaign for criticism over antitrust issues, saying the company would have ""such problems"" if he captured the White House. Mr. Bezos also personally owns The Washington Post, which has been a vocal critic of the incoming president. Now Mr. Trump is using Twitter to threaten companies he sees as doing wrong — whether it is Boeing, assailed for overcharging on Air Force One, or the likes of General Motors and Toyota, taken to task for potentially moving American jobs abroad to save money. Buying American Apparel could help make Mr. Bezos a savior of a dying industry. Macy's and Kohl's on Wednesday reported November and December sales that were worse than expected, wiping 14 percent off Macy's valuation and 19 percent off Kohl's on Thursday. Macy's plans to close several locations and slash more than 10,000 jobs, or 7 percent of its work force. At the same time, digital retail sales are expected to reach more than $500 billion by 2020, a third higher than 2016 estimates, according to Forrester Research. And Amazon already owns 60 percent of the pie. A deal would not cost much, either: American Apparel currently has an offer from Gildan Activewear for just $66 million. And Amazon's avowed and proved lack of interest in short-term profit means it should have no problem keeping the retailer's jobs stateside. Brandishing some ""Made in the U.S.A."" credibility would be a smart bet by Mr. Bezos."
1,2017-01-06," They say talk is cheap. In tech right now, it is also very valuable. As Neal Boudette and Nick Wingfield report, Ford Motor Company is working with Amazon to allow Alexa, Amazon's voice-activated virtual assistant, to work inside Ford's vehicles. That would require downloading an app and carrying a smartphone in the car. It would enable drivers to do things like get weather reports, stream music, juggle their calendars or remotely lock and unlock their cars. And, of course, shop on Amazon while driving. Other tech companies are also getting into using ""conversational computing,"" or voice commands, in cars. Apple has CarPlay software for dictating messages or getting map directions while behind the wheel. Google has Android Auto for something similar. Amazon really seems to be pulling out the stops to connect people to cloud-based services, though. The Ford announcement was made at International CES, where Alexa appeared in a number of other devices. Lenovo announced an interactive speaker, similar to Amazon's Echo, which also uses Alexa technology. Whirlpool's appliances are to be integrated with Alexa, so you can just tell your dishwasher to get going. In all, there seemed to be more than a dozen companies with Alexa capabilities at CES. Notably, Huawei, a Chinese electronics company, said its flagship Mate 9 phone would have Alexa preinstalled. That's particularly impressive, because the Mate 9 uses Google's Android operating system and thus has access to Google Voice, a voice assistant. That's not all. At last month's Amazon Web Services cloud computing conference for software developers, there were several sessions on how companies could put Alexa in even more places. There appears to be a race to dominate conversational computing, and Amazon is eager to be ahead. That means you're likely to hear the conventional Alexa voice — educated, female and professionally friendly — in even more places. Why the big push now? ""If you own the voice-user interface, you own lots of data, and you know what people are talking about. That gives you a much better chance of selling them something,"" said Patrick Moorhead, the president of Moor Insights & Strategy, a tech analyst. ""It's also a Trojan horse for getting people to use A.W.S."" (Amazon Web Services is by far the most profitable part of Amazon.) User data, direct digital knowledge of what people are doing with your products and in the world, is perhaps the most valuable currency in a world dominated by online life. It is the best way to know how your products are going over, and what to build next. Amazon collects lots of shopping data from its retail website, and now has the most information on how people use cloud computing systems like A.W.S., but it has an uneven record in many other areas. Its phone was a dud, and it has a relatively modest business in tablets mostly used for reading. It has no operating system of its own to speak of, and that is often how companies like Apple and Google obtain some of their best data. If the company can capture voice computing, it can gain lots of insights without having to build lots of low-margin hardware. Easy to see why the push is on."
0,2017-01-10," SEATTLE — Over the years, Sonos has weathered competition from better known rivals like Apple and Bose to find a devoted audience among audio enthusiasts. But lately its wireless speaker has lost ground to an unexpected competitor, Amazon's Echo. Now it faces another challenge: a change in the corner office. After 14 years leading the company he helped found, John MacFarlane has resigned as chief executive of Sonos and has been replaced by one of his deputies, Patrick Spence. Mr. MacFarlane, 50, has also left the company's board of directors, though he will remain an employee to help mentor colleagues and work on other projects. He said he left the board so Mr. Spence would not feel like he was always looking over his shoulder. ""I don't want to be that founder who's always second-guessing,"" Mr. MacFarlane said. Sonos is a rarity among technology companies, started in 2002 at a time when independent hardware companies in consumer electronics, an industry dominated by much bigger players, were hard to find. Mr. MacFarlane did not take venture capital money for several years and kept the company private, shunning the usual routine of selling shares to the public or being acquired by a bigger company. Sonos — based hundreds of miles away from the glare of Silicon Valley in the seaside town of Santa Barbara, Calif. — does not have the visibility of an Apple, Facebook or Uber. But it has amassed a loyal following with its family of wireless speakers, which allow people to play music streamed from internet services like Spotify or stored on a local computer. One of the secrets to Sonos's business is that once listeners become hooked on the sound from one of the company's speakers, they tend to buy more of them so they can simultaneously play music in multiple rooms in their homes. Sonos would not disclose its sales, but it said there are millions of homes with its speakers in them, many of them with more than one speaker. Mr. MacFarlane previously said that the company's 2015 sales were around $1 billion. Mr. Spence, who was previously president and chief commercial officer at Sonos, said the company is profitable. Mr. MacFarlane said he had planned to resign as chief executive earlier, citing his wife's bout with breast cancer and his aging parents as factors. But last year he delayed his plans when Amazon's Echo speaker unexpectedly began to eat into sales of Sonos speakers. While Echo has received mixed reviews for its sound quality, its Alexa voice assistant — which allows people to quickly play music with verbal commands — has captivated the tech industry and the public. More recently, Google introduced its own Echo competitor, Google Home, with a voice assistant. ""I fell into that trap where I've been watching voice recognition for years,"" Mr. MacFarlane said. ""I tried Echo in the beginning and wrote it off. I had too many distractions at that time. I wasn't playing at the level I should have been playing at in all frankness."" Last March, Mr. MacFarlane announced layoffs at Sonos and said the company was investing in efforts to bring voice recognition to its products. Sonos has since said it is working with Amazon to allow people to control Sonos speakers with Alexa. Mr. MacFarlane said the company is in a better place than it was last year. The growth of streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music, both of which work with its speakers, has helped stoke demand for Sonos products. The company said the number of households with Sonos speakers grew 20 percent this past holiday quarter from the same period the previous year. Mr. Spence, 42, said Sonos understands that its competition is no longer strictly the audio companies that it faced before. ""With what Amazon and Google are doing, the world has changed completely,"" he said. ""We're part of that new world."""
0,2017-01-12," At some point during the year and a half since Amazon first posted the pilot of ""Sneaky Pete,"" an appealing new series available on Friday, a few changes crept into the episode. It's hard to pinpoint them all, because the original pilot isn't around for comparison. But the scene in which the famously rare bourbon Pappy Van Winkle is drunk out of paper cups is definitely new. It's an insignificant and yet telling detail. Fans of smart, literate, light-footed television with a sense of place, loosely housed in the crime genre, will know that Pappy was one of the motifs of the late, lamented ""Justified,"" which ended its run on FX in 2015. Then they'll connect the dots to Graham Yost, who developed ""Justified"" — and who joined ""Sneaky Pete"" after the original pilot was shot. So is ""Sneaky Pete"" — the story of a con man who passes himself off as the long-lost grandson of a family that runs a Bridgeport, Conn., bail-bond shop — going to be ""Justified North""? The four episodes Amazon made available don't answer that question definitively, though what they do show us is a little alarming: The pilot is still the best thing about the show by far. Written by David Shore (""House""), whom Mr. Yost replaced as showrunner, the first episode deftly sets up a tricky situation and introduces us to the characters with a low-key, disarming sense of humor. The Pete of the title is actually Marius (Giovanni Ribisi), who has just spent three years in prison, listening to his cellmate Pete's stories of his idyllic childhood. Marius needs to hide from a murderous gambler (Bryan Cranston, who created the show with Mr. Shore), so he decides to pull off his most challenging con yet: showing up at Pete's old home and convincing the family that he's the grandson and cousin they haven't seen in 20 years. The story runs along the channels you'd expect, and there are dangerous shoals of sentimentality: Marius-Pete, whose own childhood was harrowing, finds himself falling for his new family and will have to decide whether to stick to his plan of fleecing them and disappearing. It all works in the pilot because the characters are convincingly human, and the cast, including Mr. Ribisi, Margo Martindale, Peter Gerety and Marin Ireland, is excellent. Ms. Martindale, as the grandmother, plays yet another matriarch who's charming on the outside, scary on the inside, but it never grows old. Of course, one of her most notable performances in such a role came in ""Justified."" That overlap is coincidental, but after the pilot episode, other ""Justified"" actors start to appear, including Jacob Pitts, Brad William Henke and Karolina Wydra. Casting, in general, continues to be a strength, with Jay O. Sanders, Michael O'Keefe, Kevin Chapman and Alison Wright (Martha in ""The Americans"") popping up. But the mood of the series changes after the pilot; a show that was distinctive for being relaxed and amiable starts to feel a little more forced and artificial. A certain amount of theatricality worked for Mr. Yost in ""Justified,"" which was partly a comedy of Southern manners. But it isn't working yet in ""Sneaky Pete."" Some of the new characters, like a parole officer who's aggressive in his efforts to empower ex-cons, aren't convincing, and an eight-minute monologue for Mr. Cranston's character that's meant to be a tour de force lands awkwardly. Perhaps by the end of the season, Mr. Yost and his crew (Episodes 2 through 4 were all written by former ""Justified"" writers) will have successfully remolded ""Sneaky Pete,"" and the cast makes it worth watching in any case. In the meantime, we can toast the promise of the pilot with some Pappy Van Winkle."
1,2017-01-12," In 2016, the corporate PACs associated with Microsoft, Facebook, Google and Amazon broke ranks with the traditional allegiance of the broad tech sector to the Democratic Party. All four donated more money to Republican Congressional candidates than they did to their Democratic opponents. As these technology firms have become corporate behemoths, their concerns over government regulatory policy have intensified — on issues including privacy, taxation, automation and antitrust. These are questions on which they appear to view Republicans as stronger allies than Democrats. In 2016, the PACs of these four firms gave a total of $3.6 million to House and Senate candidates. Of that, $2.1 million went to Republicans, and $1.5 million went to Democrats. These PACs did not contribute to presidential candidates. The PACs stand apart from donations by employees in the technology and internet sectors. According to OpenSecrets, these employees gave $42.4 million to Democrats and $24.2 million to Republicans. In the presidential race, tech employees (as opposed to corporate PACs) overwhelmingly favored Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. Workers for internet firms, for example, gave her $6.3 million, and gave $59,622 to Trump. Employees of electronic manufacturing firms donated $12.6 million to Clinton and $534,228 to Trump. Most tech executives and employees remain supportive of Democrats, especially on social and cultural issues. The Republican tilt of the PACs at Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Facebook suggests, however, that as these companies' domains grow larger, their bottom-line interests are becoming increasingly aligned with the policies of the Republican Party. In terms of political contributions, Microsoft has led the rightward charge. In 2008, the Microsoft PAC decisively favored Democrats, 60-40, according to data compiled by the indispensable Center for Responsive Politics. By 2012, Republican candidates and committees had taken the lead, 54-46; and by 2016, the Microsoft PAC had become decisively Republican, 65-35. In 2016, the Microsoft PAC gave $478,818 to Republican House candidates and $272,000 to Democratic House candidates. It gave $164,000 to Republican Senate candidates, and $75,000 to Democratic Senate candidates. Microsoft employees' contributions followed a comparable pattern. In 2008 and 2012, Microsoft workers were solidly pro-Democratic, with 71 percent and 65 percent of their contributions going to party members. By 2016, the company's work force had shifted gears. Democrats got 47 percent of their donations. This was not small change. In 2016 Microsoft employees gave a total of $6.47 million. A similar pattern is visible at Facebook. The firm first became a noticeable player in the world of campaign finance in 2012 when employees and the company PAC together made contributions of $910,000. That year, Facebook employees backed Democrats over Republicans 64-35, while the company's PAC tilted Republican, 53-46. By 2016, when total Facebook contributions reached $3.8 million, the Democratic advantage in employee donations shrank to 51-47, while the PAC continued to favor Republicans, 56-44. While the employees of the three other most valuable tech companies, Alphabet (Google), Amazon and Apple, remained Democratic in their giving in 2016, at the corporate level of Alphabet and Amazon — that is, at the level of their PACs — they have not. Google's PAC gave 56 percent of its 2016 contributions to Republicans and 44 percent to Democrats. The Amazon PAC followed a similar path, favoring Republicans over Democrats 52-48. (Apple does not have a PAC.) Tech giants can no longer be described as insurgents challenging corporate America. ""By just about every measure worth collecting,"" Farhad Manjoo of The Times wrote in January 2016: These firms are now among the biggest of big business. In a 2016 USA Today ranking of the most valuable companies worldwide, the top four were Alphabet, $554.8 billion; Apple, $529.3 billion; Microsoft, $425.4 billion; and Facebook, $333.6 billion. Those firms decisively beat out Berkshire Hathaway, Exxon Mobil, Johnson & Johnson and General Electric. In addition to tech companies' concern about government policy on taxation, regulation and antitrust, there are other sources of conflict between tech firms and the Democratic Party. Gregory Ferenstein, a blogger who covers the tech industry, conducted a survey of 116 tech company founders for Fast Company in 2015. Using data from a poll conducted by the firm SurveyMonkey, Ferenstein compared the views of tech founders with those of Democrats, in some cases, and the views of the general public, in others. Among Ferenstein's findings: a minority, 29 percent, of tech company founders described labor unions as ""good,"" compared to 73 percent of Democrats. Asked ""is meritocracy naturally unequal?"" tech founders overwhelmingly agreed. Ferenstein went on: One of the most interesting questions posed by Ferenstein speaks to middle and working class anxieties over global competition: There was a large difference between tech company officials, 73 percent of whom chose free trade and less regulation, while only 20 percent of Democrats supported those choices. Ferenstein also found that tech founders are substantially more liberal on immigration policy than Democrats generally. 64 percent would increase total immigration levels, compared to 39 percent of Democrats. Tech executives are strong supporters of increasing the number of highly trained immigrants through the HB1 visa program. Joel Kotkin, a fellow in urban studies at Chapman University who writes about demographic, social and economic trends, sees these differences as the source of deep conflict within the Democratic Party. In a provocative August, 2015, column in the Orange County Register, Kotkin wrote: The tech elite, Kotkin writes, ""far from deserting the Democratic Party, more likely will aim take to take it over."" Until very recently, the Kotkin sees future partisan machination in cynical terms: In 2016, Donald Trump has produced an upheaval within the Republican Party that shifted attention away from the less explosive turmoil in Democratic ranks. Hillary Clinton's failed bid to finesse the inherent conflict between her dependence on corporate contributions and her need for a strong turnout by union workers, minorities and idealistic millennials embodies the Democratic Party's long term struggle. High tech and virtually every other special interest poured money into her campaign: finance, insurance and real estate, $115.4 million; communications/electronics, $59.6 million; lawyers and lobbyists, $41.5 million; organized labor, $35.2 million – the list goes on and on. The public, at least for the moment, is not willing to support the continued compromise of principle that has been a hallmark of both parties. Trump has provided a temporary solution for the Republican Party; the Democrats need to find a legitimate and more lasting one."
0,2017-01-13," Amazon's new warehouse in Baltimore is a rare economic bright spot there, employing 3,000 people full-time in a city ravaged by poverty and a lack of opportunities for less educated workers. And with Amazon's announcement Thursday that it plans to hire 100,000 new employees in the next 18 months, the Baltimore facility and at least 70 other Amazon fulfillment centers across the country stand to be among the biggest beneficiaries. Fifteen miles away in the suburbs, all that is left of Owings Mills Mall is rubble, demolition having started in the fall, after the last anchor stores, Macy's and J. C. Penney, closed within months of each other. The contrast between the two scenes is an example of what the economist Joseph Schumpeter termed ""creative destruction,"" the inevitable process in which new industries rise and replace old ones. But creation tends to get more press than destruction, and the announcement from Amazon is no exception. The company's hiring plans are certainly good news. But to understand the forces roiling the American economy, it's key to remember that online retailing has destroyed many times that number of positions at malls and shopping centers across America. That's not necessarily a bad thing over the long term. Greater productivity is essential for economic growth, and, according to the company, the 100,000 figure includes highly paid engineers and software developers in addition to hourly warehouse workers. But for people caught on the wrong side of that transition in the short term, it's the equivalent of an economic hurricane. ""There are huge benefits to consumers from Amazon,"" said Lawrence Katz, an economics professor at Harvard who studies labor and technological change. ""But the workers they are hiring aren't the same ones being laid off."" Even since New Year's Day, the traditional retail sector has absorbed more blows. Macy's said last week that it would eliminate 10,000 positions, and the Limited announced this week that it would close all 250 of its stores, eliminating 4,000 jobs. The Amazon announcement comes as the company is introducing automation that could one day cost jobs. It uses robots in many of its warehouses, though it says they work in conjunction with people instead of replacing them. Moreover, with the rise of automation, the future of once-solid trades like truck driver and delivery worker is in doubt, threatened by the likes of driverless cars and drones. And that has prompted an intense debate among economists and some policy makers about just what society and especially government owes these workers. One place to start, Mr. Katz said, would be for the government to provide more funding for retraining and also develop a wage insurance program to cover differences in salaries as workers migrate to new, lower-paid jobs from disappearing, higher-paid ones. ""The economy as a whole gains from creative destruction, but we don't put many resources into training displaced workers,"" he added. ""That's a real problem, and in practice, we need to do much more."" The half-full glass in all of this is greater productivity — an economic force that has been otherwise lacking during the recovery from the Great Recession, said Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at J. P. Morgan. Productivity in the retail sector, online and offline, jumped 3 percent in 2015 compared with a measly 0.8 percentage point for business over all, he said. The typical online retailer generates $1,267,000 in sales per employee versus $279,000 at bricks-and-mortar stores. Along with making online retailers much more efficient, that difference also helps explain why Amazon is a stock market darling while Macy's and J. C. Penney are laggards. ""You can't complain about low productivity and then complain about job reallocation in the same breath,"" Mr. Feroli said. Still, a lot of jobs are being reallocated in a fairly short time, in an economy that has only begun to pick up speed recently for many Americans. Mr. Feroli calculates that if it were not for online retailers, of which Amazon is by far the biggest, there would be 1.2 million more retailing jobs in the United States. There are 16 million retail workers in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a figure that includes online sellers like Amazon and traditional stores. In the last four years, traditional retailers have cut more than 200,000 jobs, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a Chicago outplacement firm. The seasonal bump in store hiring, a familiar economic story each fall, is also ebbing, according to Challenger. During the holiday shopping season last year, stores added 100,000 fewer temporary workers than in 2013. ""The number of jobs we are losing in retail outpaces the number being created in the sectors that are taking their place,"" said Andrew Challenger, vice president of the firm. For example, transportation firms and warehouses are hiring, but not as quickly as bricks-and-mortar stores are laying off workers, he said. Many of the jobs included in the figure Amazon announced on Thursday had already been disclosed by the company, which routinely reveals how many people it plans to hire in different localities when it opens new fulfillment centers. The company has become far more vocal about telling its employment story over the past half-decade, which is partly a reflection of the rapid expansion of its network of warehouses devoted to packaging and shipping products to customers. The expansion began in earnest around 2011, when Amazon began hammering out agreements with state governments to collect sales tax from Amazon customers in those states. At the same time, Amazon decided to make fast shipping a priority, something possible only if it opened more warehouses closer to where customers live. The 100,000 hires it plans for the next 18 months represent a 56 percent increase in the 180,000 full-time United States employees it had at the end of 2016. Amazon has more than 300,000 full- and part-time employees globally. That attention could be politically beneficial for Amazon as Donald J. Trump assumes the presidency. Last year during the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump singled out Amazon and its founder, Jeff Bezos, as having a ""huge antitrust problem."" Mr. Trump suggested that Mr. Bezos was using his ownership of The Washington Post to discourage political scrutiny of Amazon. But Mr. Bezos was among a group of technology-sector executives who met with Mr. Trump last month, and after Amazon's announcement of its hiring plans on Thursday, Mr. Trump's press secretary said ""the president-elect was pleased to have played a role in that decision."" Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment. Amazon has said that its employment figures alone do not capture its full effect on jobs. On Thursday, the company said its marketplace business, through which independent merchants sell goods on the company's site, sustained 300,000 additional jobs in the United States. In the meantime, a new open-air shopping center is planned for the vast rubble-strewn site in Owings Mills, Md., where shoppers once flocked to Macy's and J. C. Penney. The demolition should wrap up by spring, although no date has been set for the opening of the new mall, nor have tenants been announced."
0,2017-01-14," The book was a gift, a dark joke uncovered on Amazon, purchased by one co-worker for another. I saw it while fumbling through invoices in the office: ""How to Date a White Woman: A Practical Guide for Asian Men."" ""This book is wild."" I said. ""Steve has a chance now!"" screamed Joe. For those still wondering, yes, Joe, myself and Steve are all Asian-American men. Steve had just been on his first date with a complicated, whole human being who happened to be white and female. Joe, in all his excitement for Steve, decided to roast him by purchasing a used copy of the book for $20. I took a photo, posted it on Instagram, and some 8,000 likes later the book price shot up to over $500 on Amazon, since there were only five copies available. There were over 500 comments on the photo as well, but unanimously no one actually believed the book to be of any utility outside being a gag gift. Asian World Press published the book in 2002. If you go to their web 1.0 site, you'll see it is the only book shown among dead links for construction, business and travel guides. Asian World Press feels like an accident and the book a severe miscalculation. But even if we agree that publishing a dating book pegged specifically to Asian men who want to date white women is unconscionable in 2002 — and much more so in 2017 — there are still people who believe Asian men are inept and undesirable to any women outside their race. Steve Harvey is one of these people. On Jan. 6, Steve Harvey did a roundup of dating books on his talk show, displaying an image of the cover of ""How to Date a White Woman,"" and said the book could be only one page long: "" 'Excuse me, do you like Asian men?' 'No.' 'Thank you.' "" He then asked an imaginary black woman if she liked Asian men, and acted out her response: ""I don't even like Chinese food, boy. It don't stay with you no time. I don't eat what I can't pronounce."" As my therapist would say, I have a lot of ""feeling"" about his sentiments. Before ever reading about the history of discrimination against Asian-Americans — from the ""yellow peril"" to the Chinese Exclusion Act to the Japanese-American internment camps to the model minority myth to Vincent Chin and Pvt. Danny Chen – every Asian-American man knows what the dominant culture has to say about us. We count good, we bow well, we are technologically proficient, we're naturally subordinate, our male anatomy is the size of a thumb drive and we could never in a thousand millenniums be a threat to steal your girl. As a kid, you believe the things you're told about yourself. But as I grew, I started to see things unravel. I wasn't subordinate, I didn't count good, I hated bowing, and outside downloading GIFs of Daisy Fuentes, I was terrible with computers. My first reaction, and the reaction of everyone at Chinese language school as well, was that I was defective and destined for life on a rack at T.J. Maxx begging to get chosen despite my imperfections. So many Asian-Americans I grew up with bought into the expectations the dominant culture placed on them and did everything they could to meet them. I recognized from a young age that I couldn't and began to plan for life on the margins. I realized that people on the margins aren't afforded the privilege of being complicated, whole, human beings in America; we have to create that existence ourselves, and it is that experience that I feel fundamentally binds us. Over time, I began to find solidarity with my singularity and difference. Yet the one joke that still hurts, the sore spot that even my closest friends will press, the one stereotype that I still mistakenly believe at the most inopportune bedroom moments — and I know Joe and Steve do as well — is that women don't want Asian men. Attractiveness is a very haphazard dish that can't be boiled down to height or skin color, but Asian men are told that regardless of what the idyllic mirepoix is or isn't, we just don't have the ingredients. That doesn't mean we give up. Steve goes to the gym; Joe buys every piece of Supreme clothing he can afford; and I've got jokes. They're the cultural modifications we see as antidotes to our issues with masculinity. But no matter how successful I was, how much self-improvement was made, or how aware I was that stereotypes are not facts, there were times I thoroughly believed that no one wanted anything to do with me. I told myself that it was all a lie, but the structural emasculation of Asian men in all forms of media became a self-fulfilling prophecy that produced an actual abhorrence to Asian men in the real world. That's why this Steve Harvey episode is so upsetting. He speaks openly about issues facing the black community, he is a man of God, and he has a huge platform to speak from. Unfortunately, he's also the type of guy who orders Krug champagne for himself and Cook's for every one else. For his own personal profit, he's willing to perpetuate the emasculation of Asian men regardless of how hypocritical it is. He isn't the only one doing this in 2017, but as I told myself on New Year's, I'm not drinking anymore of this Cook's they're trying to pour, and neither should you."
0,2017-01-16," It started around the holidays. My eyes began to dart involuntarily to call-outs of my name on social media. ""Just ask Alexa,"" the tweets read. ""Designed around your voice for hands-free convenience. Ask Alexa!"" No. I ask you — this real Alexa asks you — when did possessing hands become inconvenient? Amazon has installed Alexa, its voice recognition and natural-language platform, inside more than five million Echo units the company has sold since introducing the microphone-and-speaker device two years ago. When an Echo's microphones hear the name Alexa, the device wakes and records your questions and commands. You can operate any Alexa-enabled device — in your home, office or car — with this ""voice-controlled computer in the cloud."" You can use Alexa to order a car service or food delivery, or to book travel. You can also tell Alexa to buy other Amazon products, or to play audiobooks and music. Footnote: If you request Billy Joel's ""The Downeaster 'Alexa,' "" however, she may stop herself mid-stanza when she hears her name and record you singing instead. The growing popularity of Alexa means we may scarcely have to talk to a human again. And, on command, she talks back: Alexa will tell you the solution to math problems or measurement conversions. Have a general knowledge query? Alexa will read you the first line of the relevant Wikipedia entry. But why ""Alexa""? Alexa is a truncated, feminine form of the masculine Greek name Alexandros, or Alexander, and means defender or, more aptly in this case, helper of man. Amazon's senior vice president, David Limp, told Fortune magazine last year that the name was ""important"" for the ""personality that it creates around the persona"" of the service. For Amazon (not coincidentally perhaps, also a female warrior tribe in Greek mythology) to ascribe the feminine gender to its personal assistant platform conforms to that equally ancient stereotype of a deferent subject catering to the needs of her master. But — just my luck — it was the rarity of my name that led Amazon computer scientists to adopt it as the ""wake word"" for their voice-controlled bot. As Mr. Limp explained, ""the phonics of that word and how that word is parsed and the fact that it has a hard consonant with the X in it is important in making sure that it wakes up only when it's asked for."" The letter ""x"" occurs only once among the top 100 American names of the last century, in the masculine form, Alexander. Since 1880, it is estimated that fewer than 100,000 American women have been named Alexa. Amazon's goal is to establish a pervasive voice-activated consumer network that fits seamlessly into users' lives. In addition to making several of its own gadgets Alexa-compatible, Amazon has licensed other companies to incorporate the platform in their products. The Ford Motor Co. will offer Alexa in three automobile models starting this month. There is a darker side to Alexa. The conversational platform aims to become so natural that we'll barely notice she's listening at all. Every time an Echo records our voice, Alexa stores the sound file in the cloud. Amazon has said that it ""will not release customer information without a valid and binding legal demand properly served on us."" But already, in December, prosecutors in Arkansas subpoenaed a murder suspect's Echo information. It remains to be seen whether courts will force Amazon to release all the data Alexa may have recorded. Amazon's promise is that Alexa is ""always getting smarter."" Through big data collection and analytics, she will come to know us in ways we can't even know ourselves. My worry is that she will make this Alexa dumber. The platform offers endless choices, virtual connections and access to a world of information, but what this major-domo of the ""internet of things"" may deliver is reductive banter, mindless consumerism and a universe of trivia. And Alexa may not be the only one adapting. We talk to Alexa in the peremptory tone we reserve for barking at chat bots, snarkily dismissing interlopers in our social media feeds, or frustratedly answering staccato telephone menu trees. People do not talk to their dog the way they speak to Alexa. Imperturbably obedient by design, Alexa appears to offer us a new level of control and choice, always on demand. The miracle of convenience allows us to romanticize this unilateralism to operate everything from our light bulbs, security systems, thermostats, music and media with a simple voice command — even as we disengage from people and depersonalize the institutions that enable real connection and collective agency. We think we're making the robots in our image, but perhaps they're making us in theirs. That's what it seems like, if you ask me."
0,2017-01-17," The Sears Holdings Corporation, which is projected to lose more than $2 billion this year, is in the retailing dead pool. As its prospects for a turnaround appear to grow dimmer, it may seem to be another morality tale for bricks-and-mortar retailers in the age of Amazon. Yet it is a lesson that even Sears recognizes. Like other retailers, the company is scrambling to adapt to today's internet market. The question is whether it can do so before its cash runs out and the deal-making of its hedge fund chief executive, Edward S. Lampert is not enough to create more. Everyone knows Sears, which has been around for over 130 years. It started as a catalog business, the Amazon of a century ago, where you could buy just about anything. And I mean anything. I lived for several years in a Sears catalog home, shipped to my town by Sears at the turn of the 20th century. But in recent years, Sears has struggled. The company has lost over $9 billion in the last five years. Since 2011, it has shut more than 150 of its big Sears stores and over 350 Kmart stores, and it has just announced the closing of another 150 stores. Its revenue has fallen to a projected $25 billion in 2016, from $42.6 billion in 2011, according to Standard & Poor's Global Market Intelligence. The outlook is grim for Sears. This month, the company said that comparable sales had declined by 12 to 13 percent over the holiday shopping season. Its stock price has fallen to $8.75, from a high of over $190. Amazon, in the meantime, has soared. Its revenue is on track to reach $136 billion in revenue this year, according to S.&P. Global Market Intelligence, up over 30 percent from the previous year. Amazon has a market value of $395 billion as it dominates internet retail. And Amazon is on a roll, not just with sales but also with new products like the Echo that are must-haves, at least if you want your children to be screaming for Alexa to play Disney tunes all day. Other bricks-and-mortar retailers are struggling as well because of the Amazon juggernaut. Macy's has announced store closures and a revenue decline. J. C. Penney has reported disappointing sales. Still, Sears is a special case. Since 2008, it has been directly run and at times aided by Mr. Lampert. Despite a decade of decline, Mr. Lampert — who is after all a person who can read numbers even if he seldom leaves his compound in Florida — still seems to believe in a future for Sears, whose headquarters is in the Chicago suburbs. What is he up to? Mr. Lampert's hedge fund acquired Kmart out of bankruptcy and combined it with Sears. At first, it looked like a miracle as the stock and sales rose. But the financial crisis was grim for Sears. Over the years, Mr. Lampert has managed the company directly — some say micromanaged — by dividing managers into segments and pitting them against one another. In addition, he has tried to refocus Sears onto the internet. This has involved the Shop Your Way strategy, in which Sears is to become an ""asset light"" company with ""members"" who can shop online and at more streamlined stores. Mr. Lampert has been pushing this idea for a while. In his annual letter last year, he wrote glowingly about Uber and its ability to have almost ""unlimited capital"" despite large losses. Sears and other older companies were held to a higher standard, he noted. ""Because of Sears and Kmart's longstanding history and cultural impact, we are targeted for criticism when our results are poor,"" he wrote. Mr. Lampert seemed to be saying that internet companies get a free pass, while Sears is subject to criticism. Despite the conventional wisdom, though, it is not Amazon that is primarily to blame for Sears's plight. Sears is being squeezed by changing economies and technology. Shoppers go to Walmart for discount items or to Target for discount items with a touch of style. The high end stays at stores like Nordstrom. The middle is smaller and increasingly shops online. (Sears, when asked to comment, referred to recent news releases.) People love to hate hedge fund guys, and perhaps the biggest criticism of Mr. Lampert is that he acts like a hedge fund manager, slicing and dicing Sears to meet its fire hose cash-flow needs. And so Sears has been split up into multiple companies to create more value, but also to raise cash for Sears itself, like Seritage (Sears real estate), Orchard Supply Hardware. In the most recent example, Sears sold  the Craftsman brand to Black & Decker. Lots of financing transactions have included a rights offering and letters of credit and loans from Mr. Lampert's own hedge fund. The financial engineering has been extreme, while the turnaround has been slow to realize. In all of this, Sears itself has declined in value while Mr. Lampert's net worth has fallen to $2 billion from about $3 billion. So why doesn't he just try to liquidate the company instead? After all, Sears has $5 billion in inventory alone, lots of real estate still to monetize and beloved brands like Kenmore and DieHard that it has yet to sell. This is a classic 1980s play; the breakup value is much more than that of the existing company. One explanation is that it would be expensive to liquidate Sears. Shutting down 1,600 stores would be chaotic, and selling $5 billion worth of inventory at liquidation value would yield much less. Seritage, which mostly holds Sears property, would be significantly affected. But another explanation is that whatever you think of the execution, Sears is onto something. Bricks-and-mortar retail is not going away— it still dominates online sales and most likely always will. But retail is fragmenting and shifting into branded stores. Sears was once the Amazon of its day through its catalogs, and it successfully migrated to stores. Companies like Allstate, Dean Witter and Discover were spun out of Sears. Back then the company was everything to all consumers. Now, at a time when Amazon is everything to all customers, $24 billion in sales is still nothing to sneeze at, and surely some Sears stores are still profitable. This is ultimately Mr. Lampert's strategy — leverage a huge ground footprint to extend into the internet. A ground footprint is valuable not just because people still mostly shop by ground but also as a delivery vehicle. Amazon itself is opening up some physical stores. Here, Mr. Lampert is betting that Sears can transform itself by leveraging its ground footprint and streamlining it. It has invested in a newer, more streamlined store format selling appliances. The first of these opened in Fort Collins, Colo. But that belies the question of whom Sears is marketing to: discount shoppers or a more upmarket crowd? In today's day and age it is impossible to be everything for everyone in a physical store when the internet is simply much better at it. All of this must be done when Amazon or Walmart could buy the retailer for pocket change at this point. If Sears intended to dominate the internet, it should have started 15 years ago when it had the brand recognition to do so. In the end, the problem with Sears may be that while Mr. Lampert may be sure of Sears's value, the public just isn't sure of where it stands in the hierarchy of retailers when a ground store selling everything just isn't what it used to be. No amount of Wall Street alchemy and deal-making can fix this problem."
0,2017-01-19," Binge TV is entering a new phase in which the makers of your shows, in particular at places like Netflix and Amazon, are betting that the satisfaction of gorging on eight to 10 episodes, batch-released, will be enough to glue you to your phone, laptop or, if you're feeling fancy, your actual television. The joy is in the completion. Neither attention to quality nor narrative structure matter, necessarily. They drop it. You stream it. ""The OA"" on Netflix and ""Search Party"" on TBS are that kind of show. ""The OA"" is about a young woman (Brit Marling) who was blind when she went missing seven years ago and returns a strange, sighted woman. ""Search Party"" is a half-hour comedy with Alia Shawkat as a young Brooklynite who goes looking for a disappeared classmate she only sort of knew. Both shows are thinking about what it means to be lost, found and understood. Both shows in different ways are about the so-called millennial generation. (""Search Party"" is a millennial satire — isn't it?) On this week's Still Processing, we're devoting a segment to unpacking both shows, connecting them, and finding out whether or not they work as television, binge or otherwise. ""Have you ever seen a show that treats millennialism with any degree of sincerity or honesty?"" Jenna asks on the show. ""Let me give you my first answer,"" Wesley responds. ""My first answer is no TV show treats anybody with any respect, at all. It doesn't matter what generation."" Also on this week's episode: Because it is Barack Obama's last week in the White House, we talk about this one thing he did that really sums up his unprecedented relationship to popular culture. (Wesley has a lot to say about Obama's relationship to the arts.) We also spend some time talking about tech etiquette with our pal Juliet Litman, managing editor of The Ringer.

0,2017-01-22," NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico — She spent weeks hiking through the Amazon, crossing a crocodile-filled river. She scaled border walls, escaped from immigration detention in Panama and slept in a church. Broke, hungry and exhausted, she found refuge with indigenous people in the jungle who took her in and fed her for a week. Finally, six months after fleeing Cuba on a tortuous journey to the United States, Marleni Barbier, a dental assistant from Havana, made it to the border with Texas — about 12 hours too late. More than 1,000 Cuban migrants who endured monthslong treks across as many as 10 countries to reach the United States are marooned in Mexico, halted by the Obama administration's decision this month to end special immigration privileges for Cubans who make it to the American border. The abrupt change is a profound one for Cubans, who fled their country by the tens of thousands in the last year to take advantage of a decades-old policy that permitted them to enter the United States. Now, the many Cubans stranded in Mexico — and potentially thousands more plodding up the migrant trail through the Americas — are hoping for a reprieve: that President Trump, who was elected on a promise to build a wall along the Mexican border, will let them through. ""I have faith that Trump will change it,"" said Ms. Barbier, 44, who arrived at the Texas border right after President Barack Obama announced the end of special rights for Cubans. ""To take away a law at the last minute like that, it's so unjust."" Some of the Cubans stuck in limbo here at the Texas border arrived on Jan. 12, the same day the Obama administration eliminated the so-called wet foot, dry foot rule. The rule, which dated to 1995, allowed Cubans who reached the United States to enter the country. About 150 Cubans are parked only 50 steps from the pedestrian bridge that connects Nuevo Laredo, in Mexico, to Laredo, Texas. Bewildered and deflated, they are being fed by Mexican strangers, and they pray. ""Everybody was racing to get here before the inauguration on the 20th,"" said Yamila González Cabeza, 44, a teacher from Cuba, saying many migrants thought the Trump administration would be the one to shut the border. ""The reverse was true. We did not expect this surprise on the 12th."" The Cuban government has long abhorred the special immigration privileges, saying the policy bleeds the island of its citizens and lures waves of migrants into dangerous journeys by land and sea. In striking down the rule, Mr. Obama said it was ""designed for a different era"" during a period of hostilities before the United States restored diplomatic relations with the Cuban government. By taking away their privilege to enter, Mr. Obama said, the United States would treat Cuban migrants ""the same way we treat migrants from other countries."" That decision could now put Mr. Trump in an awkward position: He campaigned on an anti-immigration platform, vowing not to let migrants slip through American borders. But he has also threatened to overturn Mr. Obama's executive orders and get tough on the Cuban government. Mr. Trump has in the past said the wet foot, dry foot policy, which sent back Cubans caught at sea but allowed those who reached land to enter, was unfair. Still, the Cubans here hope he will show humanitarian compassion for people who undertook arduous voyages to escape Communism and extreme poverty. Ms. Barbier said she had spent all of the $8,000 she made from the sale of her house in Cuba to make it this far. ""That money is gone, gone, gone,"" she said. About 41,000 Cubans made similar trips across the Americas last year. But because she got to the border a little too late, Ms. Barbier and other Cubans like her may be sent back unless they can prove they endured individual persecution, not just poverty or lack of opportunity, on the island. ""I certainly have sympathy for them, but the policy has been changed, and the moment they changed it, the policy was eliminated,"" said Representative Henry Cuellar, a Democrat who represents Laredo. ""They didn't say anyone in the pipeline can come in. By luck, some got in and some did not."" Eliannes Matos Salazar, 32, said she had been at the border station here all day on Jan. 12, and had already been photographed and fingerprinted, when she was forced to leave after the announcement. Yet her husband got through and is now in Las Vegas, she said. ""They can check their surveillance camera footage, because they will see me on it,"" said Ms. Matos, who came from Guantánamo, the Cuban city where the American naval base is. Alberto Ramírez Balmaseda said he had turned back because border agents told him that he would face long periods of incarceration for a chance at presenting proof of persecution to a judge. ""What evidence do we have? That there's been a Castro regime in power for about 60 years?"" Mr. Ramírez said. ""If you are a political prisoner in Cuba, they don't put 'political prisoner' on your criminal record. They say you stole a pig."" Several of the Cubans interviewed said that even if they had not had political problems before they left, they would if they were sent back. Yenier Echevarría González, 31, who worked as a baker in the tourism industry, said state security agents had seen a photo he posted from Brazil on Facebook, so they showed up at his house in Cuba and demanded that his wife sign his employment resignation papers. He had been gone just a week and had not officially emigrated. ""First of all, if I'm deported I will probably have to serve two months in jail,"" Mr. Echevarría said. ""And I will never again have a job, a car or a house — ever."" The Cuban government promised in the 1995 migration accords with Washington not to retaliate against Cubans who were turned back, said Holly Ackerman, a Duke University librarian who studies Cuban migration. To qualify for residency in the United States, Cubans will now have to show they would be personally persecuted back home. ""Being pinched and limited and controlled by the Cuban government isn't enough to satisfy the U.S. authorities any more,"" she said. ""Cubans who are thinking about exiting will undergo a profound reframing of their identity as a result of these changes."" Silvia Pedraza, a sociology professor at the University of Michigan, argued that while the prior policy had been flawed, it was naïve to treat Cubans as economic immigrants. ""One has to distinguish people who leave totalitarian countries,"" she said. ""For sure, the weight of the economic circumstances is very strong in their lives, because the daily stuff of life in Cuba is so difficult that when Cubans talk, that's what they begin talking about. But it does not seem right not to recognize the political nature of this."" José Martín Carmona Flores, who runs a state agency in Mexico that offers humanitarian assistance to migrants, said that about 200 Cubans were currently in Nuevo Laredo, and that an additional 1,100 were waiting in other cities until they decided what to do. According to the International Office of Migration, about 250 Cubans were being processed at the southern Mexico border when the announcement was made. Scores who arrived since then are being sent back to Cuba. More than 11,000 Cubans arrived in Mexico in just the last three months of 2016, meaning that thousands more along the migrant route across the Americas could still flood Mexico in the weeks to come. On Friday morning, the Mexican government deported 91 of them who had entered along the southern border. ""I am very worried for them,"" Mr. Carmona said. ""They have no plan. They have no backup plan if their original plan fails. They are truly vulnerable to illness, an epidemic, extortion. In many ways they are much more vulnerable than the Central American migrants we are accustomed to dealing with."" Mr. Carmona's agency was created after 78 migrants were massacred in his state by a drug cartel in 2010. Central Americans are regularly kidnapped and extorted, a fate Cubans have largely escaped in the past because they did not linger long. ""I think they are going to have to reach some kind of amnesty or truce and be returned to their country; Mexico will have to do it, because they are here,"" Mr. Carmona said. ""Who is going to be the executioner? Who is going to return these people to a place where they are likely to be 'sanctioned' — to put a friendly word to it?"""
0,2017-01-24," When ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" first aired in the 1980s, it envisioned a number of technological advances for humankind's future. Set in the 24th century, the show featured 3-D printers, visors that could provide artificial sight and a virtual reality simulator called the holodeck. But perhaps its most prescient creation was the supercomputer onboard the ship. The software — usually referred to only as ""Computer"" — could locate people, open doors and retrieve answers to complicated questions. Crew members spoke their requests, and an always-present helper responded within seconds. Amazon brought a version of that computer to life recently — albeit a few centuries earlier than ""Star Trek"" predicted. Last July, David Limp, a company executive who works on the product, said in an interview with Fortune that the idea of an all-knowing machine, with access to all the world's information, had captured his imagination since the first time he saw it on television. It took, he said, a team of 1,000 engineers to write its code, and when the device was finished, Amazon decided to call it Alexa, shorthand for Alexandria, as in the ancient Library of Alexandria in Egypt. It is designed to work primarily with a suite of wireless speakers, also made by Amazon, called Echo, Echo Dot and Tap. The company bills Alexa as a smart personal assistant, one that can play your favorite song or read you a book or recite a recipe as you cook. You can also make purchases through Amazon simply by asking. The possibilities are seemingly endless, because Alexa can learn new ""skills"" (as Amazon likes to call them) from third-party developers who integrate Alexa into their own products. And developers have leapt at the opportunity to do so: At the beginning of 2016, there were 135 skills designed to work with Alexa, but this year that number increased to more than 7,000. Alexa can now order you an Uber or a pizza, check your bank balance, control your TV, turn your lights on and off and even measure your car's carbon-dioxide emissions. "" 'Alexa, buy me coffee' is just a fraction of what it's going to be over time,"" said Ben Schachter, an internet analyst who covers Amazon for the equities firm Macquarie Securities. ""What can they improve with the voice activation? Some of that has yet to be seen."" Alexa has already evolved from an experimental device to an irresistible household fixture — perhaps surprisingly, given Amazon's spotty track record with hardware. Kindle e-readers are popular, but the company's attempt at a smartphone flopped hard. Schachter told me that part of Alexa's success was luck, in that there were few other shiny consumer offerings on the market this holiday season and the price point was affordable. But something about the future-feel of this device, its ease and convenience, has captivated a mass audience, even the most privacy-conscious among us. Alexa is always listening, ready to be of service. (This has already backfired: When a newscaster relayed a story about a little girl using her Alexa to order a dollhouse, it triggered dozens of Alexas in the homes of people watching the broadcast to also try to order one.) Five years ago, few would have guessed that Amazon would already be ahead of the top tech companies vying to be leaders in home automation. But Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of the company, has been shaping this vision since the earliest days of Amazon. I recently revisited ""The Everything Store,"" a 2013 book by Brad Stone about how Bezos transformed the start-up from an online bookstore into the e-commerce behemoth it is today. ""Bezos' long-term goal is to sell everything, everywhere,"" Stone writes. ""He will attempt to move faster, work his employees harder, make bolder bets and pursue both big inventions and small ones, all to achieve his grand vision for Amazon — that it be not just an everything store, but ultimately an everything company."" The fact that I live in New York, a city that thrives on accessibility, might explain why I was slow to grasp the appeal of Alexa. Here we have bodegas on every corner, most open 24 hours, in case you need to pick up a roll of toilet paper or a bottle of hot sauce in the middle of the night. But most Americans don't live with the luxury of that immediacy. I didn't really understand this until the holidays, when I went home to visit my mom in Virginia and we ran out of seltzer. Carbonated water is not an essential item. But in that moment, it would have been easier to quickly tell Alexa to place an order for us and forget about it until it arrived two or three days later, rather than try to remember to pick up a case of Poland Spring the next time someone made the 20-minute drive to the store. That's the entire enticing promise of Amazon and Alexa: a much more efficient and manageable life, one in which you can outsource mundane tasks while you do something more important, like spend time with your family. It's not hard to imagine that Alexa might be displaced as rivals introduce their own efforts. Facebook is working on an intelligent assistant, called Jarvis (named for the smart computer that helps Tony Stark, or Iron Man, navigate his surroundings), as is Microsoft. There are rumors that Apple is working on a major update for Siri. Google is currently Amazon's closest competitor. The company has spent decades organizing the world's information and learning about our habits and preferences in the process, so that it will one day know what we want even before we do. Search, then, will evolve away from the actual act of searching to the act of surfacing. The company is working on a version of artificial intelligence called Google Assistant to perfect that very ability. But while Google is working to anticipate your needs, Amazon is readying itself to be the only place you need to go to fulfill them. Thinking about Amazon's restraints — the company has never tried to introduce a social network or an email service, for example — you can understand something about the future Amazon seems to envision: A time when no screen is needed at all, just your voice. Anand Sanwal, the chief executive of CB Insights, a trend-forecasting start-up in New York, told me that Amazon has something that its competitors only dream of — consumer attention and trust. ""In the last few years, Amazon has become the search engine for consumer products, instead of Google,"" he said. ""If you're going to buy something, and you already have an Amazon account, you're probably going to just buy it there. With Google, you still have to go to Amazon or Walmart."" Amazon is investing in supply trailers, drones and fulfillment centers to develop its own postal service and delivery system. And it's still pushing its Dash buttons, those small pieces of hardware with one purpose: to order a single item from Amazon, like laundry detergent or dish soap. They seem unnecessary, until you consider them with all of Amazon's other efforts: It's not just an everything store, or even an everything company, but an everywhere (and anytime!) store. The various products that Amazon is planning to roll out — including Pantry and Fresh, its grocery service — can be easily baked into default Alexa services. Restaurants, the company's version of Seamless, already is. All this in turn brings in more money for Amazon. As Limp put it back in July: ""The nice thing about the Amazon device business is that when we sell a device, generally people buy more bluejeans. And little black dresses. And shoes."" There's a theory that behavioral economists use to explain our consumption habits called ""hyperbolic discounting,"" which is the tendency to choose short-term rewards over long-term gains. The ""marshmallow test"" of the 1960s tested the ability of preschoolers to resist temptation — the titular marshmallow, within reach — with the promise that they would be rewarded with two if they waited. In the experiment's most popular interpretation, those who had self-control grew up to be much more successful than those who did not. It is one of the most formative studies in self-control and how people make decisions. Alexa is the ultimate marshmallow test, and most of us are failing. We are being conditioned, as a population, to never wait, to never delay our gratification, to accept thoughtless, constant consumption as the new norm. But how we think about consumption and willpower carry enormous implications for the environment and the culture of society as a whole. Think about that the next time you ask Alexa to order you another roll of toilet paper."
0,2017-01-25," George Orwell's classic book ""1984,"" about a dystopian future where critical thought is suppressed under a totalitarian regime, has seen a surge in sales this month, rising to the top of the Amazon best-seller list in the United States and leading its publisher to have tens of thousands of new copies printed. Craig Burke, the publicity director at Penguin USA, said that the publisher had ordered 75,000 new copies of the book this week and that it was considering another reprint. ""We've seen a big bump in sales,"" Mr. Burke said. He added that the rise ""started over the weekend and hit hyperactive"" on Tuesday and Wednesday morning. Since Friday, the book has reached a 9,500 percent increase in sales, he said. He said demand began to lift on Sunday, shortly after the interview Kellyanne Conway, an adviser to Donald J. Trump, gave on ""Meet the Press."" In defending a false claim by the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, that Mr. Trump had attracted the ""largest audience ever to witness an inauguration,"" Ms. Conway used a turn of phrase that struck some observers as similar to the dystopian world of ""1984."" When asked on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" why Mr. Spicer had said something that was provably false, Ms. Conway replied airily, ""Don't be so dramatic."" Mr. Spicer, she said, ""gave alternative facts."" In the novel, the term ""newspeak"" refers to language in which independent thought, or ""unorthodox"" political ideas, have been eliminated. ""Doublethink"" is defined as ""reality control."" On social media and elsewhere on Sunday, the book's readers made a connection between Ms. Conway's comments and Orwell's language, and the attention on the book ""kind of took a life of its own,"" Mr. Burke said. The dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster described the interview as ""fraught with epistemological tension."" The dictionary also reported that searches for the word ""fact"" spiked after Ms. Conway's comments, and then, as an apparent reminder, tweeted the dictionary's definition. Even outside the United States, interest in ""1984"" has grown. So far this year, sales have risen by 20 percent in Britain and Australia compared to the same period a year ago, according to Jess Harrison, a London-based editor at Penguin Books. The novel is usually a best-seller, she said, and it sold 100,000 copies last year in English-speaking countries outside the United States and Canada. ""But we've definitely seen an uplift"" in sales, she added. Dystopian novels are ""chiming with people,"" Ms. Harrison said, adding that ""The Man in the High Castle"" by Philip K. Dick, an alternative history in which the Nazis defeated America to win World War II, is also selling well. A television series based on Mr. Dick's novel is now in its second season at Amazon. Penguin also published Sinclair Lewis's ""It Can't Happen Here,"" about the rise of a demagogue, last Friday in Britain for the first time since 1935, ""and we're already on to our third printing,"" Mr. Burke said. On Wednesday, that book was also ranking among Amazon's best sellers, as was Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World,"" another dystopian classic. Prof. Stefan Collini, a professor of intellectual history and an expert on Orwell at the University of Cambridge, said that readers see a natural parallel between the book and the way Mr. Trump and his staff have distorted facts. ""Everyone remembers '1984' as containing various parodies of official distortions,"" he said. ""That kind of unreality that is propagated as reality is what people feel reminded of, and that's why they keep coming back."""
0,2017-01-26," Perhaps the kindest way to look at the Amazon series ""Z: The Beginning of Everything"" is as a brave example of revisionist history. Any college English major knows that Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald were one of the liveliest literary couples ever, right? And the flapper era was a blizzard of energy and saucy fun, wasn't it? Well, this series, which arrives Friday on Amazon, makes both the Fitzgeralds and the 1920s seem drab as dishwater. Christina Ricci plays the title letter, who when we first meet her is Zelda Sayre, living a privileged life in Montgomery, Ala., during World War I. She meets Scott (David Hoflin), an aspiring writer who barely avoids being shipped off to fight thanks to the armistice. He soon whisks her out of there, which is fortunate since it means we no longer have to listen to David Strathairn, who plays her strict and humorless father, mouth lines like: ""Zelda Sayre, you come back here. You do not walk away from your father when he is addressing you."" Not so fortunately, what follows is no more interesting than the Southern-belle banalities of the show's early moments. As the newly married Fitzgeralds ride the success of ""This Side of Paradise,"" published in 1920, there are endless shots of one or both drinking from a bottle, imbibing in bathtubs and so on, navigating the party circuit in New York and elsewhere. Watching the spectacle is like being stuck in a hipster party that never ends or stops wallowing in its self-indulgence and self-importance. The series is based on Therese Anne Fowler's book ""Z: A Novel of Zelda Fitzgerald"" and is a fictionalized version of the Fitzgeralds' lives with a reasonable underpinning of fact and real-life figures. The series, though, is mostly content to name-check these people — Heywood Broun (Tony Manna); H. L. Mencken (Bill Phillips); Edna St. Vincent Millay (Lucy Walters); the Bankhead sisters, Tallulah (Christina Bennett Lind) and Eugenia (Natalie Knepp). None are given enough screen time over the 10 episodes to emerge as full characters; it's as if they're thrown in for the benefit of the academic crowd who will recognize the references. That's too bad, because some of them probably could have been more interesting than the central couple, who, as played by Ms. Ricci and Mr. Hoflin, are entirely devoid of the thing that the real Fitzgeralds apparently had in abundance: chemistry. Without any sign of a romantic spark, it is not clear why they would endure one another and stay together. There is exactly one sizzling moment in the 10 installments, and it has nothing to do with the couple's supposedly fiery romance. It occurs in Episode 7, when Scott, returning to Princeton to talk about his novel, lashes out at the stuffy professors he studied under there. ""It's not a book that any of you will ever assign, or value, or even understand,"" he says. ""No book of mine will ever be. And all the writing I've done and will do is in spite of you. You teach with two goals: to prop up literature that is long dead and to curry favor with the wealthiest students just so you can indulge in the fantasy that you belong to their world."" Too bad the moment passes so quickly. The 10 episodes don't get very far into the couple's history — by the end, Scott is still struggling to produce another successful book, his problems with alcohol are only beginning to emerge, and Zelda's mental instability has yet to make its presence felt. Clearly, Amazon intends to milk this premise a bit longer, but the first round is so dreary that it's hard to imagine anyone clamoring for more."

0,2017-01-31," SEATTLE — Technology executives have for days assailed President Trump's executive order suspending immigration from seven mostly Muslim countries, framing their arguments largely in moral terms. On Monday, two tech companies — Amazon and Expedia — stepped up their opposition to the order with filings that were part of a lawsuit in federal court against the Trump administration, arguing that the order will hurt their businesses. The filings represent an escalation of the technology industry's efforts to push back on the order signed by Mr. Trump on Friday night. There was little sign of the outcry over the order diminishing throughout the industry, as employees at Google staged demonstrations in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond. Amazon and Expedia made declarations supporting a lawsuit filed against the Trump administration in federal court Monday night in Seattle by Washington State's attorney general. The lawsuit, part of a growing wave of legal challenges to the immigration ban across the country, asked the court to declare key parts of the executive order unconstitutional. Expedia argued that the executive order hurt its ability to recruit employees from overseas, and it also could undermine the core of the company's business as an internet travel company. ""Expedia believes that the executive order jeopardizes its corporate mission and could have a detrimental impact on its business and employees, as well as the broader U.S. and global travel and tourism industry,"" Robert Dzielak, the company's general counsel, wrote in the filing. As of Sunday, at least a thousand Expedia customers with passports from one of the seven countries, which includes Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, have made travel plans that involve flights to, from or through the United States. Dara Khosrowshahi, Expedia's chief executive, was born in Iran and fled the country with his parents in 1978 shortly before Iran became an Islamic republic during the revolution. ""The president's order represents the worst of his proclivity toward rash action versus thoughtfulness,"" Mr. Khosrowshahi said in a statement. ""Ours is a nation of immigrants. These are our roots, this is our soul. All erased with the stroke of a pen."" Amazon said it was aware of 49 employees out of its United States work force of 180,000 who are from one of the countries identified in the executive order, nearly all of whom hold citizenship in another country. Seven job candidates, all of them originally from Iran but citizens of other countries, have received employment offers from Amazon. The company is considering jobs for the candidates in other countries. In an email to Amazon employees, the chief executive, Jeff Bezos, said the company had expressed its opposition to the order to senior administration officials and congressional leaders. He said the company was exploring ""other legal options as well."" ""For tech leaders, it's a work force issue,"" said Michael Schutzler, the chief executive of the Washington Technology Industry Association, a trade group representing the state's technology companies. ""We have a huge shortage of talent. We create jobs 10 times faster than the state can produce talent. Reducing our ability to recruit talent to the state essentially concedes the field to our international competitors."" Technology companies are bracing for another executive order, expected to be signed by Mr. Trump soon, that could affect them further with changes to the system for issuing visas to foreign workers. Technology companies are big users of H-1Bs and other forms of visas for hiring engineers from overseas. At Google's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., hundreds of employees crowded into a quad near the main cafeteria to protest the order. Employees carried signs like ""Trump, Don't Be Evil"" and ""Silicon Valley: Built by Immigrants,"" while others chanted ""No Ban, No Wall"" into a megaphone. It was a scene more fitting for a college campus than a gathering of employees at one of America's most valuable companies. Google offices in other cities like Seattle, San Francisco and New York held similar rallies. Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, told employees at the rally that immigration was ""core to the founding of this company."" When the Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who attended the protests at the San Francisco airport on Saturday, was introduced, the crowd broke into chants of ""Sergey, Sergey, Sergey."" Mr. Brin noted that he came to the United States as a 6-year-old refugee from the Soviet Union when nuclear tensions between the two countries were at their peak. ""Even then, the U.S. had the courage to take me and my family in as refugees,"" he said. ""I wouldn't be where I am today or have any kind of life I have today if this wasn't a great country that stood up and spoke for liberty,"" Mr. Brin added. Soufi Esmaeilzadeh, a Google product manager who is an Iranian national with Canadian citizenship who resides in the United States with a green card, said that Google's immigration team initially recommended that she not return home from a business trip in Switzerland after the order was signed on Friday. ""My life is in the U.S. I felt angry, scared, and honestly rejected,"" she said. ""I don't feel free or at peace."" But after the stay won by the American Civil Liberties Union, Google told her that she might have a small window to return but needed to leave immediately. Flying through Dublin, she said four immigration officers pored over her paperwork. She eventually arrived in San Francisco on Sunday."

0,2017-02-07," He is the most successful and influential investor you have probably never heard of. His writings are so coveted and followed by Wall Street that a used copy of a book he wrote several decades ago about investing starts at $795 on Amazon, and a new copy sells for as much as $3,500. Perhaps that's why a private letter he wrote to his investors a little over two weeks ago about investing during the age of President Trump — and offering his thoughts on the current state of the hedge fund industry — has quietly become the most sought-after reading material on Wall Street. He is Seth A. Klarman, the 59-year-old value investor who runs Baupost Group, which manages some $30 billion. While Mr. Klarman has long kept a low public profile, he is considered a giant within investment circles. He is often compared to Warren Buffett, and The Economist magazine once described him as ""The Oracle of Boston,"" where Baupost is based. For good measure, he is one of the very few hedge managers Mr. Buffett has publicly praised. In his letter, Mr. Klarman sets forth a countervailing view to the euphoria that has buoyed the stock market since Mr. Trump took office, describing ""perilously high valuations."" ""Exuberant investors have focused on the potential benefits of stimulative tax cuts, while mostly ignoring the risks from America-first protectionism and the erection of new trade barriers,"" he wrote. ""President Trump may be able to temporarily hold off the sweep of automation and globalization by cajoling companies to keep jobs at home, but bolstering inefficient and uncompetitive enterprises is likely to only temporarily stave off market forces,"" he continued. ""While they might be popular, the reason the U.S. long ago abandoned protectionist trade policies is because they not only don't work, they actually leave society worse off."" In particular, Mr. Klarman appears to believe that investors have become hypnotized by all the talk of pro-growth policies, without considering the full ramifications. He worries, for example, that Mr. Trump's stimulus efforts ""could prove quite inflationary, which would likely shock investors."" And he appears deeply concerned about a swelling national debt that he suggests could undermine the economy's growth over the long term. ""The Trump tax cuts could drive government deficits considerably higher,"" Mr. Klarman wrote. ""The large 2001 Bush tax cuts, for example, fueled income inequality while triggering huge federal budget deficits. Rising interest rates alone would balloon the federal deficit, because interest payments on the massive outstanding government debt would skyrocket from today's artificially low levels."" Much of Mr. Klarman's anxiety seems to emanate from Mr. Trump's leadership style. He described it this way: ""The erratic tendencies and overconfidence in his own wisdom and judgment that Donald Trump has demonstrated to date are inconsistent with strong leadership and sound decision-making."" He also linked this point — which is a fair one — to what ""Trump style"" means for Mr. Klarman's constituency and others. ""The big picture for investors is this: Trump is high volatility, and investors generally abhor volatility and shun uncertainty,"" he wrote. ""Not only is Trump shockingly unpredictable, he's apparently deliberately so; he says it's part of his plan."" While Mr. Klarman clearly is hoping for the best, he warned, ""If things go wrong, we could find ourselves at the beginning of a lengthy decline in dollar hegemony, a rapid rise in interest rates and inflation, and global angst."" Mr. Klarman is a registered independent and has given money to politicians from both parties. He has donated to Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, John McCain and Rudolph W. Giuliani as well as Hillary Clinton, Cory Booker and Mark Warner. While he has remained largely outside the public eye, Mr. Klarman surprised some of his friends and peers over the summer when he issued a statement after Mr. Trump criticized a judge over his Mexican heritage, saying he planned to support Mrs. Clinton: ""His words and actions over the last several days are so shockingly unacceptable in our diverse and democratic society that it is simply unthinkable that Donald Trump could become our president."" In his recent letter, he explained for the first time his decision to say something publicly. ""Despite my preference to stay out of the media,"" he wrote, ""I've taken the view that each of us can be bystanders, or we can be upstanders. I choose upstander."" From the letter, it is hard to divine exactly how Mr. Klarman is investing his fund's money. His office declined to comment on the letter, which I obtained from a source. His fund currently has more than 30 percent of its funds in cash. He has lost money in only three of the past 34 years. What investors say publicly and what they do in the markets can be different things. Mr. Buffett campaigned publicly against Mr. Trump, but he has nevertheless invested in the market since his election — about $12 billion, according to a recent disclosure. George Soros, who also actively campaigned against Mr. Trump, bet — wrongly so far — that the stock market would fall; he lost about $1 billion. Most hedge funds have found themselves on the losing side of trades over the past several years, a point Mr. Klarman addressed in his letter. Noting that hedge fund returns have underperformed the indexes — he mentioned that hedge funds had returned only 23 percent from 2010 to 2015, compared with 108 percent for the Standard & Poor's index — he blamed the influx of money into the industry. ""With any asset class, when substantial new money flows in, the returns go down,"" Mr. Klarman wrote. ""No surprise, then, that as money poured into hedge funds, overall returns have soured."" He continued, ""To many, hedge funds have come to seem like a failed product."" The lousy performance among hedge funds and the potential for them to go out of business or consolidate, he suggests, may become an opportunity. Perhaps the most distinctive point he makes — at least that finance geeks will appreciate — is what he says is the irony that investors now ""have gotten excited about market-hugging index funds and exchange traded funds (E.T.F.s) that mimic various market or sector indices."" He says he sees big trouble ahead in this area — or at least the potential for investors in individual stocks to profit. ""One of the perverse effects of increased indexing and E.T.F. activity is that it will tend to 'lock in' today's relative valuations between securities,"" Mr. Klarman wrote. ""When money flows into an index fund or index-related E.T.F., the manager generally buys into the securities in an index in proportion to their current market capitalization (often to the capitalization of only their public float, which interestingly adds a layer of distortion, disfavoring companies with large insider, strategic, or state ownership),"" he wrote. ""Thus today's high-multiple companies are likely to also be tomorrow's, regardless of merit, with less capital in the hands of active managers to potentially correct any mispricings."" To Mr. Klarman, ""stocks outside the indices may be cast adrift, no longer attached to the valuation grid but increasingly off of it."" ""This should give long-term value investors a distinct advantage,"" he wrote. ""The inherent irony of the efficient market theory is that the more people believe in it and correspondingly shun active management, the more inefficient the market is likely to become."" How Mr. Klarman wants investors to behave in the age of Trump remains an open question. But here's a hint: At the top of his letter, he included three quotations. One was attributed to Thomas Jefferson: ""In matters of style, swim with the current; in matters of principle, stand like a rock."""
0,2017-02-10," Deep in the Amazon, the rain forest once covered ancient secrets. Spread across hundreds of thousands of acres are massive, geometric earthworks. The carvings stretch out in circles and squares that can be as big as a city block, with trenches up to 12 yards wide and 13 feet deep. They appear to have been built up to 2,000 years ago. Were the broken ceramics found near the entrances used for ritual sacrifices? Why were they here? The answer remains a mystery. For centuries, the enigmatic structures remained hidden to all but a few archaeologists. Then in the 1980s, ranchers cleared land to raise cattle, uncovering the true extent of the earthworks in the process. More than 450 of these geoglyphs are concentrated within Acre State in Brazil. Since the discovery, archaeological study of the earthworks and other evidence has challenged the notion that the rain forests of the Amazon were untouched by human hands before the arrival of European explorers in the 15th century. And while the true purpose of the geoglyphs remains unknown, a study published on Monday in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences offers new insight into the lives of the ancient people who lived in the Amazon. Thousands of years before the earthworks were built, humans were managing the forests, using what appear to be sustainable agricultural practices. ""Our study was looking at the environmental impact that the geoglyph builders had on the landscape,"" said Jennifer Watling, an archaeologist at the University of São Paulo, Brazil, who conducted the research while a student at the University of Exeter in Britain. ""A lot of people have the idea that the Amazon forests are pristine forests, never touched by humans, and that's obviously not the case."" Dr. Watling and her team reconstructed a 6,000-year-old environmental history of two geoglyph sites in the Amazon rain forest. To do this, they searched for clues in soil samples in and around the sites. Microscopic plant fossils called phytoliths told them about ancient vegetation. Bits of charcoal revealed evidence of burnings. And a kind of carbon dating gave them a sense of how open the vegetation had been in the past. About 4,000 years ago, people started burning the forest, which was mostly bamboo, just enough to make small openings. They may have planted maize or squash, weeded out some underbrush, and transported seeds or saplings to create a partly curated forest of useful tree products that Dr. Watling calls a ""prehistoric supermarket."" After that, they started building the geoglyphs. The presence of just a few artifacts, and the layout of the earthworks, suggest they weren't used as ancient villages or for military defenses. They were likely built for rituals, some archaeologists suspect. Dr. Watling and her colleagues found that in contrast with the large-scale deforestation we see today — which threatens about 20 percent of the largest rain forest in the world — ancient indigenous people of the Amazon practiced something more akin to what we now call agroforestry. They restricted burns to site locations and maintained the surrounding landscape, creating small, temporary clearings in the bamboo and promoting the growth of plants like palm, cedar and Brazil nut that were, and still are, useful commodities. Today, indigenous groups around the world continue these sustainable practices in forests. ""Indigenous communities have actually transformed the ecosystem over a very long time,"" said Dr. Watling. ""The modern forest owes its biodiversity to the agroforestry practices that were happening during the time of the geoglyph builders."""
0,2017-02-13," How do behemoth technology companies test out new concepts? If you are Amazon, you use your hometown as a living lab. That's what Nick Wingfield, a tech reporter for The New York Times, found in Seattle, where Amazon was started and has its headquarters. In the past few years, the giant e-commerce company has tried out numerous retail experiments in Seattle, including a drive-up grocery store, a physical bookstore and a roaming delivery truck called the Treasure Truck. Amazon's tests have cemented Seattle's reputation as a hub for retail innovation, which in turn has spurred the creation of jobs and demand for office space in the city. In past years, REI, Costco and Nordstrom all got their start in Seattle. And Starbucks, which is also based in Seattle, has tried its own retail pilots in town, including opening its first high-end coffee bar, Roastery, there. If Amazon's retail pilots in Seattle are successful, the company sometimes rolls out the concepts across other places in the United States. So if you want a peek into your retail future, Seattle is a great place to see what may unfold."
1,2017-02-13," SEATTLE — On a busy stretch of road in this city's Ballard neighborhood, a curious new grocery store is taking shape — and so begins another effort by Amazon to use the residents of its hometown as guinea pigs. Workers are finishing up a driveway with a series of parking stalls, protected from the rain by a soaring steel canopy. When the store opens, customers will buy their items online, schedule a time slot to pick them up and pull into the stalls, where employees will whisk orders to their cars, according to documents filed with the city's planning department. Across town in the SoDo neighborhood, another Amazon drive-up grocery store is under construction. Late last year, Amazon began testing a new convenience-store concept in Seattle, Amazon Go, that uses sensors and other technology so shoppers can check out without having to visit a cashier. And in late 2015, it opened its first physical bookstore in a shopping mall in north Seattle, before expanding to more than a half-dozen other locations around the country. Amazon's success in online commerce has transformed Seattle by bringing jobs, wealth and an almost insatiable appetite for office space — along with grumbling about how expensive the city is getting. At the same time, the company is putting its stamp on the city by using it as a lab for its expanding array of unconventional experiments in bricks-and-mortar retailing. While Amazon has never articulated the grand strategy behind its expansion into physical stores, analysts and tech executives believe its goal is to capture a bigger share of some forms of shopping — food being the biggest — that may never move entirely online. Amazon isn't alone in using Seattle, home to Starbucks and other major retail brands, as a proving ground for new ideas in stores. But it is the main attraction among people focused on innovation in the category. ""I look at Seattle as the center of the retail universe,"" said Herb Sorensen, a researcher and consultant to brands on shopping behavior, referring to Amazon's activities in the city. Amazon declines to talk about the drive-up grocery stores it is building here. The most obvious reason the company tries out new ideas in its own backyard is that it makes life easier for corporate leadership to see them in action without having to get on planes. Executives closely scrutinize how customers use new stores and tweak them as they gather data. ""Amazon is a frugal company,"" said John Rossman, a former executive with the company who is a managing director with Alvarez & Marsal, a business consulting firm. ""They don't want to be flying teams around a lot to have them be hands-on with their beta operations and experiences."" Amazon's own technologically demanding employees are an important part of the feedback process. More than 25,000 of them work for the company in Seattle, and many serve as the first test cases for new concepts. The company opened its first Amazon Go store on the ground floor of one of its office buildings, where employees can buy prepared meals, drinks and snacks. Customers enter the store through a gate with a smartphone app and simply walk out with their goods when they're done. ""Seattle is Amazon's hometown, and experimenting close to our customers helps us innovate and learn faster in the early stages,"" said Sarah Gelman, an Amazon spokeswoman. Almost a decade ago, the company conducted one of its biggest local experiments when it started a grocery home delivery service, tinkering for almost five years before expanding the concept to a new city. Early on, Amazon allowed employees and their friends to use the service, which helped provide unvarnished feedback, said Ian Clarkson, then the general manager of the service, AmazonFresh. Mr. Clarkson recalls a friend telling him that AmazonFresh didn't stock a brand of orange juice her daughter liked. As a result, she said, she wouldn't shop through AmazonFresh since she would still need to go to a supermarket for the juice. Mr. Clarkson, now the chief operating officer at Varsity Tutors, an online tutoring service, said the comment was an eye-opener. ""We've got to be a lot better at that,"" he thought at the time. ""You're losing a basket as opposed to a unit."" Seattle has long been receptive to new ideas in retail. REI, Costco Wholesale and Nordstrom are among the store chains that got their start here. Starbucks opened its first coffee house in the Pike Place Market in 1971. Like Amazon, Starbucks tests projects locally before exporting them elsewhere. It opened its first Roastery, a high-end coffee bar, in an old Packard car dealership in the city, and plans to open up to 30 more in places as far-flung as Shanghai, New York and Tokyo. Several years ago, it came up with a new idea for building drive-through Starbucks stores out of recycled shipping containers to promote sustainability, trying out the design just south of Seattle before opening others across the country. ""It's very much a community of early adopters,"" said Leonard Garfield, executive director of the Museum of History and Industry in Seattle. One of Amazon's more puzzling retail experiments in Seattle is the Treasure Truck, a roaming delivery truck retrofitted with carnival-style lights and signs, from which customers can pick up items offered during flash sales through the Amazon mobile app. The truck, which seems like the offspring of a billboard and an ice cream truck, has sold wild mahi-mahi steaks, paddle boards and Nintendo game consoles. Adam Croft, an audio producer for Microsoft, described the Treasure Truck as a ""party bus"" and said he had bought a drone and a ""Star Wars"" BB-8 droid toy from it. He has also patronized Amazon's bookstore in Seattle and thought it was clever of the company to require customers to scan bar codes on books with their phones to get prices, which can fluctuate. ""Seattleites will say they hate Amazon taking over downtown, but at the same time when Amazon rolls out something special, after everyone complains about it, the first thing people want to do is go check it out,"" said Mr. Croft, who says his employment with another technology company doesn't color his views of Amazon. Not everyone agrees. ""I don't use any Amazon services,"" Sherman Alexie, the novelist and poet, who lives in Seattle, wrote in an email. Mr. Alexie, who has an office in the South Lake Union neighborhood, where many of Amazon's office buildings are found, believes the company's goal is to replace human workers with as much automation as possible. Amazon has created hundreds of thousands of jobs, but by some estimates has not made up for the positions eliminated by the crumbling of bricks-and-mortar retailers. The company's growth has contributed to a booming economy in its hometown, where the median single-family home price jumped to $548,000 last year from $340,000 five years ago, according to the Northwest Multiple Listing Service. As much as Seattle residents like technology, some say the population is more representative of the rest of the country than shoppers in other cities. ""San Francisco is ludicrously tech-forward,"" said Dan Shapiro, the chief executive of a start-up, called Glowforge, that makes a laser cutting device. ""What's interesting to me about Seattle is it's about as tech-friendly and prosperous as you can go without being completely off the rails."" James Adams, a principal at 5ive Creative, a design firm in Seattle, put it differently: ""We're the most Midwest West Coast city there is. I don't mean that negatively. We're not so coastal. We're not L.A."" Some Seattle retailers are looking at Amazon's local experiments with more bafflement than fear. As owner of one of Seattle's most prominent bookstores, the Elliott Bay Book Company, Peter Aaron should, by all accounts, be terrified of Amazon's bookstore. But Elliott Bay had record sales last year, and he can't figure out why Amazon, with its size, would bother with the relatively low sales volumes of physical bookstores. Amazon's global book sales are estimated to be in the billions of dollars, which would dwarf the proceeds from an independent shop. ""I know these are very smart people,"" Mr. Aaron said. ""I assume there's some kind of design or plan that makes sense. I can't figure out why they're doing it."""
0,2017-02-17," There's a reason people say — jokingly or not — ""Netflix and chill"" and not ""Amazon Video and chill"" or ""Hulu and chill"" or ""Vudu and chill."" Netflix has become the default home entertainment/social option not because it's a movie lover's oasis but because it serves a fluid audience that toggles between movies and original series without much care. For all it doesn't have in terms of classic films, it does have the likes of ""Captain America: Civil War"" and, soon with a pending licensing deal with Disney, the likes of ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story."" Amazon Video is immense and genuinely eclectic, offering a more labyrinthine experience than anyone whose ultimate goal contains ""and chill"" might want to wade through. As for Hulu and Vudu, well, ""Netflix and chill"" scans better as a catchphrase than those options do, but there are more immediately practical reasons. One is that Netflix's identity has remained pretty static as it has captured the yens of the mainstream. Hulu is still evolving. One may remember the brash ad campaign in which the spokesman Alec Baldwin touted Hulu as ""an evil plot to destroy the world"" by providing sufficiently entrancing television content to turn a viewer's brain into mush. In my household, the main use of Hulu, before it went to a subscription model, was as a place to find ""Saturday Night Live"" sketches, which at the time weren't almost immediately available on YouTube after they aired. For some time, cinephiles found Hulu attractive because it was the service where the Criterion Collection roosted some of its titles. But then Criterion migrated to FilmStruck, a more cohesive service in that it's pitched exclusively to fans of classic cinema. The next iteration of the service was aimed at cord-cutters — consumers who want to get rid of cable television but still have access to shows from its popular channels. Right now, as far as films go, Hulu is for the most part a repository of blandness. Once you sign up, the service, like Netflix, helps you create a profile, based on its own interpretations of genre; do you like ""Edgy Animation,"" ""Imaginative Cartoons"" or both? Once profiling is done, the site is pretty easy to navigate, albeit kind of blocky in its page design. One of Hulu's ""exclusive"" movies is ""The Beatles: Eight Days a Week,"" a pleasant documentary directed by Ron Howard about the Fab Four's years as a touring unit. It's pitched so squarely into the lane of the American baby boomer that everything else about the service makes complete sense with that in mind. But it's also true that, in keeping with its initial TV-centric emphasis, the site doesn't offer a particularly distinguished movie-watching experience. The most outré offering I found over a long stretch of browsing was ""Amélie."" Which, aside from being in French with English subtitles, is hardly outré at all. After a bit, I decided to relive one of the more uneventful experiences of my early career as a film critic, Garry Marshall's ""Runaway Bride"" (1999), which reunited Richard Gere and Julia Roberts almost 10 years after Marshall made some kind of movie history with them in ""Pretty Woman."" The experience remained uneventful, and the presentation didn't even have Surround Sound. (On the other hand, the site did lead me down the rabbit hole of last year's first-rate, eight-hour documentary ""O.J.: Made In America,"" which I had needed to catch up with.) The mission of Vudu, on the other hand, seems very movie-oriented, with a special emphasis on delivering snazzy presentations of its titles. The company, which began its consumer life in 2008, was bought in 2010 by Walmart. One of Walmart's most prominent characteristics is that it sells high-definition flat TV displays by the aircraft carrier, so to speak. As do, of course, Costco, Target, Best Buy and the like. But I give Walmart props for attaching to its display-retail business a service with nearly 20,000 movies in high-definition. It's as if you brought a puppy or kitten home from the animal shelter and the shelter also gave you vouchers for pet food. When you first sign on to Vudu, the site goes through whatever box you're getting it through (in my case, a PlayStation 4) and tests your internet speed, to see if you can handle Vudu's truth. Then you set parental controls. You can rent or buy movies in either the standard definition format or, in many cases, in the proprietary HDX format, which delivers movies at close to Blu-ray disc quality. I'm not yet equipped for 4K, or Ultra-High Definition, display, but Vudu's got that, too. Searching for a high-def experience by which I could gauge HDX, I settled on a big studio movie I hadn't yet seen, ""Fifty Shades of Grey."" I know the generations that missed out on what was called the sexual revolution need something to make them feel not left out, but I do not think this sort of thing is really the way to go. In any event, it does have very high production values, and the HDX version certainly conveyed them well. The Bach piece in the audio's rear channels certainly conveyed the refined pain of being a young billionaire with emotional problems. The experience as a whole wasn't entirely seamless, but that's not Vudu's fault. Vudu's menu pages are so skewed to studio stuff that those looking for more challenging fare might be apt to throw up their hands too soon. Services like Mubi, FilmStruck and Fandor have far more of those types of offerings, but Vudu isn't completely lacking — it's just not immediately visible. Boutique distributors such as Oscilloscope, Kino Lorber and Magnolia have movies on the site. I was able to find, for instance, ""Ma,"" a very unusual dance-in-film directed by and starring Celia Rowlson-Hall, by doing a keyboard search in which, looking for something else, I'd put in the letters ""m"" and ""a."" Lucky, that."
0,2017-02-20," FORDLÂNDIA, Brazil — The Amazon jungle already swallowed the Winding Brook Golf Course. Floods ravaged the cemetery, leaving behind a stockpile of concrete crosses. The 100-bed hospital designed by the acclaimed Detroit architect Albert Kahn? Plunderers destroyed it. Given the scale of decay and decrepitude in this town — founded in 1928 by the industrialist Henry Ford in the far reaches of the Amazon River Basin — I didn't expect to come across the stately, largely well-preserved homes on Palm Avenue. But there they were, thanks to the squatters. ""This street was a looters' paradise, with thieves taking furniture, doorknobs, anything the Americans left behind,"" said Expedito Duarte de Brito, 71, a retired milkman who dwells in one of the homes built for Ford managers in what was planned to be a utopian plantation town. ""I thought, 'Either I occupy this piece of history or it joins the other ruins of Fordlândia.'"" In more than a decade of reporting from Latin America, I made dozens of trips to the Amazon, lured back time and again by its vast rivers, magnificent skies, boomtowns, lost civilizations and tales of hubris consumed by nature. But somehow I never got to Fordlândia. That finally changed when I boarded a riverboat this year in Santarém, an outpost at the confluence of the Amazon and Tapajós rivers, and made the six-hour trip to the place where Ford, one of the world's richest men, tried turning a colossal swath of Brazilian jungle into a Midwest fantasyland. I explored the outpost on foot, wandering the ruins and talking to gold prospectors, farmers and descendants of plantation workers who live here. Hardly a lost city, Fordlândia is home to about 2,000 people, some who live in the crumbling structures built nearly a century ago. Ford, the automobile manufacturer who is considered a founder of American industrial mass-production methods, hatched his plan for Fordlândia in a bid to produce his own source of the rubber needed for making tires and car parts like valves, hoses and gaskets. In doing so, he waded into an industry shaped by imperialism and claims of botanical subterfuge. Brazil was home to Hevea brasiliensis, the coveted rubber tree, and the Amazon Basin had boomed from 1879 to 1912 as industries in North America and Europe fed the demand for rubber. But to the dismay of Brazil's leaders, Henry Wickham, a British botanist and explorer, had spirited thousands of Hevea seeds out of Santarém, providing the genetic stock for rubber plantations in British, Dutch and French colonies in Asia. These endeavors on the other side of the world devastated Brazil's rubber economy. But Ford despised relying on the Europeans, fearing a proposal by Winston Churchill to create a rubber cartel. So, in a move that pleased Brazilian officials, Ford acquired a giant stretch of land in the Amazon. From the start, ineptitude and tragedy plagued the venture, meticulously documented in a book by the historian Greg Grandin that I read on the boat as it made its way up the Tapajós. Disdainful of experts who could have advised them on tropical agriculture, Ford's men planted seeds of questionable value and let leaf blight ravage the plantation. Despite such setbacks, Ford constructed an American-style town, which he wanted inhabited by Brazilians hewing to what he considered American values. Employees moved into clapboard bungalows — designed, of course, in Michigan — some of which are still standing. Streetlamps illuminated concrete sidewalks. Portions of these footpaths persist in the town, near red fire hydrants, in the shadow of decaying dance halls and crumbling warehouses. ""It turns out Detroit isn't the only place where Ford produced ruins,"" said Guilherme Lisboa, 67, the owner of a small inn called the Pousada Americana. Beyond producing rubber, Ford, an avowed teetotaler, anti-Semite and skeptic of the Jazz Age, clearly wanted life in the jungle to be more transformative. His American managers forbade consumption of alcohol, while promoting gardening, square dancing and readings of the poetry of Emerson and Longfellow. Going even further in Ford's quest for utopia, so-called sanitation squads operated across the outpost, killing stray dogs, draining puddles of water where malaria-transmitting mosquitoes could multiply and checking employees for venereal diseases. ""With a surety of purpose and incuriosity about the world that seems all too familiar, Ford deliberately rejected expert advice and set out to turn the Amazon into the Midwest of his imagination,"" Mr. Grandin, the historian, wrote in his account of the town. These days, the ruins of Fordlândia stand as testament to the folly of trying to bend the jungle to the will of man. Seeking to promote the automobile as a form of recreation — along with the golf course, tennis courts, a movie theater and swimming pools — managers laid out nearly 30 miles of roads around Fordlândia. But cars are mostly absent on the town's muddy lanes, eclipsed by the motorbikes found in towns across the Amazon. By the end of World War II, it was clear that cultivating rubber trees around Fordlândia could not be profitable in the face of leaf blight and competition from synthetic rubber and Asian plantations freed from Japanese domination. After Ford turned the town over to Brazil's government in 1945, officials transferred Fordlândia from one public agency to another, largely for unsuccessful experiments in tropical agriculture. The town went into a seemingly perpetual state of decline. ""Nothing happens here, and that's how I like it,"" said Joaquim Pereira da Silva, 73, a farmer from Minas Gerais State who followed his star to Fordlândia in 1997. Now he lives on Palm Avenue in an old American house he bought for 20,000 reais (about $6,670) from a squatter who fixed it up. ""The Americans had no idea about rubber but they knew how to build things to last,"" he said. Something about the failed utopia strikes a chord with scholars and artists in other parts of the world. Fordlândia inspired a 2008 album by the Icelandic composer Johann Johannsson and a 1997 novel by Eduardo Sguiglia about an Argentine adventurer who travels here to recruit plantation laborers. Some descendants of workers who settled in Fordlândia, along with new migrants from other parts in Brazil, have small plots where zebu cattle graze. Others plant manioc in areas where rubber trees were chopped down decades ago. Many survive on small social welfare payments or pensions. Then there are residents like Eduardo Silva dos Santos, born 66 years ago in the hospital conceived by Kahn, the architect who designed much of 20th-century Detroit. Mr. dos Santos now lives in a small house near the hospital's ruins. Scavenging material left by the Americans, he fashioned a fishing lantern from old car parts and a spice grinder from discarded machinery. Mr. dos Santos expressed mixed views of Fordlândia under American stewardship, growing up in the years after Ford unloaded the town. ""This place in Ford's day was clean, no insects, no animals, no jungle in the town,"" said Mr. dos Santos, one of 11 children born to a family that depended on the rubber plantation. ""My father worked for them,"" he said, ""and he did what they ordered him to do. Workers are like dogs: They obey."" But to Ford's dismay, sometimes they didn't obey. Managers tried enforcing the alcohol prohibition, but workers simply hopped on boats to a so-called island of innocence nearby with bars and brothels. And in 1930, workers fed up with eating Ford's diet of oatmeal, canned peaches and brown rice in a sweltering dining hall staged a full-scale riot. They smashed time clocks, cut electricity to the plantation and chanted, ""Brazil for Brazilians; kill all the Americans,"" forcing some of the managers to decamp into the jungle. The Amazon offered its own challenges to the Americans. Some couldn't adapt to the conditions here, suffering nervous breakdowns. One drowned when a storm on the Tapajós River toppled his boat. Another manager left after three of his children died from tropical fevers. Ford might have avoided such tragedies, and the ruinous management of the plantation, if he had sought counsel from specialists in caring for rubber trees or scholars of the Amazon's capacity to thwart grandiose ventures. But he seemed to abhor learning from the past. ""History is bunk,"" Ford told The New York Times in 1921. ""What difference does it make how many times the ancient Greeks flew their kites?"""
1,2017-02-20," PHOENIX — A package arrived recently for Eric Thames at Maryvale Baseball Park, the spring training home of the Milwaukee Brewers. It was a fungo bat, thin-handled and light, a tool to help make his hands quicker. Thames had ordered it for $30 on Amazon. ""I opened the box and I was taking the bar code off it, and the clubhouse guy was like, 'Hey, did you buy that bat?'"" said Thames, who replied that he had. ""He says: 'You know, this is the big leagues. I have fungoes back there I can give you.'"" Thames laughed. He was, indeed, in a major league clubhouse, with an eight-figure contract and a team that was counting on him. He was not in South Korea anymore. ""I was so embarrassed,"" Thames said. ""I was like: 'It's been a while. Just give me a few weeks to adapt.'"" For the last three years, Thames adapted just fine with the NC Dinos of the Korea Baseball Organization. A marginal major leaguer for Toronto and Seattle in 2011 and 2012, Thames erupted for the Dinos, hitting .348 and averaging 41 homers and 126 R.B.I. His on-base plus slugging percentage was 1.171; the career major league record, held by Babe Ruth, is 1.164. Thames is not Babe Ruth. But the rebuilding Brewers believe he's a better value than Chris Carter, the slugger he replaces at first base. Last season Carter hit .222 with 206 strikeouts — but tied for the National League lead in homers, with 41. That put him in line to be awarded perhaps $10 million in salary arbitration. The Brewers let him go, and Carter eventually signed with the Yankees for $3.5 million. Thames did much better on the open market, getting a three-year, $16 million deal from the Brewers with a club option for 2020. They don't quite know how his production will translate, but the possibilities are enticing. ""We expect a productive major league player,"" said David Stearns, the Brewers' general manager. ""That can take shape in a variety of ways. With a signing like this, there's a fairly wide variance of potential outcomes, and we think there's a lot of upside there. We're going to put him in a comfortable environment that will allow him to adjust back to major league baseball, and hopefully his talents will take over."" Thames, 30, has played 181 games in the majors, with a .250 average and 21 homers. He has just three major league stolen bases, but stole 40 for the Dinos in 2015. He has a .296 on-base percentage in the majors, but had a .450 mark in the K.B.O., where ballparks tend to be small and the talent level is considered to be below that of the Japanese league. The Brewers did not scout Thames in person, but did study him extensively on video. Pitchers feared Thames and rarely challenged him with fastballs, but he displayed discipline at the plate, laying off junk and waiting for breaking balls he could mash. The pitch patterns will be different now, but the Brewers believe Thames can handle them. ""He's going to see more consistent velocity than he's seen the past couple of years, but I think he's frankly looking forward to that,"" Stearns said. ""It's a more normal style of hitting than constantly trying to guess which shade of breaking ball he's going to see."" Thames is eager for those fastballs, and everything else about the major league life. He made good money in South Korea — about $3.5 million, plus a Kia Sorento for winning the Most Valuable Player Award in 2015. But some of the game's customs there grew tiresome, like the emphasis on bunting and the practice of dressing in full uniform at the hotel before road games. And while Thames had a few American teammates, communication with others was limited. Thames was essentially his own hitting coach with the Dinos, and reinvented his approach. He watched interviews on technique with stars like the Detroit sluggers Miguel Cabrera and Victor Martinez, absorbing their lessons and teaching himself a new swing after finding his old one too inconsistent. ""I'd be very uphill, so a lot of balls I'd hit would have topspin,"" Thames said. ""If I got it perfect, it'd be a home run, but if I just missed it a little bit, topspin, so it would be off the wall or even knuckle and it wouldn't travel as far. Now I work hard to stay short to the ball but have a flat path — finish flat, not just try to be up there hitting dingers all day."" By not swinging for the fences, Thames began clearing them regularly. As a left-handed-hitting first baseman with power, a thick beard and a relatively short frame (6 feet), Thames recalls a former Brewer, Prince Fielder. His path to Milwaukee was just a lot less conventional. ""Eric's in a sweet spot for all this,"" said Craig Counsell, the Brewers' manager. ""He's got something to prove, and I think he feels that. That's a really good place to be for players, when they feel they've got something to prove."" Only one returning Brewer, Ryan Braun, hit 20 home runs last season, so the team needs Thames's power. Counsell said he was also intrigued by Thames's potential on the basepaths; the Brewers went 73-89 last season but easily led the majors in steals. Some players, like Jung Ho Kang in Pittsburgh, have starred in the K.B.O. and adapted well to the major league game. Others, like Byung Ho Park in Minnesota, have flopped. Thames has not set statistical goals for the season; there are too many pitchers to learn and decode, he said, and all he can do is work diligently to apply his skills. If he fails, he will be severely overpaid. If he succeeds, the Brewers will have a bargain. After fourth-place finishes the last two seasons, they need Thames to help plot their road map to contention. ""This year will be the year that informs us the most about where we really are on the timeline for competing,"" said Mark Attanasio, the Brewers' principal owner. ""This team will tell us."""

1,2017-02-22," SAN FRANCISCO — In 2011, Brett King was promoting his book, ""Breaking Banks,"" and creating a start-up that he hoped would do to the banks what Amazon did to the retail industry and Facebook did to media. ""We had grand ideas of being the Facebook of banking, and being a new form of bank account,"" Mr. King said recently. Six years later, his company, Moven, has opened only 60,000 of those new bank accounts. Mr. King has now transitioned to selling his software to the banks he once scorned, who use it as a component of their mobile apps. ""We realized that if you want millions of users as a bank, it is a very different proposition than building a social media network,"" he said. Silicon Valley has upended a growing number of industries, and it had seemed not too long ago that Wall Street would soon be next. A flurry of financial start-ups rose quickly and grabbed billions of dollars in investments. Mr. King is just one of the many technology entrepreneurs who have since recently run into the enormous moats that surround and protect the existing financial industry. The venture capitalists who have invested billions of dollars in this wave of new financial technology — think Venmo and Bitcoin — have been left waiting for a breakout star that actually looks like a threat to even a part of the big banks' business. ""A lot of people set out saying, 'We are going to displace the banks,'"" said Sheel Mohnot, a venture capitalist at 500 Startups who focuses on financial technology. ""We realized along the way that you really have no choice but to work with the banks."" And the difficulty of denting the influence and power of the big banks is only likely to get harder under the Trump administration. President Trump has said he wants to encourage innovation and new business by cutting back on regulations of all sorts, including financial regulations. Yet it was the regulations passed after the financial crisis that forced the big banks to reduce their risks in many areas and provided an opening for start-ups like Moven, which were willing to take more risks. Mr. Trump's plan to dismantle those post-crisis regulations is widely expected to give the big banks more free rein and close the window of opportunity for newcomers. ""The degree to which banks have been caught under the yoke of regulatory obligations is very likely to lighten up under Trump,"" said Arjan Schütte, the founder of the venture capital firm Core Innovation Capital, which focuses on financial technology. Mr. Schütte has been moving his firm's investments away from bank disrupters and toward start-ups that are set up to partner with existing financial institutions. Even if there has not been a disruption of the big banks, basic financial services available to consumers are changing rapidly, nonetheless. Americans are now able to send each other money instantly from their phones, thanks to Venmo, and can get approved for a loan in minutes, also from their phone. The consulting firm McKinsey estimated in a report last month that digital disruption could put $90 billion, or 25 percent of bank profits, at risk over the next three years as services become more automated and more tellers are replaced by chatbots. Much of this change, however, is now expected to come from the banks themselves as they absorb new ideas from the technology world and shrink their own operations, without necessarily losing significant numbers of customers to start-ups. Venmo, for, instance, has captured the wallets of many young Americans, but the largest banks have all begun their own versions of the service and some of them say that they already process, as single banks, more instant personal payments than Venmo. The large banks are also teaming up to start a cross-industry mobile phone application, Zelle, that will take Venmo head-on in 2017. Venmo, which was acquired by PayPal, is still trying to find a way to make money from the business, which is currently offered primarily as a free service. Financial start-ups are not facing the same challenges everywhere in the world. In China, the technology company Ant Financial has grown to 450 million users since spinning off from the e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014. Ant Financial now processes a majority of online payments in China. Ant Financial has used its position as an electronic, phone-based wallet to grab lots of other financial business from Chinese consumers, offering online loans, insurance and investment advice to its hundreds of millions of customers. China has four of the five most valuable financial technology start-ups in the world, according to CB Insights, with Ant Financial leading the way at $60 billion. And investments in financial technology rose 64 percent in China last year, while they were falling 29 percent in the United States, according to CB Insights. In Africa, the financial industry has been shaken up by the rise of new forms of mobile phone-based payment systems like M-Pesa, in Kenya, which was started by the local mobile phone operator rather than a bank, and has risen to become the dominant form of payment in the country. The obvious reason that financial start-ups have not achieved the same level of growth in the United States is that most Americans already have access to a relatively functional set of financial products, unlike in Africa and China. Some start-ups looked at becoming banks, so they could offer deposit insurance — among other things — but they generally found that getting a bank charter required more time and money than is available to even the most successful start-ups. This left most start-ups reliant on banks to hold and move any money they collected from customers. ""Operating in America, you needed to get a gatekeeper to approve your access to the networks,"" said Josh Reich, who sold his banking start-up, Simple, to the Spanish banking giant BBVA. ""If we wanted to touch their money, we needed to be part of the banking system."" Online lenders were particularly ambitious in trying to take on the banks from outside the system. Lending Club, which makes personal loans, and OnDeck, which focuses on small business loans, initially grew swiftly and went public, but both companies have run up against the limits of how fast a lending business can grow without being a bank. The online lenders have struggled with the high cost of acquiring new customers through marketing, which is not as necessary in other industries that have been disrupted by technology. At a more fundamental level, online lenders realized how hard it was to fund the new loans they wanted to give out without having access to cheap deposits, as the banks do. The shares of both Lending Club and OnDeck are now trading far below where they were on the day they went public. One notable success among the new lenders has been SoFi, or Social Finance, but even it has captured only about 250,000 customers, as compared to the 160 million users of Snapchat, the social network that was founded the same year. Start-ups focused on improving payments have had more success — the most valuable recent American technology start-up is Stripe, which helps new companies accept online payments. But Stripe and other payment start-ups like Square are all built on top of the existing credit card and banking infrastructure and have not posed any type of fundamental threat or challenge to the existing giants. ""We are explicitly not a threat to the banks,"" Tim Drinan, a spokesman for Stripe, said. ""From our perspective the banks and card networks have built something pretty good and pretty hard to replicate."" Perhaps the most ambitious recent project aimed at upending the banks was Bitcoin, which promised a new way to hold and move money, totally outside the existing banking system. The virtual currency has not taken off as a way to hold and spend money on a day-to-day basis, as many of its enthusiasts had predicted. At the same time, in a pattern that has been repeated elsewhere in the financial industry, the big banks have been making big investments aimed at harnessing the technology underlying Bitcoin — known as the blockchain — for their own purposes. Tim Swanson, an early Bitcoin follower and analyst who now works with the blockchain consulting firm R3, said that Bitcoin wasn't able to fulfill the marketing promises that were made for it back in 2012. ""It may take some time, but if there is anyone that has the capital base and the developer base to see this through, it's the banks for sure,"" Mr. Swanson said."
0,2017-02-23," How about a show that combines some of the better aspects of ""Mr. Robot,"" ""Fargo"" and ""The Americans"" — in a comedy? Would that pique your peak-TV interest? Comparing ""Patriot,"" a 10-episode series available Friday on Amazon, to three of the most distinctive series on television is overselling it, but not by a drastic amount. Created by the screenwriter Steven Conrad (""The Pursuit of Happyness,"" ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty""), ""Patriot"" is a spy-thriller sendup that combines dark humor and rueful whimsicality in a way that is both endearing and unsettling. In its focus on tone — and its close identification with a wounded young male protagonist, in this case a spy who would really rather be a folk singer — the show recalls a less claustrophobic ""Mr. Robot."" In its baroque plotting and exploration of the comic possibilities of violence, it is reminiscent of a slightly less stylized ""Fargo."" The connection to ""The Americans"" is more tenuous, but ""Patriot"" manages, despite its essential absurdity, to give the appearance of telling a credible story of international espionage. Instead of going in the direction of dystopian thriller (""Mr. Robot""), morality play (""Fargo"") or family drama (""The Americans""), however, ""Patriot"" goes for a peculiar brand of earnest farce. John Tavner, played by Michael Dorman, a New Zealand-born actor new to American TV, begins the series in a funk because he has mistakenly killed a male hotel maid instead of the rogue physicist who was his target. Baked and moping in Amsterdam, he writes a plaintive song about his blunder: ""Wondering why there are male hotel maids in other countries/You never see that/Never see that."" Before John can go all the way down the rabbit hole of guilt and shame, he is rescued by his father — who happens to be America's ""director of intelligence"" and is played by the wonderful Terry O'Quinn — and sent on a new mission, which, like his earlier one, is aimed at stopping Iran from gaining nuclear weapons. It involves adopting a cover as an employee of a Midwestern pipe company, something John is perilously unequipped for, as a way to deliver large sums of money to allies in Luxembourg. The mission goes wrong, in an escalating series of disasters that include a violent confrontation with a family of Brazilian wrestlers and a crucial operative's dropping dead after a racquetball match. Sometimes the humor goes from farcical to purely physical and visual, as in a joke involving the physiognomy of the Canadian character actor Julian Richings (known for playing Death in ""Supernatural""). The pilot, which was posted more than a year ago, gets the show's combination of black humor and wistful family dynamics just right. Exercises in sustained tone are tricky, though, and subsequent episodes (five were available for review) are less even. A reliance on long close-ups of pensive faces, and Mr. Conrad's fetish for scenes of group urination, start to pall. When the framework sags, you fall back on the casting: Mr. O'Quinn, and Kurtwood Smith as John's skeptical boss at the pipe company, effortlessly embody the delicate balancing act Mr. Conrad is attempting."
0,2017-02-24," COLONIA BERLIN, Bolivia — A few months ago, a representative from Cargill traveled to this remote colony in Bolivia's eastern lowlands in the southernmost reaches of the vast Amazon River basin with an enticing offer. The American agricultural giant wanted to buy soybeans from the Mennonite residents, descendants of European peasants who had been carving settlements out of the thick forest for more than 40 years. The company would finance a local warehouse and weighing station so farmers could sell their produce directly to Cargill on-site, the man said, according to local residents. One of those farmers, Heinrich Janzen, was clearing woodland from a 37-acre plot he bought late last year, hustling to get soy in the ground in time for a May harvest. ""Cargill wants to buy from us,"" said Mr. Janzen, 38, as bluish smoke drifted from heaps of smoldering vegetation. His soy is in demand. Cargill is one of several agricultural traders vying to buy from soy farmers in the region, he said. Cargill confirmed the accounts of colony residents, and said the company was still assessing whether it would source from the community. That decision would depend on a study of the area's productivity and land titles, said Hugo Krajnc, Cargill's corporate affairs leader for the Southern Cone, based in Argentina. ""But if a farmer has burned down its forest we'll not source from that grower,"" he said. A decade after the ""Save the Rainforest"" movement forced changes that dramatically slowed deforestation across the Amazon basin, activity is roaring back in some of the biggest expanses of forests in the world. That resurgence, driven by the world's growing appetite for soy and other agricultural crops, is raising the specter of a backward slide in efforts to preserve biodiversity and fight climate change. In the Brazilian Amazon, the world's largest rain forest, deforestation rose in 2015 for the first time in nearly a decade, to nearly two million acres from August 2015 to July 2016. That is a jump from about 1.5 million acres a year earlier and just over 1.2 million acres the year before that, according to estimates by Brazil's National Institute for Space Research. Here across the border in Bolivia, where there are fewer restrictions on land clearance, deforestation appears to be accelerating as well. About 865,000 acres of land have been deforested, on average, annually for agriculture since 2011, according to estimates from the nongovernmental Bolivia Documentation and Information Center, an area nearly the equivalent of Rhode Island in size. That figure has risen from about 366,000 acres a year, on average, in the 1990s and 667,000 acres a year in the 2000s. Now, a new study by an environmental advocacy group points to fresh indications of large-scale forest-clearing by Bolivian and Brazilian farmers who trade soybeans with Cargill. That organization, Washington-based Mighty Earth, used satellite imaging and supply-chain mapping information from the Stockholm Environment Institute, an environmental think tank, to identify deforestation in Brazil where two American-based food giants, Cargill and Bunge, are the only known agricultural traders. The supply-chain mapping by the environmental institute uses customs, shipment and storage data, as well as production data from Brazilian municipalities to trace agricultural exports back to producers. According to Mighty Earth's analysis, the Brazilian savanna areas in which Cargill operates, a region called the Cerrado, saw more than 321,000 acres of deforestation between 2011 and 2015. Mighty Earth also linked Bunge, the other agricultural giant, to more than 1.4 million acres from 2011 to 2015. In Bolivia, where supply-chain mapping is not available, Mighty Earth sent employees to areas where Cargill operates. The organization used drones to record the clearing of forests and savannas in areas where Cargill operates silos. The study was funded by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation and a nongovernmental organization, Rainforest Foundation Norway. A reporter for The New York Times independently traveled to remote areas of Bolivia described in the environmentalists' report and interviewed farmers engaged in deforestation who said they sold soy to Cargill. The farmers described what they called Cargill's push to increase its purchases of locally produced soy and its attempts to enhance bonds with local producers. The reports of fresh deforestation come despite a landmark deal signed three years ago by Cargill and other companies that included a target of ""eliminating deforestation from the production of agricultural commodities like palm oil, soy and beef products by 2020."" Experts at the time said the deadline, laid out in the New York Declaration of Forests, would require companies to start straightaway to make their sourcing more sustainable. Both Cargill and Bunge said the report seemed to inflate its role in the region's deforestation. Cargill's share of soy in the Bolivia municipalities in which it operates came to about 8 percent, Cargill said. Meanwhile, in Brazil's Matopiba region, Bunge's share was about 20 percent, the company said. And soy is just one crop behind deforestation, said Stewart Lindsay, Bunge's vice president for global corporate affairs. ""One company alone cannot solve this issue,"" Mr. Lindsay said. ""A positive step would be for more companies to adopt zero deforestation commitments, apply controls to block crops grown in illegally cleared areas from entering their supply chains, report publicly on progress and invest millions of dollars to support sustainable land use planning efforts, all of which Bunge has done."" (Bunge, however, is not a signatory to the New York Declaration of Forests.) In an interview, Cargill chief executive David MacLennan said the company was studying the allegations of deforestation in Bolivia and Brazil linked to the company. ""If there's something there, if it's substantiated, we'll do something about it,"" Mr. MacLennan said. ""If that's accurate, it's not acceptable. ""We're going to honor our obligations and our commitments,"" he continued. ""We've committed to ending deforestation and to do our part in ending deforestation. Our word is our bond."" Forest loss is detrimental to the earth's climate. The clearing of woodlands and the fires that accompany it generate one-tenth of all global warming emissions, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists, making the loss of forests one of the biggest single contributors to climate change. Only about 15 percent of the world's forest cover remains intact, according to the World Resources Institute. The rest has been cleared, degraded or is in fragments, wiping out ecosystems and displacing indigenous communities, scientists say. Behind the rise in deforestation is a strategy by multinational food companies to source their agricultural commodities from ever more remote areas around the world. These areas tend to be where legal protections of forests are weakest. The Brazilian Amazon, a poster child for the global forest-conservation movement, has enjoyed increasing protections, like a moratorium announced in 2006 on forest clearing for soy production. Between that time and 2015, Brazil reduced Amazon deforestation by almost two-thirds, according to estimates by Mongabay, the environmental news site, based on data from the Brazilian National Institute of Space Research and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. The uptick in forest loss since then, however, has raised concerns that the progress is far from secure. Brazil was aware of the challenge of keeping deforestation at bay, Everton Lucero, the secretary of climate change and forests of Brazil's Ministry of the Environment, said in an interview. ""We are very uncomfortable with the bad news that we had a rise in deforestation, and we are taking every possible measure to reverse it next year,"" Mr. Lucero said. Budget shortfalls amid Brazil's recent economic and political turmoil, he said, had wreaked havoc with its policing of its rain forests. When traveling to remote regions, ""Sometimes our command and control units were without fuel for helicopters,"" he said. ""Hopefully we are on a recovery path."" Bolivia, on the other hand, presents a different situation. President Evo Morales, a socialist, has made securing ""food sovereignty"" a major part of his agenda, driving Bolivia's agricultural expansion. There are relatively few forest protections, and the government's Forestry and Land Authority is tasked with the potentially conflicting roles of regulating land use, forestry and agriculture, and issuing concessions for logging and farming. The landlocked country has declared that it expects to clear almost 14 million more acres of forest by 2025, to convert into farmland. Bolivia's greenhouse gas emissions levels per capita exceed that of many European countries, despite having a far lower per capita income. Deforestation is responsible for more than 80 percent of Bolivia's total carbon dioxide emissions, according to a recent study by researchers at Insead, a graduate school based in Fontainebleau, France. A major culprit is the cultivation of soy, which has jumped more than 500 percent in Bolivia since 1991, to 3.8 million hectares in 2013, according to the most recent agricultural censuses. Little of that soy is consumed domestically. The vast majority is processed and exported as animal feed in a commodities trade that serves a global appetite for hamburgers, chicken and pork. ""The forest is seen as useless land that needs to be made useful,"" said Nataly Ascarrunz, executive director of the Bolivian Institute of Forestry Investigation, a Bolivian nongovernmental organization that monitors and researches the country's forests. ""There's a lot of pressure for economic development,"" Ms. Ascarrunz said. ""When resources are flowing, production is happening and people have work. It's very hard to argue with that."" Victor Yucra, the director general of Bolivia's forest and land management at the Forestry and Land Authority, stressed the need for the Bolivian government to balance the protection of its forests with the needs of its agricultural sector. ""Our concern is in ensuring that intensive agricultural production takes place within a framework that also provides for sustainable forestry and protection for standing forests,"" Mr. Yucra said. Mr. MacLennan, the chief executive of Cargill, described a business trip to Brazil last year, during which he saw the Amazon from a plane window. ""You look down and you see this beautiful forest,"" he said. ""Kilometers and kilometers of forest. But you also see these big chunks of dirt. ""The brown really contrasts with the green,"" he continued, comparing the forest and deforested areas. ""When you see it, it's like, 'Holy cow. That's what's happened.' It just hit me when I saw it in broad daylight — the impact the deforestation has."" Mr. MacLennan initially garnered praise among environmentalists for pledging to extend the no-deforestation pledge it had made regarding palm oil to cover every commodity the company handles. Cargill's commitment was called one of the most sweeping environmental pledges ever made by a large agricultural company. It earned Mr. MacLennan a photo opportunity with Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general at the time. Even before the New York Declaration, Cargill had made significant efforts to buy palm oil sourced only from land not linked to fresh deforestation, according to a supply-chain expert with extensive experience working on Cargill's global sustainability efforts. The expert spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying that to do so openly would jeopardize professional relations with the company. Cargill continued to invest millions of dollars adding extra staff members and hiring third-party auditors to verify that the palm oil was coming from established fields, not farmland freshly carved from the forest, he said. But Cargill has been less aggressive with other commodities, he said. Part of the issue was Cargill's decentralized setup, the expert said. Another problem was the resistance from commodities traders, whose incentive is to seek supplies from as many sources as possible in order to drive down costs. Buying only sustainably grown commodities would mean a more limited supply. Now, environmental groups accuse Cargill of backtracking on its 2020 deadline. In recent statements, Cargill has adopted a 2030 deadline for elimination of deforestation from its supply chain — a separate deadline, mentioned elsewhere in the New York Declaration, that was meant to apply to ending all forms of deforestation, not just those related to agricultural commodities. ""They're willfully misinterpreting the Declaration,"" said Glenn Hurowitz, chief executive of Mighty Earth. ""They're breaking their own pledge."" Cargill is committed, Mr. MacLennan said, to eliminating by 2020 deforestation from its production of palm oil, a commodity widely used in food, detergents and cosmetics. But, he said, Cargill had always understood the declaration to give all signatories until 2030 to tackle deforestation. ""I don't think I or others appreciated the vast complexity of the task,"" Mr. MacLennan said. ""Let's say that we are trading or buying and selling soybean meal. Where did the soybeans come from? And did they come from deforested land? Maybe we weren't buying the soybeans directly. I don't know."" Holly Gibbs, an expert in tropical deforestation and agriculture at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, called the 2030 deadline interpretation devastating. ""If we were to wait until 2030,"" Ms. Gibbs said, ""there would be no forest left."" In Mr. Janzen's newly cleared field, a long strip of land flanked by vivid vegetation, blue-white smoke drifted from a smoldering landscape. The German-speaking Mennonites, who live amid horse-drawn buggies and farmhouses that wouldn't look out of place in rural Ohio or Pennsylvania, trace their origins to 16th-century Protestant reformists who migrated to Russia, the United States, Canada, Belize and Mexico in search of farming opportunities and religious freedom. Some moved to Bolivia in the last century, and about 57,000 Mennonites now live in 55 secluded settlements here, eschewing some aspects of 21st century technology, like modern cars, but enthusiastically embracing others, such as tractors and genetically modified seeds. Their trade with companies like Cargill has transformed their communities into a bloc of relatively prosperous landowners. But in recent years, they have also been targeted by land reforms enacted by Mr. Morales, who has pledged to reverse the centuries of subjugation of Bolivia's indigenous majority. The farmer, Mr. Janzen, with the help of two laborers, spent the day digging roots from the earth, between smoking woodpiles. There was a brown jumble of slender trees, saplings, shrubs, bushes, vines and roots. Occasional larger trees showed gashes where the bulldozer first made contact, pushing them to the ground. Farther downfield lay more long, neat cordons of debris, waiting to be burned. ""If the rain holds off, I'll burn the rest tomorrow,"" he said."
0,2017-02-25," SAN FRANCISCO — Sitting in a basement office that she rents by the hour, Shannon Coulter ticks off the activities she gave up in defiance of President Donald J. Trump: renting movies with her husband on Amazon, and shopping at Nordstrom, Macy's and other retailers that sell Ivanka Trump's products. A Nordstrom bag sat on a nearby table. It represents a victory lap of sorts for Ms. Coulter, who has almost single-handedly spearheaded a retail revolt against the president and his family. She was wearing a new silver Elizabeth and James lariat necklace purchased at the department store soon after it scrubbed Ms. Trump's name from its website. ""The goal,"" Ms. Coulter said, ""came originally from a place of really wanting to shop the stores we loved again with a clear conscience."" It's been a wild ride these past few months for Ms. Coulter, who runs her shoestring movement from her home, or from cheerfully decorated work spaces like this one — surrounded by bright-blue furniture, clam chairs and decorative pillows that feel more Silicon Valley than anti-administration war room. Enraged by a video that emerged last October of Mr. Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women, Ms. Coulter began a boycott of any sort of product connected to Mr. Trump. At first, it was just a tweet — a list she had compiled of companies that sold Trump products — but the ember quickly turned into a coast-to-coast blaze. Thousands of people have contacted the stores Ms. Coulter has on her boycott list, including Macy's and Amazon. Retailers including Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and T.J. Maxx have backed away from products connected to Ms. Trump, the president's oldest daughter, since Ms. Coulter's efforts began. A herd of activists and celebrities, including the feminist writer Gloria Steinem, the Olympic diver Greg Louganis and the actress Lucy Lawless of ""Xena: Warrior Princess,"" have expressed support. The attention has transformed Ms. Coulter, 45, a digital marketing specialist, into the unlikely general of the digital army now supporting her campaign, Grab Your Wallet. ""People describe me as an activist in media coverage, I don't know who they're talking about,"" she said. ""I've never done anything this organized or structured or purposeful."" The new role has taken up much of her time, and has made her the target of criticism and attacks from Trump supporters. She's lost count of how many times she has been called a ""bully"" or a ""disgrace."" The abuse gets more menacing with each victory; a recent email included her mother's name in the subject line, with threats to publish more of her personal information. In the latest twist, the boycott has drawn Ms. Coulter, a self-described progressive liberal, into a growing debate over whether targeting Ms. Trump is sexist. And she said she worries that people will think she is profiting from the venture. Ms. Coulter was particularly upset when a knockoff ""Grab Your Wallet"" group sold clothing and other merchandise on Facebook. ""We don't even have a T-shirt, we don't have stickers, nothing,"" she said, adding that she does not accept compensation from companies, or donations. ""I don't think either of us envisioned that some of the things that have happened would happen,"" said Sue Atencio, who helped Ms. Coulter get the site started. In many ways, Ms. Coulter has embraced her new position. She answers emails at all hours and scours Twitter for tips on companies to add, or remove, from the boycott list. Then there are the phone calls — lots and lots of phone calls — from angry Trump supporters or journalists or the companies that want to get off her list. There is no doubt that it has changed her life. She doesn't sleep or socialize as often as she used to. Most of her work on Grab Your Wallet is done after she eats dinner with her husband, taking up what free time she has. ""She went underground, basically,"" said Amie Penwell, a fellow San Francisco resident who hasn't seen much of her friend of seven years recently. The negative attention has made Ms. Coulter careful about her privacy. She insisted on meeting at the work space for an interview, to avoid having a reporter at her home, out of fear that it could be targeted. She would not let her husband, whom she met online in 2010, be interviewed. Born in Indiana, Ms. Coulter studied journalism at Penn State. She said she began her career by ""piggybacking"" on the Bay Area's technology boom, helping start-ups with their email marketing. A year ago she started her own agency, DoubleKnown, which helps executives and small businesses build their online presence through blog posts, social media feeds and other digital tools. The company has one other employee and a handful of education and technology clients, but has stopped taking on new accounts since Grab Your Wallet took off. Political activism has not been a big part of Ms. Coulter's life since college, when she spoke at a rally raising awareness about violence against women. Her most recent organized effort came after the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon in 2015, when she circulated a list of lawmakers who had voted against tougher gun control measures. ""Maybe that gave me a taste of what something like this would be like,"" she said, describing herself as a chronic list maker. ""I like the efficiency of them."" After becoming incensed by the video, Ms. Coulter began searching retailers' websites for Trump-branded products and collecting the names on a spreadsheet. Wondering who else might be interested in a boycott, she looked at Twitter, and found Ms. Atencio, who had tweeted ""fashion not fascism.""Ms. Coulter contacted her and suggested they announce the boycott together. Since then, most of the work has fallen to Ms. Coulter, though she refers to Ms. Atencio as her ""spiritual guide"" and sounding board. Ms. Atencio, 59, sees herself as the less visible half of a musical duo. ""I feel like I'm the Garfunkel and Shannon is Paul Simon,"" Ms. Atencio said. Grab Your Wallet now includes a list of places to shop and not shop, and a short script for people who want to call companies to complain. As many as 32,000 people visit her site in an hour, Ms. Coulter said. When the women's marches took place across the country in January, 350,000 people arrived during a 24-hour period. In early February, Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus removed Ms. Trump's name from their websites. Employees at T.J. Maxx and Marshalls were instructed not to display Ivanka Trump products and to throw her signs in the trash. None of the retailers credited Grab Your Wallet with their decision — the department stores blamed poor sales — and it is not possible to know to what degree Ms. Coulter and her followers have influenced the companies' decision making. But in the waning days of January, Trump-related complaints, many of which mentioned Grab Your Wallet, were Nordstrom's most common customer feedback, according to a person with direct knowledge who was not authorized to speak publicly. Nordstrom said it did not have ""specific numbers"" on the number of customers it had heard from. ""I attribute it directly to the Muslim ban,"" Ms. Coulter said, referring to the executive order on immigration that Mr. Trump issued on Jan. 27. ""I can see when the numbers spike when certain news events happen."" Monitoring those spikes, updating her list and responding to emails, tweets and press inquiries have become Ms. Coulter's second full-time job. ""My life is so completely here,"" she said, gesturing to her MacBook, ""that it all just sort of overlaps and is an endless stream of emails and tweets and Facebook posts."" She does get some help from volunteers, like the woman who helps run the legitimate Grab Your Wallet Facebook group, which has more than 12,000 members. But for the most part, Ms. Coulter is on her own. That means the threats and negative attention are also directed largely at her. People ask her why she's ""attacking another woman,"" or call her a bully. People like the Fox host Jeanine Pirro have argued that Ms. Trump's brand has nothing to do with the White House, and that she is being unjustly targeted. Defenders also point to a proposed maternity policy that Ms. Trump developed with her father's campaign, and her brand's hashtag, WomenWhoWork, as examples of how she promotes women. ""We have to stop destroying women based on the men in their lives,"" Ms. Pirro said during a recent episode of her show. S.E. Cupp, a conservative author and commentator, stopped short of calling the boycott of Ms. Trump's products sexist. But in an email, Ms. Cupp said that it seemed ""misdirected."" ""I'm never a fan of going after the kids, grown or not, of presidents,"" she said. ""Nor does it feel consistent with the anti-Trump argument — that he's 'anti-woman' — to economically punish his daughter, a working wife and mother."" A spokesman for Ms. Trump's brand declined to make someone at the company available for an interview. In a statement, the company said it had been ""swept into the political fray, becoming collateral damage in others' efforts to advance agendas unrelated to what we do."" Ms. Coulter finds such comments perplexing. She pointed out that Ms. Trump moved to Washington and has taken on an informal advisory role in the White House. She frequently sits in on her father's meetings with foreign leaders. Ms. Trump's husband, the real estate developer Jared Kushner, is a top adviser to President Trump. In addition, Ms. Coulter said, Ms. Trump played a prominent role in the presidential campaign. ""Someone who passionately campaigned for a man who likes to grab women by the genitals will never convince me that she's on the side of women,"" she said. ""Ever."" Ms. Steinem also said that Ms. Trump was fair game, particularly after the election, when it can no longer be argued that she is just doing her ""filial duty"" on the campaign trail. ""It's appropriate to boycott her not because he is her father,"" Ms. Steinem said, ""but because she supports his policies."" Ms. Steinem specifically faulted Ms. Trump's proposed parental-leave policy for its exclusion of fathers and non-birth mothers. Despite the long hours, Ms. Coulter said she could continue running Grab Your Wallet indefinitely. She's considering turning the campaign into a nonprofit and running it full time, and is struggling to figure out what to do with her fledgling business. ""I'm trying to understand what the right next step is,"" she said. ""I think as long as he's in office, this will be alive."""

0,2017-03-02," Dozens of companies, including Amazon, Apple, IBM and Microsoft, have signed on to a Supreme Court brief supporting a transgender boy's fight against his school district over which school bathrooms he may use. The businesses, 53 in all, joined a brief that the Human Rights Campaign, a nonprofit organization supporting gay rights, planned to file on Thursday. The advocacy group is urging the Supreme Court to side with Gavin Grimm, a transgender student represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, in his case against the Gloucester County School Board in Virginia. ""These companies are sending a powerful message to transgender children and their families that America's leading businesses have their backs,"" Chad Griffin, the Human Rights Campaign's president, said in a statement announcing the support. With oral arguments scheduled for the end of the month, Mr. Grimm's case is progressing at the Supreme Court as the rights of transgender youth face increased scrutiny nationwide. In January, the Boy Scouts of America reversed a century-old stance, opening the door to transgender members. Last week, President Trump rescinded rules put in place less than a year earlier allowing transgender students to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity. Mr. Grimm's case could settle the bathroom issue once and for all. The signatories of the Human Rights Campaign brief include a number of tech companies, like Airbnb, eBay, Intel, LinkedIn, PayPal, Salesforce, Twitter, Yahoo and Yelp. But businesses from several other industries have signed on, too. They include Gap, MAC Cosmetics, Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance, Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams, Warby Parker and Williams-Sonoma. It is not the first time that big businesses have lent their support to the fight for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender rights. Last year, for example, the chief executives of dozens of major corporations wrote a letter to Pat McCrory, the North Carolina governor at the time, urging the state to repeal House Bill 2, which curbed legal protections for the gay community. A bipartisan effort has begun to repeal that bill."
1,2017-03-02," Russia, a daily fixture in the nation's headlines these days, will also figure prominently in Matthew Weiner's new series for Amazon. Called ""The Romanoffs,"" the drama will be an eight-episode anthology series about people who believe they are descendants of the titular former ruling family of Russia, Mr. Weiner said. The family, killed by Bolshevik revolutionaries in 1918, has been a popular subject of mystery lore, much of it positing that a daughter, Anastasia, escaped death and assumed a new identity. (The more common contemporary Anglicized spelling is ""Romanov."") The series will be Mr. Weiner's first since the end, in 2015, of his acclaimed drama ""Mad Men."" The new show was announced in October but details were scarce until Mr. Weiner discussed them in interviews posted Thursday by Variety and The Hollywood Reporter. ""We're at a place in our history where people are looking for a close connection to their roots, and for some kind of revelation about who they are,"" Weiner told Variety. ""There's great debate about who is a Romanoff and what happened to the Romanoffs. The story for me is that we're all questioning who we are and who we say we are."" Writing has begun on the show's eight episodes, which will cost around $50 million to produce. Each will feature self-contained stories — structurally closer to shows like ""The Twilight Zone"" or ""Black Mirror"" than contemporary anthology series that track a single narrative over the course of a season. Mr. Weiner will direct four of the eight episodes and ""be writing as many as possible and overseeing the writers room the same way I did on 'Mad Men,'"" he told The Hollywood Reporter. He has brought in several former ""Mad Men"" writers and producers and hopes to feature actors from that cast in ""The Romanoffs."" ""I'm basically trying to get every single person who was involved with that show,"" he said. ""As I said when 'Mad Men' ended, I want to work with these people for the rest of my life. But we have a lot of new people — or people new to us — as well."" ""The Romanoffs"" likely won't debut until next year, Mr. Weiner said. His first novel, ""Heather, the Totality,"" will be published by Little, Brown this fall."
0,2017-03-03," Scientists studying the Amazon rain forest are tangled in a debate of nature versus nurture. Many ecologists tend to think that before Europeans arrived in the Americas, the vast wilderness was pristine and untouched by humans. But several archaeologists argue that ancient civilizations once thrived in its thickets and played a role in its development. Now, researchers have found evidence that indigenous people may have domesticated and cultivated Amazonian plants and trees thousands of years ago, further supporting the idea that ancient humans helped shape the forest. ""Large areas of the Amazon are less pristine than we may think,"" said Hans ter Steege, a tropical ecologist at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in the Netherlands, and an author of a paper published in Science on Thursday. ""The people who lived there before Columbus left serious footprints that still persist in the composition as we see today."" He was one of more than a hundred researchers who found that domesticated tree and palm species — like cacao, cashews, the açaí palm, the Brazil nut and rubber — were five times more likely to dominate the modern Amazonian forest than nondomesticated plants. Carolina Levis, a doctoral student at the National Institute for Amazonian Research in Brazil and Wageningen University and Research Center in the Netherlands, was the lead author on the study. She and her team looked at a database from the Amazon Tree Diversity Network containing 1,170 plots of forest. Most plots measured approximately 2.5 acres each and had previously been investigated on foot by ecologists who counted and identified the plant species in the plots. Ms. Levis then identified 85 domestic plants to analyze. One way the team determined that a plant had been domesticated was a look at its fruit. They found, for example, some peach palms that bore fruit weighing 200 grams, or 0.44 pounds, when the fruit grown in the wild matured to about one gram. Several of the domesticated plants they identified are still grown by South Americans. Ms. Levis compared her list of 85 plants to another database of more than 3,000 archaeological sites, including ceramics, dirt mounds and rock paintings, dating back before the Spaniards and Portuguese arrived in the Americas 500 years ago. The domesticated plants flourished near the archaeological sites, far more so than nondomesticated ones. ""It's the first time that we show these correlations between plant species in the forest today and archaeological finds,"" she said. The findings suggest that either the ancient civilizations grew and cultivated the plants, or that they purposely settled in areas that had plants they could eat and use. Ms. Levis said she suspected that people were domesticating the plants, although the study did not definitively pinpoint how settlements were chosen. In some plots, more than half of the plant life consisted of domesticated trees and palms. Jennifer Watling, an archaeologist at the University of São Paulo, Brazil, who was not involved with the study, said in an email that ""the large number of data points sampled by these authors gives good reason to believe that the distribution of domesticated species in many areas of Amazonia is strongly linked to the actions of pre-Columbian societies."" But Crystal McMichael, a paleoecologist from the University of Amsterdam, said the database comparisons were not convincing. New direct evidence, like fossils of domesticated plants at the archaeological sites, would help advance such theories, she said. While the study shows a potential association between ancient people and modern forest composition, it does not preclude the possibility that the domesticated plant patterns occurred with more modern settlements, she said in an email. Dr. ter Steege disagreed. The study ""changed my view of the forest,"" he said. ""It's not only the ecology or the environment that created this forest, but also the people who lived there before."""
0,2017-03-08," WASHINGTON — Jeff Bezos, the billionaire chief executive of Amazon, founded a rocket company as a hobby 16 years ago. Now that company, Blue Origin, finally has its first paying customer as it ramps up to become a full-fledged business. Mr. Bezos announced that  customer, the satellite television provider Eutelsat, on Tuesday. In about five years, Eutelsat, which is based in Paris, will strap one of its satellites to a new Blue Origin rocket to be delivered to space, a process it has done dozens of times with other space partners. For Blue Origin, the relationship represents its evolution from an engineering-obsessed company into one that also seeks to make a profit eventually. That goal may be a moon shot, with high risks, high costs and no guarantee that enough customers need transportation beyond Earth. Blue Origin, based in Kent, Wash., has launched only its New Shepard rocket to the edge of space, 62 miles up, before returning to Earth. The commercial partnership brings Blue Origin closer in line with SpaceX, created by Elon Musk, which has been launching satellites and taking NASA cargo to the International Space Station for several years. Last week, SpaceX announced that two space tourists would pay to fly on a weeklong trip around the moon. The companies are part of a private sector space boom that has restored the United States' position in aerospace technology and exploration. Boeing, Lockheed Martin and other international commercial space companies are also competing with the tech entrepreneurs for business and government customers. Mr. Bezos, true to his approach in business ventures, is looking far into the future. ""The long-term vision is millions of people living and working in space,"" he said Tuesday during a speech at the Satellite 2017 conference in Washington. To make that happen, Blue Origin must take several intermediate steps, he said. It also needs to lower costs for launches by reusing rockets and other equipment, he added. We ""need to get to a place ultimately where it is much more like commercial airlines,"" Mr. Bezos said. New applications for satellites, including broadband internet, mapping and other services, have fueled more demand. Analysts said private rocket companies would fill a need to get those satellites into orbit in coming years. Blue Origin's deal with Eutelsat is a ""definite statement to the industry that Blue Origin will be a viable commercial launch vehicle,"" said Carissa Bryce Christensen, the chief executive of Bryce Space and Technology, a consulting firm. The large crowd to hear Mr. Bezos speak at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center on Tuesday illustrated renewed enthusiasm about the commercial space industry. Space has long been a pursuit of wealthy investors, and Mr. Bezos and Mr. Musk have captured the most public attention in recent years for their audacious visions. SpaceX is focused on reaching and inhabiting Mars. Blue Origin may be building a fleet of rockets to make deliveries to the moon and beyond. Mr. Bezos ""is investing because he wants to transform people's lives with space capabilities, but the expectation has always been that this will be a successful business,"" Ms. Christensen said. Those ambitions have many doubters who do not see how expensive rocket projects can become profitable. Even with a surge in satellite technologies and perhaps a growing space tourism industry, demand may not be sufficient to cover rocket companies' great costs for research, development and launches. ""You wouldn't get anything done without getting the dreamers out there, but how do you translate those dreams into a profitable business? That's very tricky,"" said Henry Hertzfeld, a research professor at the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. Blue Origin, which has more than 1,000 employees, has improved its technology to carry bigger payloads. A few months ago, the company began to court customers, and Eutelsat emerged as an ideal partner because it had experience working with first-time launch vehicles, Mr. Bezos said. Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket, named after the astronaut John Glenn, will be manufactured and launched at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. It is expected to be completed in 2020 and will be used to carry one of Eutelsat's geostationary satellites. No financial details of the partnership with Eutelsat were disclosed. In a video, Mr. Bezos revealed details about the rocket's BE-4 engine and showed how it could carry 50 tons of payload and land on a moving sea barge. ""Their solid engineering approach, and their policy to develop technologies that will form the base of a broad generation of launchers, corresponds to what we expect from our industrial partners,"" Rodolphe Belmer, Eutelsat's chief executive, said in a statement. Mr. Bezos said he was approaching his space project with an abundance of patience. ""I like to do things incrementally,"" he said, noting that Blue Origin's mascot is a tortoise. With such high costs and risks with each rocket launch, it is important not to skip steps, he said. ""Slow is smooth and smooth is fast,"" said Mr. Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post and a clock that will keep time for 10,000 years. ""I've seen this in every endeavor I've been in."""
0,2017-03-12," SEATTLE — There have been many opportunities to consider how crucial Amazon has become to the smooth operation of the internet over the past few years. The most recent involved a case of fat fingers. That event occurred late last month when an Amazon employee entered an incorrect set of commands on a computer, unintentionally knocking out a large set of servers in an Amazon data center in Northern Virginia and, with it, an array of online services from other companies. Among the many consequences of the shutdown: Users of the business messaging service Slack couldn't upload files. Photos on the technology news site The Verge didn't display. Quora, a popular question-and-answer site, couldn't be reached. It was a rare fumble for Amazon in cloud computing, in which companies pay to run their online applications in data centers operated by big providers. While would-be competitors snoozed, the internet retailer tiptoed into the business technology market over the past decade, becoming the dominant force in cloud computing. Its computing business, Amazon Web Services, hauled in $12.2 billion in revenue last year from customers ranging from Netflix to the C.I.A. Amazon's leading position has come with side effects. Its two biggest rivals — Microsoft and Google — are asleep no more. They and other technology companies have preached the benefits of working with multiple cloud providers — the kind of marketing message one would expect from underdogs in a category that could one day engulf the huge market for business software and hardware. Amazon's service interruption, though not nearly bad enough to spark a panic among customers, was viewed by some as a moment for reflection. ""It really is a wake-up call to enterprises,"" said Craig McLuckie, a former Google technologist who is now chief executive of Heptio, a start-up that makes software tools for more easily moving applications between clouds. ""They certainly need to understand to what level of dependency they have on a single provider."" Amazon's error was still fresh in people's minds last week at the Google Cloud Next conference, a jamboree for the search giant to show off its seriousness in cloud computing. At the beginning of her keynote speech, Diane Greene, Google Cloud's chief executive, boasted about how reliable Google's cloud service was last year. Taking a jab at Amazon, she quipped that ""so far, 2017 looks promising, too."" It was part of a barrage unleashed by Google to persuade potential customers that they should piggyback on the $30 billion of infrastructure investment it had made over the years. ""We're here for real; this is an incredibly serious mission,"" said Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet, Google's parent company. ""We have the money, means and commitment to pull off a new platform of computation globally for everyone who needs it."" But even big customers Google showcased at its conference emphasized the importance of not relying exclusively on one company. Darryl West, global chief information officer of HSBC, said at the event that the bank used Google, Amazon and Microsoft for cloud services, noting that each company has its strengths. Paul Gaffney, Home Depot senior vice president of information technology, who also spoke at the Google event, said, ""All of us have a role as consumers to drive competition so multi-cloud is a very important part of doing that."" Snap, the social networking company that popularized disappearing messages through its Snapchat service, recently revealed in filings for its initial public offering that it has committed to spending $2 billion over five years to use cloud computing services from Google. But Snap also revealed that it would spread the wealth around, committing $1 billion over five years to Amazon's cloud services. One fear among businesses is that Amazon's dominance could lead to a new form of ""lock-in,"" giving it huge leverage over customers because of the costs of switching providers. In the 1980s and 1990s, those costs helped Microsoft gain a seemingly unshakable grip on personal computing. Microsoft is betting that won't happen this time. ""This won't be a winner-take-all scenario,"" said Judson Althoff, executive vice president of Microsoft's worldwide commercial business. Although they have become credible competitors to Amazon in the past few years — especially Microsoft — the newcomers to cloud computing have a long way to go. In the fourth quarter, Amazon accounted for 40 percent of the worldwide market for public cloud services, compared with 11 percent for Microsoft and 6 percent for Google, which was tied for third place with IBM, according to Synergy Research Group. Disruptions like the one in late February in what Amazon calls its simple storage service remain rare, especially in relation to comparable computing services operated privately by companies within their own walls. Even with the problem, which lasted for about four hours, the Amazon storage service was up and running more than 99.98 percent of the time in the United States and Europe over the last 90 days, according to CloudHarmony, a cloud measurement service owned by the technology research firm Gartner. ""We will do everything we can to learn from this event and use it to improve our availability even further,"" Amazon said in a statement on its website detailing the episode. Lydia Leong, an analyst at Gartner, did not expect what transpired to cause a rush of companies to shift their cloud computing away from Amazon. She said it was highly unusual for companies to run the same application in more than one cloud because it introduced new complexities and costs. To avoid being knocked offline, companies can set up their applications to run in multiple regions, across the company's network of data centers. All of the big cloud providers offer volume discounts, the full benefits of which customers don't get to enjoy if they divide their use of cloud services among multiple providers. Still, there are some compelling reasons to use multiple providers, Ms. Leong said. Often companies rely mostly on Amazon for cloud service, while a specific development team inside the company familiar with Microsoft technologies will use Microsoft's Azure cloud service. A few years ago, Hearst, the media company, was exclusively using Amazon for cloud computing, but later added services from Microsoft and Google, said Philip R. Wiser, Hearst's chief technology officer. He said some of the company's internal online services had been affected by Amazon's interruption, but nothing the public would have noticed. Because it's relatively early in the emergence of cloud computing, Mr. Wiser said he believed it was important to spread one's bets around. ""Being multi-cloud as a company and having the skill and understanding of how to move between investments — that is an asset,"" he said. ""We have that as a stated mission for all of our infrastructure team."""

0,2017-03-13," For all of its famed redundancy, the internet at times can appear awfully fragile. Two weeks ago, an Amazon employee entered an incorrect set of commands on a computer, accidentally knocking out a good chunk of the servers at an Amazon data center in Virginia. The mistake brought down a number of websites and internet services. It was a reminder that no company is infallible — and that technology managers should think twice before becoming too dependent on one technology provider. Amazon Web Services is the dominant supplier of cloud-computing services to other companies. But the shutdown, which lasted a few hours for some customers, may be a talking point for competitors like Google, Microsoft and IBM. A.W.S. still has enviable uptime — better than 99 percent. But anything short of 100 percent offers an opening to competitors. As we have seen in the last year, the internet services we take for granted are not built upon an unbreakable foundation. In October, a so-called distributed denial of service attack targeted an obscure New Hampshire company called Dyn, whose servers monitor and reroute internet traffic. The attack, which swamped Dyn's servers with more traffic than they could handle, lasted for about a day, causing widespread disruption to websites throughout the United States. But at least it wasn't caused by a typo. More tech news. Intel buys Mobileye. The $15.3 billion deal speaks volumes about Intel's determination to make sure it can provide the computing power needed for autonomous vehicles. Waymo asks court to block Uber's self-driving car project. Waymo, the self-driving car business spun out of Google's parent company, sued Uber last month, accusing it of colluding with a former Google employee to steal crucial parts of Waymo's technology to accelerate its development of autonomous vehicles.

0,2017-03-15," A criminal network made over $12 million stealing flash drives, headphones, ink cartridges and flea collars from big-box stores and selling them on websites like Amazon and eBay, according to an indictment on Wednesday. Twelve people were indicted on 41 counts including conspiracy, enterprise corruption, money laundering and criminal possession of stolen property, in one of the most sprawling retail crime operations ever investigated. ""The ring, we allege, consisted of four theft crews that operated all across the country stealing valuable merchandise from major retailers like Staples, Office Depot and Best Buy,"" Eric T. Schneiderman, the attorney general of New York, said at a news conference in Manhattan on Wednesday. ""This is not shoplifting,"" he added. ""This is organized crime."" This week, investigators said they seized more than $1 million in stolen goods and over $7.7 million from the defendants, some of whom could face sentences of up to 25 years. Richard Rimbaugh, 64, of Manhattan, and George Athanasatos, 62, of Brooklyn, were accused of leading the ring. When investigators entered Mr. Rimbaugh's apartment to arrest him, Mr. Schneiderman said, they found piles of electronics and witnessed firsthand the arrival of a new delivery: five more packages of stolen merchandise. Mr. Rimbaugh, known as The General within the ring, requested specific items and resold them on Amazon and eBay, while Mr. Athanasatos, who was called the Field Marshall, closely managed the crime teams and issued credit cards to cover their travel expenses, according to Mr. Schneiderman. Mr. Athanasatos was also indicted on a separate charge of welfare fraud conspiracy. Mr. Schneiderman, whose Organized Crime Task Force led the investigation with support from state police, stood in front of an array of electronic equipment in unopened — if slightly battered — packages. Behind him was a map of the United States that he said was removed from Mr. Athanasatos' apartment. The map had colored stickpins that investigators said represented targeted stores. Those stickpins were not only clustered along the eastern corridor; they were scattered as far north as Minnesota, as far South as Texas, and as far West as California. The sprawling operation covered 28 states and was ""extremely sophisticated and complicated,"" Mr. Schneiderman said. But the thefts themselves were decidedly low-tech. The lower-level operatives, the authorities said, walked into big-box stores with tailor-made denim vests full of hidden pockets. They used shortwave radios to listen in on security workers, and carried bulky electronic devices to deactivate security alarms. The ten-month investigation, ""Operation Sticky Fingers,"" used surveillance, wiretaps, security camera footage and financial records analysis. It gave the authorities ""the best glimpse perhaps we've seen in a very long time into how massive nationwide multi-million-dollar retail theft rings operate,"" Mr. Schneiderman said. New York police superintendent George P. Beach said in a statement that the operation victimized ""both retailers and the public,"" and commended the work of the state police's Special Investigation Unit. The National Retail Foundation reported last year that organized retail crime is on the rise, and costs the industry $30 billion annually."
0,2017-03-16," Season 4 of the thrilling sci-fi series ""Orphan Black"" arrives on Amazon. And Logo airs back-to-back ""Sister Act"" movies, for five hours of Whoopi Goldberg's convent antics and musical comedy.  ORPHAN BLACK on Amazon. The fourth season of this BBC America series about dubious science and self-aware clones — all portrayed with acrobatic, Emmy-winning acting by Tatiana Maslany — has arrived on streaming platforms for your bingeing pleasure. CORALINE (2009) on Netflix. Neil Gaiman's 2002 children's novella ""Coraline,"" the inspiration for this movie, is slim and fast-paced. A. O. Scott, writing in The New York Times, called Henry Selick's adaptation, with 3-D stop-motion animation, ""exquisitely realized."" Mr. Selick made a film that is ""certainly exciting,"" Mr. Scott wrote. ""But rather than race through ever noisier set pieces toward a hectic climax in the manner of so much animation aimed at kids,"" he continued, ""'Coraline' lingers in an atmosphere that is creepy, wonderfully strange and full of feeling."" SISTER ACT (1992) 5:30 p.m. on Logo. A Reno lounge singer hiding from a mob boss in a conservative convent — what could go wrong? Whoopi Goldberg stars in this ultimately big-hearted comedy, which features musical arrangements by Marc Shaiman (""Hairspray"") and script doctoring by the sorely missed Carrie Fisher. ""The main lesson of 'Sister Act,'"" Janet Maslin wrote in a largely negative review in The Times, ""is that many girl-group hits of the 1960s were even more divine than many of us originally realized."" The film, however, was enough of a commercial success to warrant a sequel: ""Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit"" (1993), which follows at 8:05. Original cast members — like Kathy Najimy, and Maggie Smith as the convent's Mother Superior — return, and newcomers include Lauryn Hill. GREY'S ANATOMY 8 p.m. on ABC. ShondaLand's Thursday night programming begins with this flagship drama, in which April and Jackson travel to Montana to perform surgery. On ""Scandal,"" at 9, Rowan is surprised by someone from his past, while Olivia has an important campaign decision to make. At 10, ""The Catch"" continues its sophomore season as the team members face off with an assassin hunting their new client. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (2007) 8 p.m. on Showtime 2. This Coen brothers adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's noir novel, which won four Oscars including best picture, is widely regarded as filmmaking at its finest. Its villain, played by Javier Bardem, is ""a figure of evil so calm, so extreme, so implacable that to hear his voice is to feel the temperature in the theater drop,"" A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. But that chill, he added, is also a good sign. ""'No Country for Old Men' is purgatory for the squeamish and the easily spooked,"" he wrote. ""For formalists — those moviegoers sent into raptures by tight editing, nimble camera work and faultless sound design — it's pure heaven."""
0,2017-03-17," Since 2013, Amazon has released a batch of original TV pilots several times a year. Some of them will become full-fledged series, some not. Our TV critics look at the latest crop.  Michel Faber's spiritual 2014 sci-fi novel, ""The Book of Strange New Things,"" did not seem like the kind of tale that could be adapted to series television. Having seen the pilot based on it, I'm still not sure it can be. But ""Oasis"" looks pretty while trying. Peter Lee (Richard Madden, Robb Stark on ""Game of Thrones""), a clergyman on a dying Earth, is recruited to minister on a distant planet intended to become a life raft for the wealthy. Why the space base needs a chaplain is a mystery, as are the hallucinations afflicting the crew working in this lifeless (or is it?) but stunning landscape. The moody, haunting first hour — more ""Solaris"" than ""Star Wars"" — only hints at the direction of the series, and its ending suggests a risky change in the novel's premise. The idea of a space saga about faith is compelling. But seeing whether the atmosphere of ""Oasis"" can sustain a story will require a hyperspace leap of faith. JAMES PONIEWOZIK ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" hails from the ""Gilmore Girls"" creator Amy Sherman-Palladino, and it shares some of that show's rhythms and mannerisms. Quick and clever dialogue, yes, and also a main character who's quite taken by her own impish brassiness. Rachel Brosnahan (""House of Cards"") stars as Miriam Maisel, a.k.a. Midge, living her nice-Jewish-girl Upper West Side dream in 1958. After her aspiring-stand-up husband turns out to be a dud both onstage and off, Midge discovers she's actually the one with the comedy chops. The show operates at maximum archness, and while the period setting never feels truly real, the moments of emotional authenticity that do break through shine beautifully and brightly. MARGARET LYONS It's hard to be raunchier than some of the stuff on Adult Swim, but ""The New V.I.P.'s"" manages it. Plenty of animated shows in the ribald genre talk about genitals; not many will show a cartoon penis. The series, from Steve Dildarian (""The Life & Times of Tim""), is a demented workplace comedy in which underlings at a vaguely defined company hatch a scheme to seize control when the boss keels over in the executive washroom. The plan involves body disposal, cosmetic surgery and Ray Liotta. It's funny stuff if you have a high tolerance for crudeness. NEIL GENZLINGER Terry Zwigoff's first completed project since ""Art School Confidential"" in 2006 is a half-hour hit of a particularly potent strain of nostalgia. Adapting T. C. Boyle's 1984 novel, ""Budding Prospects: A Pastoral,"" Mr. Zwigoff (who directed the pilot and wrote it with his wife, Melissa Axelrod) recreates with loving care the mid-80s, pre-internet Mission District of San Francisco, just beginning its long trip from shabby to chic to overrun. If ""Budding Prospects"" gets picked up to series, future episodes would take place in the Mendocino hills, where three city slackers (Joel David Moore, Adam Rose and Will Sasso) agree to spend the summer growing marijuana for a smarmy lawyer (Brett Gelman). Would that scenario keep Mr. Zwigoff interested? It would seem to have ""Bad Santa"" possibilities. In the meantime, the pilot, on its own, is a slight but charming Bay Area miniature that should appeal to fans of ""Crumb."" MIKE HALE The sad-clown trend continues with ""The Legend of Master Legend,"" a glum comedy — or maybe it's an idiosyncratic tragedy? — about a man who is a superhero in his own mind. Master Legend (John Hawkes) roams Las Vegas in a homemade silver-and-black get-up that's a cross between a suit of armor and a professional wrestler's costume. He rights wrongs and secures justice, or at least that's his intent; he causes more problems than he solves. The show is based on a Rolling Stone article about the real-life phenomenon of self-appointed superheroes, a disquieting subject that makes for an off-putting show. NEIL GENZLINGER"

And ABC presents ""Truth and Lies: The Family Manson,"" a two-hour documentary about Charles Manson and the murders by cult members in 1969.  EVERYBODY WANTS SOME!! (2016) on Amazon. Richard Linklater has said this college campus comedy, set in the 1980s, is a spiritual sequel to ""Dazed and Confused,"" his beloved movie about high school life in the '70s. Expect more youthful antics — but also a little bit more. At one point, a professor writes on the board: ""Frontiers are where you find them."" ""I'm not sure where else they are supposed to be,"" A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, but since this is a Linklater film, ""there's no harm in accepting an invitation to some casual philosophizing."" He added: ""That's what the characters in his movies tend to do, even the ballplayers in this one. And though their days are spent in pursuit of sex, beer and other delights, the movie does have an undertow of profundity."" MISS SLOANE (2016) on iTunes. Jessica Chastain stars as Elizabeth, a Washington lobbyist who terrifies with her cunning and chilly appearance, which The Times's Stephen Holden called ""one step away from a bloodless cousin of Morticia Addams."" Still, she has principles and refuses to work for a thinly fictionalized National Rifle Association, and drama ensues. ""Partly because 'Miss Sloane' is more a character study than a coherent political drama, it fumbles the issue it purports to address, and it eventually runs aground in a preposterous ending,"" Mr. Holden wrote. ""In light of the recent presidential election, it all feels like small potatoes."" THE BEATLES: EIGHT DAYS A WEEK (2016) on iTunes. Ron Howard's documentary about the Beatles' meteoric rise to fame in the 1960s is difficult to get through without smiling, Neil Genzlinger wrote in The Times. ""That, at least, is likely to be your reaction if you were alive during Beatlemania,"" he added. Trickier is whether the film will interest "" millennials and whatever other generations weren't yet born when John, Paul, George and Ringo took the world by storm."" FARGO on Hulu. Season 2 of this anthology crime drama, with touches of dark comedy, is available and ripe for binge watching. Its stars include Kirsten Dunst, Patrick Wilson and Ted Danson in a 10-episode story arc about a young couple (Ms. Dunst and Jesse Plemons) who try to cover up a hit-and-run death while two law enforcement officials (Mr. Wilson and Mr. Danson) investigate murders that may be related.

But Bosley Crowther, who reviewed ""Psycho"" in The New York Times, was not impressed when the film opened. He wrote that the movie had ""slow buildups to sudden shocks that are old-fashioned melodramatics, however effective and sure, until a couple of people have been gruesomely punctured and the mystery of the haunted house has been revealed."" He continued: ""Then it may be a matter of question whether Mr. Hitchcock's points of psychology, the sort highly favored by Krafft-Ebing, are as reliable as his melodramatic stunts. Frankly, we feel his explanations are a bit of leg-pulling by a man who has been known to resort to such tactics in his former films."" BABY MAMA (2008) 8 p.m. on HBO. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler starred in this comedy about a 37-year-old single woman (Ms. Fey) who hires a silly, slap-happy surrogate (Ms. Poehler) to help her have the child she desperately wants. ""The film never comes fully to term, as it were: the visual style is sitcom functional, and even the zippiest jokes fall flat because of poor timing,"" Manohla Dargis wrote in The Times.

1,2017-03-20," ALTER DO CHÃO, Brazil — Even though it is far removed from the sea in a remote corner of the Amazon jungle, Alter do Chão must rank among the world's most alluring beach towns. White-sand beaches along the Tapajós River beckon visitors who drive from as far as Cuiabá, a landlocked city nearly 1,000 miles to the south. The clear, warm waters lure snorkelers and practitioners of standup paddle boarding. Just want to chill? Sit in a cafe, sip an ice-cold bottle of Tijuca beer and gaze at the sun setting over forest-shrouded ridges teeming with wildlife like sloths and howler monkeys. While on a reporting trip this year in the Amazon Basin, I escaped to Alter do Chão for a few days after hearing tales of its rugged beauty. In a country with more than 4,600 miles of coastline, I wondered if one of Brazil's best beaches could really be situated deep in the untamed interior of the world's largest rain forest. ""If you want to experience the real Alter, you'll have to eat the ants,"" Pitó, 55, a Cumaruara Indian who guides visitors on treks through the jungle, explained to me. He plucked a saúva ant out of the jungle floor and dared me to eat it. Crunchy like popcorn, it was delicious, with hints of lemongrass. I couldn't have asked for a better guide than Pitó, whose full name is Raimundo Gilmar Faria da Costa. In the space of a few hours, he showed me how to hunt with a bow, navigate a canoe, fish with a harpoon, tap a rubber tree — even speak a few words of Nheengatú, the indigenous lingua franca that has persisted for centuries around the Amazon. ""I'll bet you don't get this stuff in Ipanema,"" Pitó said, joking about the legendary beach in Rio de Janeiro, the coastal city where I've lived for six years. Of course, Pitó was right. For a singular Brazilian beach experience, one must travel all the way to Alter, which feels like a slow-paced oasis of tranquillity in a country on edge over a protracted economic crisis, colossal corruption scandals and rising political polarization. Alter wasn't always viewed as a rain forest beach town. Pedro Teixeira, a Portuguese explorer who led expeditions into the Amazon with the aim of enslaving indigenous peoples, established a colonial outpost here in 1626. But for centuries, Alter remained a backwater, save for luring residents from the nearby city of Santarém and the occasional adventurer. The British naturalist Henry Walter Bates made it here in the 1850s, calling Alter ""a neglected, poverty-stricken place."" ""The houses in the village swarmed with vermin; bats in the thatch; fire ants (formiga de fogo) under the floors; cockroaches and spiders on the walls,"" he wrote. Despite such misgivings, this place grew on Bates, who would let his mind wander on Alter's beaches after conducting research in the surrounding forest into animal mimicry that supported Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. ""The soft pale light,"" Bates wrote in ""The Naturalist on the River Amazons,"" ""resting on broad sandy beaches and palm-thatched huts, reproduced the effect of a midwinter scene in the cold north when a coating of snow lies on the landscape."" Winter wasn't the first thing that popped into my mind when I explored sun-drenched Alter on foot. In the heat, people wore the same beach fashions, from bikinis to boardshorts, that prevailed in Rio. The leafy plaza had a mellow vibe with vendors offering bowls of the deep-purple açaí fruit sprinkled with tapioca. In cafes, visitors savored plates of Amazonian fish like pirarucu and tucunaré. ""This place is peaceful and magical, unlike where we came from,"" said Alexis Álvarez, 29, a tattoo artist from Venezuela who moved here recently with his wife, a schoolteacher, and their 1-year-old daughter, seeking refuge in Brazil after enduring scarcities of food and medicine during Venezuela's economic upheaval. ""We feel at home in Alter,"" said Mr. Álvarez, explaining that he and his wife were supporting themselves by selling the jewelry they make. ""I think we're here to stay."" The writer and explorer Alex Shoumatoff was enthralled with Alter when he visited in 1977, describing it as ""the first place I would head for when I finally gave up trying to fit into the modern world."" But things change fast in the Amazon. With the completion of a highway cutting across the river basin, Mr. Shoumatoff returned in 1984 and found Alter unrecognizable, with teenagers ""drinking Coke, water-skiing, bombing around in open Jeeps with roll bars, moonwalking to Michael Jackson tapes."" Alter still swells with rowdy visitors from Santarém on weekends. Some in the town complain about rising tension between locals and outsiders. I heard warnings about hiking on a path overlooking Alter's beaches, after the brutal murders a few years ago of two people on the route. ""The day I arrived here I felt some very special energy, and I wasn't able to leave,"" said Marcelo Freitas Gananca, 49, who moved to Alter in 1998 from São Paulo. He owns Araribá, a store selling an astonishing collection of indigenous folk art, including ceremonial masks, war clubs, drums and 20-foot-long blow guns. ""But now the town is at a critical turning point where it could go in one direction or another,"" Mr. Gananca said, citing challenges like the lack of a sewage system, tensions with newcomers and the construction of garish new lodgings that reflect little of Alter's origins. In the face of such tests, I wondered what Alter would look like a few years from now. Along with the grumbling about so-called soybean barons from neighboring Mato Grosso State building villas here, some in Alter also insisted that they could forge a balance between tourism and sustainability. ""Maybe Alter is a meeting point where we can learn from each other,"" said Pitó, the Cumaruara guide. ""Doesn't the world need a place where people can slow down, put their hand in the water and feel the river's flow?"""
0,2017-03-23," Amazon, the $400 billion online retailer, is purchasing, cheaply, a curious trinket. The Seattle-based company is paying less than $1 billion for Souq.com, a Middle Eastern e-commerce upstart. Amazon gets a low-cost toehold in a region that is hard to conquer. That said, overseas buyers have a history of regretting purchases of shiny objects in this labyrinthine market. Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, has always focused on long-term potential. That's a description that matches the Middle East. The region's population is expanding, mobile devices are omnipresent, and there are pockets of huge wealth — yet e-commerce is underdeveloped. Picking winners is not easy, however. Yahoo paid over $160 million in 2009 for the portal Maktoob, and later shut down essentially all operations in the Middle East. Yahoo also did not acquire what may have been the best parts of Maktoob — one excluded property being Souq.com. The region's many legal and economic jurisdictions, and a tendency to favor red tape and entrenched cartels, make it hard for even powerful newcomers like Uber to break in. At least anecdotally, delivery can also be unreliable in many countries. Souq has raised $425 million in funding since it was founded in 2005, according to CrunchBase; the last round valued it at around $1 billion. The sale to Amazon, at $650 million to $750 million, according to The Financial Times, shows how investor optimism can be checked by reality. But Mr. Bezos is not afraid of complex endeavors. E-commerce remains a tough business, getting payments and tax levies right can be convoluted, and no company has found a simple solution to the problem of delivering packages to all the people who want them. The extreme conditions of Souq's territory may mean the purchase will never really make financial sense. On the other hand, the outlay is pocket change for Amazon and could prove a useful testing ground for its global ambitions."
0,2017-03-25," SEATTLE — Last Sunday in Palm Springs, Calif., Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, climbed into the cockpit of a 13-foot robot and began flailing his arms as though warming up for a workout, causing the robot's enormous appendages to mimic his movements. ""Why do I feel so much like Sigourney Weaver?"" Mr. Bezos said, referring to the actress who wore a mechanical suit in a climactic battle in the 1986 movie ""Aliens."" The intimate audience of entrepreneurs and academics, attending an Amazon conference on robotics and artificial intelligence, chuckled. Later, Mr. Bezos posted a photo on Twitter of himself in the suit with a more menacing air, the robot's arms raised as if about to deliver a bone-crushing bear hug. For years, retailers have been haunted by the thought of Amazon using its technological prowess to squeeze them into powder. That battle has mostly played out on Amazon's home turf, the world of online shopping. Now the fight is coming directly to retailers on actual streets around the globe, where Amazon is slowly building a fleet of physical stores. And while most of the attention has been focused on Amazon's grocery store dreams, the company has a more ambitious collection of experiments underway. If those experiments work — and there is no guarantee of that — they could have a profound influence on how other stores operate. Over time, they could also introduce new forms of automation, putting traditional retail jobs in jeopardy. At the same time, locating those stores close to customers' homes could also help Amazon further its ambitions of delivering internet orders within hours. The company is exploring the idea of creating stores to sell furniture and home appliances, like refrigerators — the kinds of products that shoppers are reluctant to buy over the internet sight unseen, said one of several people with knowledge of the discussions who, in conversations with The New York Times, spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans were confidential. The stores would serve as showcases where people could view the items in person, with orders being delivered to their homes. These would not be your average Home Depots: Amazon has considered using forms of augmented or virtual reality to allow people to see how couches, stoves and credenzas will look in their homes, the person briefed on the discussions said. Amazon is also kicking around an electronics-store concept similar to Apple's retail emporiums, according to two of the people familiar with the discussions. These shops would have a heavy emphasis on Amazon devices and services such as the company's Echo smart home speaker and Prime Video streaming service. And in groceries — a giant category in which Amazon has struggled — the company has opened a convenience store that does not need cashiers, and it is close to opening two stores where drivers can quickly pick up groceries without leaving their cars, all in Seattle. It has explored another grocery store concept that could serve walk-in customers and act as a hub for home deliveries. Overseas, Amazon is quietly targeting India for new brick-and-mortar grocery stores. It is a vast market, and one still largely dominated by traditional street bazaars where shoppers must wander from stall to stall haggling over prices and deliberating over unrefrigerated meat sitting in the dusty open air. Amazon's internal code name for its India grocery ambitions: Project Everest. Last week, Amazon opened its fifth physical book store in Chicago, and it has five more announced locations under construction. It is possible that some of the store ideas will never see the light of day. Groups within Amazon are often encouraged to come up with zany initiatives (this is the company that popularized the idea of drone deliveries). Many ideas are chucked after deeper scrutiny by executives. Amazon declined to talk about any stores it has not announced publicly. ""We are always thinking about new ways to serve customers, but thinking is different than planning,"" said Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman. Since the late '90s, pundits have asked when Amazon — the company Mr. Bezos founded on the premise that people would rather shop from the comfort of their screens — would finally start building stores. But Amazon executives saw plenty of opportunities in online retail and new ways to reach people, from creating digital book-selling devices like Kindle to building up the Prime membership service for getting faster deliveries and other benefits. In 2012, Mr. Bezos told the television interviewer Charlie Rose that shoppers were already well served by existing retailers and that Amazon had no interest in a me-too effort. ""We want to do something uniquely Amazon,"" he said. ""If we can find that idea, and we haven't found it yet, but if we can find that idea, we would love to open physical stores."" Despite Amazon's internet retailing success, over time it has become clear that there is a lot of shopping that people prefer to do in person. The most glaring example is groceries — the mother of all shopping categories, with about $770 billion for the supermarkets represented by the Food Marketing Institute, a nonprofit group that includes the majority of such stores in the United States. After pouring resources into an online grocery service, AmazonFresh, for almost a decade, the company has made only modest progress. According to people familiar with the workings of the company's grocery business, it has struggled to operate it profitably, leading to a slow rollout of the service in new locations. One big desire many customers have is that they want to see fresh fruits, vegetables and meat in person before buying them. The relatively high cost of home delivery — Amazon charges $15 a month for its Fresh service, on top of a $99 annual Prime membership — is another barrier. Online grocery delivery accounts for only about 3 percent of the market in the United States, though it is closer to 10 percent in Britain, said Randy Burt, a partner in the food and beverage practice of A. T. Kearney, a strategy and management consulting firm. Mr. Burt said Amazon's growing interest in stores mirrored the conclusion that other online merchants with physical stores — the apparel seller Bonobos and the eyewear seller Warby Parker — had come to. ""I think they are recognizing, for certain things you can't digitize and replicate online all the experience one has in a store,"" Mr. Burt said. ""The ability to create experiences is going to be critical for them to continue to get share."" Joe Thompson, a former general manager in Amazon's retail business, sees physical retail as key to Mr. Bezos's outsize ambitions for the company. ""I can't help but feel that, in Bezos's mind, he wants to be the first trillion-dollar valuation company,"" said Mr. Thompson, who is now an executive at BuildDirect, an online home improvement store. To do that, he said, Amazon would have to ""crack"" a couple of ""completely underpenetrated markets online."" Amazon's current market value is bobbing around $400 billion. In the coming weeks, Amazon is expected to open its first two grocery pickup stores, in Seattle's Ballard and SoDo neighborhoods, which will allow customers to order food online and schedule brief windows for picking them up in person. Recently, as cars ripped by, workers hung a sign on the exterior of one of the stores — to be called AmazonFresh Pickup, according to city permit documents obtained by GeekWire — before quickly covering it up. A growing number of established grocery retailers are experimenting with this ""click and collect"" approach to shopping, including Walmart, Kroger and others. According to one person briefed on Amazon's plans, the company has been developing technology for automatically detecting when a customer pulls into the parking lot so orders can be brought to them more quickly. A few miles away from its other Seattle stores, on the ground floor of one of its many office towers in the city, the company is testing Amazon Go, a convenience store concept stocked with beverages, sandwiches and prepared meals, which are put together by chefs in a kitchen that is visible from the street. The retail industry has been captivated by Amazon Go's technology since the company unveiled the store late last year. The store uses a combination of sensors and artificial intelligence to automatically detect the food items shoppers remove from shelves, so they can leave the store without visiting a cashier — the way customers do when they bolt from an Uber. ""Amazon is wonderful at frictionless commerce,"" said Timothy Laseter, a professor at the University of Virginia's Darden School of Business. There have been glitches with the technology that Amazon engineers continue to work on, according to a person familiar with the operations. For now, only Amazon employees are allowed to use the store. Amazon previously said it would open Amazon Go to the public in early 2017. If Amazon is successful at automating the checkout process, the long-term implications for employment could be far-reaching because other retailers would probably do everything possible to copy it. More than 3.4 million people are employed as cashiers in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Amazon Go technologies like artificial intelligence are ""Latin for 'fire cashiers,'"" said Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University's Leonard N. Stern School of Business. ""I've probably been in 30 boardrooms of retailers in the past year,"" Mr. Galloway said. ""I would say the No. 1 topic of conversation is Amazon."" For months, reports have circulated that Amazon was considering a concept for a larger grocery store that would combine shopping formats like traditional walk-in purchases, click-and-collect and home delivery. One of those articles, a February piece by The New York Post, described a futuristic Amazon grocery store staffed by robots, requiring only three human workers. That was too much, apparently, for Mr. Bezos, who became uncharacteristically feisty on Twitter, attacking the article by saying The Post's sources had ""mixed up their meds."" But a group within Amazon has explored another larger grocery store format, according to both a person familiar with the concept and to internal Amazon documents reviewed by The New York Times. The store could stock fresh produce, meats and other items in a public area of the store, while keeping frozen foods, cereals and other items traditionally found in the center of a grocery store behind a wall, in what would be a kind of small Amazon warehouse. Workers behind the wall, not robots, could quickly package orders for customers. The idea resembles a concept laid out in a paper, ""A Beautiful Way to Save Woolworths,"" written by the retail industry consultant Brittain Ladd, who was later hired by Amazon. The status of that project at Amazon is unclear: One person said it never advanced far and was effectively dead, and another disputed that characterization. While Mr. Bezos was known for coining the motto ""Get Big Fast"" in the early days of Amazon, the company's plans in physical retail could be better described as ""Get Big Slow."" Some reports have said Amazon has discussed building up to 2,000 grocery stores. But that figure was floated mainly as a hypothetical to consider the impact on Amazon's supply chain, not as a goal that was under serious consideration, a person familiar with the discussions said. In addition to the two soon to open in Seattle, as many as five more AmazonFresh Pickup locations could open by next year, and the company hopes to expand Amazon Go to Britain and several cities in the United States in the same time frame, this person said. India could represent another big market for Amazon in physical retail. The company, which has vowed to spend billions of dollars on its efforts in the world's second-most populous country, recently sought approval from the Indian government to open online and physical food stores in the country, The Economic Times reported in February. According to a person familiar with Amazon's India grocery efforts, the company hopes to open its first Indian grocery store in Bangalore. In a statement, Amazon said the company was excited by the Indian government's efforts to encourage foreign investment in a ""stronger food supply chain."" ""We have sought an approval to invest and partner with the government in achieving this vision,"" Amazon said. For Mr. Galloway at N.Y.U., the slow pace of Amazon's rollout of stores is a sign that it has not figured out physical retail yet, and that has surprised him. Five years ago, he believed Amazon would have hundreds of stores by this time. ""What appears to be clear is they haven't yet zeroed in on a format they're willing to massively scale,"" he said. ""This is a company that the moment it figures out something that works, it puts nuclear energy behind it."""
0,2017-03-27," Barry Jenkins, the writer and director of ""Moonlight,"" named best picture at last month's Academy Awards, is teaming again with that film's producers for a new television series for Amazon. ""The Underground Railroad"" will be an adaptation of the acclaimed Colson Whitehead novel of the same title, winner of the 2016 National Book Award for fiction. As with ""Moonlight,"" adapted from an original script by the playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney, Mr. Jenkins will write and direct the limited series, which will be executive produced by Pastel, a company co-founded by Mr. Jenkins, and Brad Pitt's Plan B Entertainment. The project has been in the works for months but Amazon announced on Monday that it had signed on to develop the series. ""Preserving the sweep and grandeur of a story like this requires bold, innovative thinking,"" Mr. Jenkins said in a statement. ""In Amazon we've found a partner whose reverence for storytelling and freeness of form is wholly in line with our vision."" Mr. Whitehead's novel combines historical sweep with surreal details, tracking a young slave who escapes from bondage via an actual railroad. It was a best seller and was one of the most celebrated books of 2016. The underground railroad already figures in one series: ""Underground,"" a generally well-received drama for WGN America that began its second season this month. It is unclear when ""The Underground Railroad"" would debut on Amazon or how many episodes it would include. The series has not officially been given the green light, though the high-profile nature of the title and figures involved make that seem likely. If it is approved, the show would skip Amazon's usual pilot process and go straight to series."
0,2017-03-30," As someone old enough to remember the ""Stop Pay TV!"" campaigns that movie theaters and affiliated parties mounted in the late 1960s — ""Don't let Pay TV be the monster in your living room,"" blared one such ad — I am occasionally amused that paying for televised entertainment is now pretty much a fact of life. As multidevice streaming rapidly evolves into something like the norm, the concept of cord-cutting has started becoming a reality for some viewers. It's difficult to find reliable data on how many households have given up cable TV and now get all their television via a streaming add-on like Roku, Amazon Fire or Google Chromecast. I know two couples who have done this. One of them had a viewing party on election night last November and hoo, boy, things got interesting when a Wi-Fi glitch occurred around 10 p.m. Eastern time. (One thing you should make sure you have before any kind of cable cord-cutting is reliable high-speed internet, without which there's no streaming.) In any event, it appears that the situation for many consumers involves keeping cable and shuffling various streaming services. So in addition to all the other monthly bills, we are also, in this scenario, forced to keep up with individual fees for streaming services. Bundling is part of why people opt for cable in the first place, and it's becoming a feature of certain streaming services; Amazon Video is one of several that lets you piggyback various other services, usually at a slightly reduced fee. ""Watching TV is more complicated than ever,"" a pitchman on a broadcast ad for TV Guide announced in the 1980s. Wherever that fellow is now, I bet he's terribly confused. With all this in mind, I've assembled three discrete monthly streaming ""packages"" for dedicated movie watchers to consider. It's worth remembering that almost all of the services come with one-month free trials. And with some notable exceptions, almost all the services offer more than just movies. PACKAGE 1: 'THE MAINSTREAMER' Its foundational pillars are Amazon Video ($8.99) and Netflix ($9.99). (For the sake of coherence, I'm going to stick to monthly rates, before taxes; note that Amazon's video service comes with Amazon Prime's $99 annual fee.) Hulu carries more television shows than movies, but it's not light on movies, particularly popular ones. Unless you like to watch commercials, in which case your Hulu will run $7.99, the desirable option will be commercial-free version at $11.99. Add HBO Now ($14.99), Starz ($8.99) and Showtime ($10.99). That's $65.94 worth of monthly streaming. (Explorers of Amazon Video/Amazon Prime will point out that there's a good deal of HBO programming already free through the service; this doesn't include movies currently on HBO, or the most recent original programming, including made-for-the-channel movies. This is worth considering when determining whether or not to add HBO Now.) But if you want to rent or purchase a film on demand, either a classic or something recently released in theaters, there are also movies available à la carte, from $2.99 to $14.99, available on Amazon, Vudu, Google Play, iTunes and more. Let's postulate that each month you spend $2.99, $4.99 and $14.99 on a single movie from one of these — that's $22.97. So the services and a few potentially spur-of-the-moment purchases, you're looking at $88.91. Not exactly cheap, but were I to pitch it to you with the proviso ""Less Than $100 a Month,"" you might think, ""Not bad."" PACKAGE 2: 'THE BUFF' These are movie-only or movie-heavy sites that offer cinema of a more artistic, esoteric, possibly obscure bent, and reject American cultural hegemony by, in most cases, going around the world for their fare. I'd say the foundation would be FilmStruck with the Criterion Channel option at $10.99 a month. It's $6.99 a month without Criterion, but you'll want Criterion, for its smartly chosen array of largely foreign cinematic milestones. Warner Archive ($9.99) is the odds and ends of a great American studio, not a very global concern but still full of enticing options. Then there's the limited-run streaming art house Mubi ($5.99), which has, during special promotions, offered enticing yearly subscription discounts ($34.99 as opposed to $47.99). Fandor, an eclectic and often exciting service with thousands of movies ranging from martial arts romps such as ""Master of the Flying Guillotine"" to expansive, obscure French brainteasers like ""Out 1,"" is $10 a month. And the solid indie provider Sundance Now, which also offers original series, is $6.99. That's about $44 a month. PACKAGE 3: 'THE FRINGE' If you like genre movies above all, or like digging for cinematic thrills in obscure but not necessarily arty corners, this might be a good option. You'll need Warner Archive ($9.99); the blaxploitation service Brown Sugar ($3.99); and the horror specialist Screamhouse ($4.99), which runs scary gamuts each with its own menu subheading, including ""Extreme,"" which has the indeed highly unpleasant ""Cannibal Ferox."" Shudder, another horror service ($4.99), recently made waves by offering the controversial Ken Russell nuns-gone-wild film ""The Devils""; finicky horror lovers almost immediately protested on social media that it was not the uncut version. (In fairness to Shudder, the actual provenance of an uncut version of this movie is highly obscure.) Amazon's video service is rife with noir titles in various states of disrepair or restoration. A lot of genre stuff in the public domain (until a copyright owner can effectively yell ""Foul!"") is on YouTube, which is free; for the sake of argument, we'll add YouTubeRed ($9.99) to this bill of fare. Crunchyroll has an anime-only membership for $6.95. And the Urban Movie Channel ($4.99) is not as blaxploitation-heavy as Brown Sugar, but it doesn't exactly lack, either, especially when it comes to latter-day genre variants like the Southern sins-of-the-fathers 2009 thriller ""In the Electric Mist"" or the bayou-psychic tale ""The Sickle"" (2015). Total: a little over $45; with Amazon added as a digging option, a little under $55. All this of course can be supplemented by free services other than YouTube, like the site of DVD label Shout! Factory and Vimeo. If only there was a service that would allow one to buy leisure time, we'd be all set."

1,2017-03-31," Ice-T claims that original copies of the album featuring ""Cop Killer"" are so rare, even he doesn't have one. ""The only way you can get it now is on YouTube,"" he said. ""They're on Amazon, and they're pretty expensive, too."" (Interested collectors would be advised to check out eBay.) Nearly 25 years ago, Ice-T (the hip-hop star born Tracy Marrow) and Body Count put out that deliberately over-the-top thrash-metal response to police brutality, prompting outrage from President George H.W. Bush and police groups everywhere. The heat became too much for even an outspoken West Coast gangster-rap pioneer — ""the vice president was on my bumper,"" he said — and he agreed to pull the song from new copies of the album. Body Count, which releases its sixth album, ""Bloodlust,"" on Friday, formed when Ice-T's Crenshaw High School friend Ernie C needed an outlet to play impossibly fast guitar. Then well known for vivid street-fighting hip-hop songs like ""Colors"" and ""Lethal Weapon,"" Ice-T introduced the band to crowds on the 1991 Lollapalooza tour. Now 59, he has gone on to portray one of television's longest-running police characters, Detective Fin Tutuola of ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,"" a point that this ""Cop Killer"" singer notes with a rumbling laugh. On its first album since the 2014 LP ""Manslaughter,"" Body Count remains heavy and uncompromising, threatening horror-movie violence on ""The Ski Mask Way"" and pausing for political commentary on ""No Lives Matter."" By phone from his Edgewater, N.J., home, where his 1-year-old daughter was cooing in the background, Ice-T cheerfully reeled off expletives abundantly enough to complicate the editing of these excerpts from the conversation.  Why was it important to include a discussion and defense of Black Lives Matter on the album?  Because I just felt people were really confused. ""You think black people, when they say Black Lives Matter, that's a statement of power. That's a statement of despair."" It's like, come on, man, stop killing us. One of my jobs in music is to try to explain stuff — ""Ice, break it down."" I tried to break it down in a way that you understood: We as black people are just trying to be treated as human beings, and our lives are valuable. Body Count has evolved from shocking to philosophical. On this album, you say, ""The ability to kill is innate as our ability to love."" Why? I'm an older guy now, and I see things. Your perspective is different. The early Body Count, I was much more angry, but I didn't know why. Now I'm trying to explain it. One guy told me the other day: ""Ice, you're very lucky, because you've been able to see it from the poor man and the better-off man, and that's a view very few people get to see."" Also, let's be real, when I came out, there was no internet. You could shock people easy. There was no Eminem. Last September, you said of Donald J. Trump, then a presidential candidate: ""I'm kinda scared of that dude."" Still feel that way? I think everybody does. He's a little too hotheaded to have that much power. When you're basically running the biggest army, [for] the most powerful country on earth, you don't have to be all excited and amped; you can't get aggravated like that. Obama was catching Osama bin Laden [while he was] out to dinner, giving people daps. Low-key. That's how presidents react. You don't get at mad at Nordstrom. Like, come on, son. N.W.A made ""Straight Outta Compton,"" but you did West Coast gangster rap first. Do you ever think, ""Where's my biopic?"" Nah, nah, nah, nah, absolutely not. People were asking, ""Was I out first?,"" and [Ice] Cube and them will tell you. Everybody knows. We used to tour together. I'm just glad the homies got their stories told. I have no desire to do a biopic. What if you do a biopic, and nobody comes to see it? Dear God. I'm good. That's too risky for me. How quickly did you say yes to the insurance commercial in which you are sitting with adorable kids at a lemonade stand? Once I read it, I thought it was funny. I always try to let people know that the guy on the record is me, but also the guy sitting at home with his kid is me, the guy on ""SVU."" I'm all those people. I'm not a one-dimensional person. People look at me like, ""Oh, wow, I heard your album, I figure you live in a house full of meat hooks, with people hanging."" No, no, no, no, no. The only bad part about it is, I walk around now, people yell, ""Hey, lemonade!"""
0,2017-04-05," The supermarket shelves are nearly bare. The government in Oslo has turned its back. And the caverns holding the prehistoric treasure that transformed an Arctic outpost devoid of crime and death into a violence-filled petri dish have been buried under 300,000 tons of snow and ice. Season 2 of ""Fortitude,"" the British thriller previously shown on Pivot in the United States, opens with a rare heavenly spectacle called a blood aurora, a decapitation and a move to Amazon Prime starting Friday, April 14. Picking up nine weeks after the first installment's wasp-filled cataclysm, the series finds Sheriff Dan Anderssen (Richard Dormer) vanished into the glacial wilderness after shooting the woman (Verónica Echegui) he loved. It also introduces Dennis Quaid into the cast as Michael Lennox, a genial fisherman intent on doing whatever it takes to find a cure for his terminally ill wife (Michelle Fairley) — and more unnameable dread than ever as this town on the Svalbard archipelago in Norway hurtles toward environmental catastrophe."
1,2017-04-05," SEATTLE — Amazon customers will soon be able to watch live football games as part of the retailer's growing online video service. The National Football League has reached an agreement with Amazon to allow Amazon Prime customers to stream 10 ""Thursday Night Football"" games in the coming season, N.F.L. and Amazon representatives said. Prime customers spend $99 a year for a membership that includes free shipping and a video service with a library of movies and TV shows. Amazon agreed to pay about $50 million for the streaming rights to the N.F.L. games, according to a person briefed on the deal who asked for anonymity because the price was confidential. The amount was about five times the roughly $10 million Twitter agreed to pay the N.F.L. last year for streaming rights to ""Thursday Night Football,"" this person said. The agreement represents another step in the delicate dance between tech and entertainment companies as more viewers shift their viewing habits to the internet and digital devices. Amazon and Netflix are pouring money into their video services, both licensing content and producing original programming. Some viewers of these video services are so-called cord cutters, who forgo cable television subscriptions. Sports remain a big reason people keep their cable services. But ratings wobbled last year for many N.F.L. broadcasts, and the league has grown concerned that younger viewers are not watching football in traditional ways. Agreements with Amazon and other internet companies are an attempt by the N.F.L. to reach younger fans, even though the league risks alienating the broadcast networks that pay hundreds of millions of dollars in rights fees. For Amazon, the N.F.L. agreement is an attempt to fill one of the biggest holes in its lineup. Amazon will stream games produced by either CBS or NBC, which air the games on television. The Thursday night games will also air on NFL Network, the league's cable channel. The television audience for ""Thursday Night Football"" dwarfed the internet audience during last season's experiment on Twitter. The average viewership on Twitter at any given minute was 266,000, according to the N.F.L. The figure for television, including broadcast and cable, was 15.8 million. Analysts estimate that as many as 60 million households use Amazon Prime."
0,2017-04-06," When you shop for cat food online, Amazon knows who you are. When you look for the best airfares for summer vacation, Google knows who you are. Soon, when you get behind the wheel, your car may recognize you, too. Using cameras with facial recognition software and other biometric indicators, automakers are looking to personalize the driving experience with cars that stare back at you, quietly adjusting seats and driving modes. They may even anticipate your wants and desires by playing your favorite music based on your mood. And it's not only about convenience, but also about the possibility of improving safety and security. ""It's not just about personalization,"" said Zachary Bolton, a systems and technology engineer at Continental Automotive Group, explaining the sophistication of such systems. ""We can use the gleam, the twinkle in your eye to determine precisely where you're looking."" Engineers can then dynamically adjust the so-called human machine interface, putting critical information, say, about a stalled car up ahead, or the fact that you are about to exceed the speed limit, directly in a driver's line of sight on the dashboard or in a display on the windshield. Conversely, by tracking downward eye movements, the car could ""see"" that a driver was distracted and sound a warning. Continental has already demonstrated in-car systems that allow drivers to register their faces using something as simple as a driver's license picture. An interior infrared camera is used to overcome potential obstacles like sunglasses, which would stymie a conventional video camera. Putting the camera in the center instrument cluster also helps to pinpoint the driver's eyes, even if she's wearing a hat. The biggest technical challenge — glare caused by sunlight — can be filtered out using machine learning, Mr. Bolton said. Once the car knows who you are, systems in vehicles like the Chrysler Portal concept car would automatically adjust the seat for maximum comfort, select a driving mode (for example, one driver likes to let the car do most of the work; another likes taking control in sport mode) and suggest a destination based on the owner's past behavior. Watching a driver's face can also give a car important clues about that person's state of mind. For several years, carmakers like Ford and tech companies like Intel have been interested in determining whether a driver is happy or sad. Depending on your mood, a car could change its tune, playing a bouncy Beach Boys song and changing the interior lighting to improve your attitude. Honda's NeuV concept car, for example, has a large customizable LCD dashboard and a cloud-connected, onboard computer that uses artificial intelligence to interact with drivers. NeuV employs what the company coyly refers to as an ""emotion engine"" to grease the wheels of the conversation, and its automated personal assistant can read ""facial skin vibrations"" to help it isolate the driver's voice and better understand spoken commands. There are practical reasons as well, designers say, for detecting a driver's emotional state: A calm driver is a safer driver. So cars that recognize when you are becoming angry and thus prone to road rage could potentially quell annoying bells and chimes in the car and play some mellow jazz to soothe you. By replacing keys and remote control fobs, biometrics like facial recognition could also make cars more difficult to steal. In its prototype FF 91 sport utility vehicle, the electric car start-up Faraday Future uses an external camera mounted in the door frame to detect the car's owner and automatically unlock the vehicle. Such techniques can create new security challenges, however. In this digital age, our faces are everywhere: in online company profiles, on Twitter accounts, even tagged in friends' Facebook accounts. Finding an image to print out and foil a car's facial recognition system would not be very difficult. Fortunately, engineers have devised high-tech countermeasures. Stereoscopic video cameras, for example, can tell the difference between a flat image and a three-dimensional object. Continental's cameras measure the distance of reflected light off various parts of a person's face, ensuring that it is a real object rather than a high-resolution shot of the owner's visage. ""Some systems have added blink detection and aliveness detection,"" said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer for security at Intel. But he acknowledged that it was still possible to thwart such technology. ""We had 3-D masks printed that we ordered and were able to trick some systems,"" he said. But he said most thieves would be unlikely to go to such extreme lengths to steal a car. ""It all depends on the level of accuracy you need,"" said Yoni Heilbronn, chief marketing officer of Argus Cyber Security, which works with automakers to short-circuit hacking threats. ""Retina scans are even better than facial recognition"" as a potential solution, he said, ""but by adding another level of authentication you lose some of the convenience."" On the other hand, high-tech personalization could be used not only to create amenities for single owners, but also to instantly adapt a vehicle to suit a variety of drivers. Valets, for example, could be automatically prevented from accessing personal information in a navigation system or driving faster than, say, 30 miles per hour. In a ride-sharing situation, such systems could also be used to quickly tailor a car's interior to the physical characteristics of different drivers and passengers. Rental cars would be easier to operate and safer, Mr. Bolton of Continental said. ""If I know where your head is and where your eyes are,"" he said, ""I can adjust the position of the steering wheel and the mirrors so you don't have to fumble looking for the right buttons."" Even airbags could be fine-tuned, reducing the intensity of their deployment depending on the size and position of a driver or young passenger. Some elements of the personalized driving experience are already coming to cars. By the end of the year, Ford plans to add Amazon's Alexa personal assistant  to some of its cars, said Dave Hatton, manager of Ford's mobile applications for connected vehicles. It will not only allow personalized music stations to play with a voice command, but also enable drivers to juggle chores like adding items to an existing grocery list with just a few words. Such convenience may come with some trade-offs on privacy. ""It's a huge concern,"" said John Simpson, privacy project director at Consumer Watchdog, a nonprofit advocacy group. ""All that data is in some database without your consent or knowledge about how it's going to be used,"" he said, adding that there was little if any current government regulation to curtail such use. Using traffic-tracking programs like Waze, some consumers have already signaled their preference for convenience in return for giving up some information like their location. Programmers also point out that such services are optional: You don't have to let the company track you — but then you may get stuck in traffic for 45 minutes. Today, basic biometric technologies like facial recognition software are used for everything from signing into Windows laptops to thwarting toilet paper thieves in Beijing. Fingerprint readers are commonly used to unlock smartphones. As consumers become more accustomed to such systems, the introduction of the technology in vehicles may seem like a natural evolution rather than a creepy intrusion. And it could be fun. Consider the entertainment and social media repercussions in the vein of James Corden's ""Carpool Karaoke"" segments. A built-in camera could record and broadcast your singalong on Facebook or Twitter — assuming the car was in autonomous driving mode. Of course, drivers could grab quick selfies on the road, too. ""It's a novel ideal,"" Mr. Bolton said, ""but remember that an infrared camera makes your face look a little like a skeleton, so it's not that flattering."""
1,2017-04-06," COLORADO SPRINGS — Standing against the backdrop of his New Shepard rocket booster and a full-scale mock capsule for carrying humans into space, Jeff Bezos revealed on Wednesday that he was selling about $1 billion in Amazon stock a year to finance his Blue Origin rocket company. Mr. Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, showed off the reusable rocket booster and the mock-up of the capsule that will take people up for panoramic views back down at earth, during a symposium here. Mr. Bezos, who hopes to build Blue Origin into a commercial and tourist venture, also disclosed that it would cost about $2.5 billion to develop an even bigger rocket, New Glenn, capable of lifting satellites and, eventually, people into orbit. Like his fellow technology titan Elon Musk of SpaceX and Tesla, Mr. Bezos has identified reusable rocket parts as a key to lowering the price of admission to the field, which he said on Wednesday would lead to a ""golden age of space exploration."" ""If we can make access to space low-cost, then entrepreneurs will be unleashed,"" he said. ""You will see creativity, you will see dynamism, you will see the same thing in space that I've witnessed on the internet in the last 20 years."" Last month, Mr. Bezos announced the first-paying customer, Eutelstat, a satellite company, for New Glenn, whose commercial flights would help offset costs. New Glenn is expected to fly by 2020, he said, but humans will not be passengers on the heavy-lift rocket until many years after that. Mr. Bezos has repeatedly expressed caution about setting timetables for the start of Blue Origin's commercial or passenger trips, and he did not diverge from that on Wednesday. He would not say when New Shepard would undergo its next round of test flights, or set a specific date as a goal, merely mentioning next year for possible tourist trips. ""It's a mistake to race to a deadline when you're talking about a flying vehicle, especially one that you're going to put people on,"" he said. ""I still think we can do commercial paying passengers in 2018."" Asked how much passengers would pay, Mr. Bezos said he did not know yet, but he predicted ticket prices would decline as spaceflight became more common. (Hundreds of people have already put down deposits to reserve places on similar commercial trips on Virgin Galactic that could cost $250,000 a ticket, although that company's spaceplane has yet to take anyone up.) New Shepard is a modest start for Mr. Bezos's ambitions to tap into the nascent space tourism market. It is a single-stage booster with a capsule on top that is designed to carry six passengers at a time on trips of about 10 to 11 minutes. There will not be a Blue Origin crew on the spacecraft. Passengers wearing sleek jumpsuits will be able to peer out what the company says will be the largest windows in space, taking up about one-third of the surface area of the dome. About 12 feet in diameter, the passenger capsule holds six black seats that resemble recliners, with panels offering details about altitude and other features of a trip. The engine that powers the booster produces up to about 110,000 pounds of thrust. On ascent, passengers will experience forces of about 3 Gs, about three times the normal force of gravity that humans experience on earth. When the booster reaches a certain altitude, the capsule will detach and coast above the Karman line, which is 62 miles above sea level, officially entering into space. There, the passengers will experience about four to five minutes of weightlessness. They can unbuckle their harnesses and do somersaults, if desired, in the padded-dome interior. On descent, they will encounter forces of 5 Gs. The capsule will parachute back to the plains of West Texas, slowing to a coasting speed of about 20 miles per hour, while the booster drops and fires its engine to slow down and make a vertical landing. The capsule slows to 3 m.p.h. before touching down. Both pieces are reusable to make the trips more economical. ""Reusability is the key to getting millions of people living and working in space,"" Mr. Bezos said. While the concept is similar to the procedures SpaceX has used to recover the boosters for its Falcon 9 rockets, SpaceX's endeavors have been far more challenging, because the boosters must accelerate to speeds of thousands of miles per hour in order to put payloads on a trajectory to reach orbit. Just last week, SpaceX successfully launched a satellite into space with a reused booster, a first for commercial spaceflight. New Shepard has a simpler flight path: just up and down, almost like a big roller coaster that slows to a stop at the top of its arc. However, Mr. Bezos and his Blue Origin team believe that New Shepard, which is expected to fly many times, will give the company ample practice and experience that can be applied to New Glenn, which will be manufactured and launched in Florida. The New Shepard booster on display at the Colorado symposium made five successful up-and-down flights beginning in November 2015. Its last flight, in October, included a test of an emergency-abort system that is designed to blast the capsule — and, eventually, passengers — to safety in case something goes wrong with the booster. The abort system worked. To the pleasant surprise of the engineers, the booster survived the force of separation, righted itself and descended to a landing. (It would have still been considered a successful test if the booster had crashed.) A Virgin Galactic test flight in 2014 crashed, killing one pilot and severely injuring the other. Both Mr. Bezos and Mr. Musk have much more ambitious goals beyond their current rockets. Mr. Musk wants to send settlers to Mars. Mr. Bezos has said his long-term vision involves having millions of people living and working in space."
2,2017-04-06," How to maintain a healthy heart is a surprisingly contentious question. Diet and exercise are crucial, everyone agrees — but the ideal specifics and the relationships among them remain mysterious. Some experts recommend avoiding dietary fats; others endorse fat and low carbohydrates. The impact of high levels of inflammation on heart disease is disputed. And almost no one can agree about how much (or what type of) exercise is optimal. But a study published last month in The Lancet points the way to resolving some of these issues by focusing on the Tsimane, a group of subsistence farmers and hunters living in Bolivia along a tributary of the Amazon River. Anthropologists have learned a lot about the lives of the Tsimane since they began studying them 15 years ago. The men typically spend seven hours or so of every day hunting, fishing or poling their canoes to towns to sell and procure food. The women devote almost as much time to gathering nuts and farming rice, corn and plantains. Men and women each cover roughly eight miles, or 17,000 steps, each day. Their diet is heavy on carbs: 72 percent of their daily calories derive from unprocessed starches, 14 percent from saturated and unsaturated fats and 14 percent from protein. Many Tsimane experience frequent infections and show chronically elevated levels of inflammation. For the Lancet study, anthropologists teamed with cardiologists who drew blood from 705 Tsimane men and women between the ages of 40 and 94. The researchers also conducted cardiac scans, enabling them to score the presence of atherosclerosis, a disease characterized by plaque buildup inside a person's cardiac arteries. A score of 0 meant essentially no detectable disease; 1 to 99, low levels; and 400 or greater would be high. Eighty-five percent of the volunteers scored 0; only 3 percent exceeded 99. Even among those older than 75, only 8 percent exceeded 99. A single person scored higher than 399. As a group, the Tsimane had scores less than one-fifth those of people in the United States or Europe. They exhibited less atherosclerosis than even Japanese women, previously thought to have the world's healthiest arteries. In general, the Tsimane developed the first signs of atherosclerosis almost 25 years later than their counterparts in the industrialized West. The implications of these findings are complex, says Hillard Kaplan, an anthropologist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque and the study's co-author. They raise questions about the effect of fats and carbohydrates on the heart and also about the cardiac impacts of inflammation, which does not contribute noticeably to atherosclerosis among the Tsimane. But Kaplan says the study indicates how essential it is to be very active physically — the Tsimane were in almost constant motion every day. The future of the Tsimane may tell us more about lifestyles and hearts, too. Modernity is intruding into their lives. Some now use motorized canoes, putt-putting up the river instead of poling by hand. Kaplan plans to continue monitoring his Tsimane volunteers. In a few years, their hearts may look more like ours."
3,2017-04-06," ALTO TURIAÇU INDIAN TERRITORY, Brazil — Deep in the Amazon jungle, a squad of nerds is on the loose. One of its members spent more than a decade as an environmental activist for a tree-hugging nonprofit. Another studied Arctic oceanography in Germany. Their commander is a former high school science teacher. But together they have forged one of Latin America's most feared elite fighting units, on the front lines of Brazil's struggle to curb the destruction of the Amazon. The team's commander, Roberto Cabral, laughed when I asked him recently how his assemblage of Special Ops nerds came together. ""In the universe of illegal activities in Amazonia, there's deforestation, gold prospecting, bush meat hunting, clandestine logging and animal smuggling,"" said Mr. Cabral, 48, who was shot in the shoulder in 2015 while pursuing gunmen who were razing tracts of forest. ""We wanted to combat these dealings with brains as well as boots on the ground."" I went on a grueling patrol in March with the nine-member unit, which has the decidedly unglamorous name of Grupo Especializado de Fiscalização, or Specialized Inspection Group. The squad, better known by its Portuguese acronym, GEF (pronounced JEFF-ee), operates in some of the most lawless swaths of the Amazon River basin — places so remote that it takes days to reach them by riverboat or truck from the nearest settlement. Facing such logistical obstacles, GEF, which operates as part of Ibama, Brazil's environmental protection agency, usually patrols in helicopters, using satellite images and intelligence gathered through Ibama's regional offices, to detect deforestation and signs of illegal mining. The unit, which Ibama created in 2014, needs all the help it can get. Deforestation is surging once again in the Brazilian Amazon, climbing 29 percent between August 2015 and July 2016. Nearly two million acres of forest were destroyed during the period, according to estimates by the National Institute for Space Research in Brazil. But even as GEF relies on cutting-edge technology, its missions often resemble an elusively frustrating game of cat and mouse. On the first day that I accompanied an operation in Maranhão State on the fringes of the Amazon, members of the unit rose at 3 a.m. Clad in combat fatigues, body armor and bulletproof helmets, they strapped Taurus assault rifles around their shoulders and journeyed for hours in four-wheel-drive pickup trucks along potholed roads from São Luís, the state capital, to Santa Inês, an outpost in the interior. Then they waited for the weather to improve. Heavy rain prevented the unit's two Bell helicopters from taking off for patrols over Maranhão and the vast neighboring state of Pará. After hours of standing by, the choppers finally lifted off around midday, flying for monotonously long stretches over lands cleared for cattle ranching. ""You have to see the Amazon from above to get a sense of how much of it has already been devastated,"" said Maurício Brichta, 44, an oceanographer who specialized in studying Arctic algae at Germany's Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research before joining Ibama. ""As you can imagine,"" he added with a grin, ""there wasn't much demand in Brazil for expertise in the Arctic regions."" Like nearly everyone else in the unit — which includes forestry engineers, a wildlife biologist, a fisheries specialist, even someone who used to work in advertising — Mr. Brichta said he never expected to take up arms to protect the Amazon. Before this phase in his life, he was a stay-at-home father in Jakarta and New York, cities where his ex-wife was stationed as a diplomat for Brazil's Foreign Ministry. After returning to Brazil, Mr. Brichta said he was drawn to Ibama by the agency's sense of idealism and the strides it had made in lowering deforestation rates from alarmingly high levels at the start of the previous decade. When GEF was created, he made the cut by completing a punishing survival course in which candidates endure jumping out of helicopters, protracted treks through the jungle, foraging for food, treating snakebites, going for long stretches without food and sleep, and training for gun battles and knife fights. ""Obviously, this kind of work isn't for everybody,"" said Eduardo Rafael de Souza, 39, a bearded, chain-smoking military veteran who often pilots the helicopters used for GEF's missions. The unit's members returned in a closelipped mood to Santa Inês after the first day on patrol with nothing to show for their efforts after flying for hours over remote logging roads in search of deforestation crews. Some wondered if there could be moles in Ibama's ranks that could have tipped loggers off about their patrols. Like other parts of Brazil's federal government, Ibama has grappled with its own graft scandals, sometimes involving inspectors effectively acting as double agents to protect the interests of ranchers or logging outfits. But environmental activists argue that a major reason for resurgent deforestation in Brazil involves efforts to reduce Ibama's sway, drawing parallels with the Trump administration's plans to overhaul the Environmental Protection Agency. Since 2013, Ibama's budget was slashed by about 46 percent. Either way, GEF's fortunes shifted on the second day of their patrol. Homing in on indigenous lands where logging crews make forays to illegally extract coveted hardwoods, the squad spotted from the air a makeshift sawmill near the boundary of the Alto Turiaçu Indian Territory, home to the Ka'apor people. ""I saw their helicopter land in a clearing, like a scene out of some Hollywood movie,"" said Francinaldo Martins Araújo, 43, who was arriving in his truck to buy scraps of discarded timber from the sawmill as the unit swooped down for its raid. Members of the squad, some hiding their faces behind balaclavas out of fear of retribution if their identities are made public, quickly went to work. They set the sawmill on fire and destroyed two domed furnaces used to make charcoal, before setting out again in the helicopters for their next target. A few minutes later, they hit pay dirt again when one of the pilots observed a truck on a logging road. The unit jumped out of the choppers in a nearby clearing, as one member punctured the truck's fuel tank and set the vehicle on fire. Then the shouting came from the forest. While searching for the logging crew, two GEF members stumbled across a tractor used for hauling felled trees. A chain saw, still warm from being used minutes earlier, was left stuck in a tree, evidence of a hasty getaway. The unit set fire to the tractor and chain saw before resuming the search for the loggers. Nerves were on edge. It was on such an operation in a nearby jungle that Mr. Cabral, GEF's commander, was taken by surprise by a fleeing logger and wounded by gunfire. No shots were fired this time, but the loggers managed to elude the squad, fleeing into the forest. A pilot radioed the coordinates of the exfiltration point and the unit started the long trek back to the choppers in humidity so thick it felt as if they could slice through it with their hunting knives. Drenched in sweat as they boarded the helicopters, the squad could see the smoke billowing from the destroyed vehicles, a small victory in the battle against deforestation. ""I never dreamed that I would hold a rifle in my hands to defend the Amazon,"" said one 44-year-old GEF member, a former environmental activist who declined to disclose his name because of security fears. ""But this is war, and war can open your eyes to what needs to be done."""
4,2017-04-06," When you shop for cat food online, Amazon knows who you are. When you look for the best airfares for summer vacation, Google knows who you are. Soon, when you get behind the wheel, your car may recognize you, too. Using cameras with facial recognition software and other biometric indicators, automakers are looking to personalize the driving experience with cars that stare back at you, quietly adjusting seats and driving modes. They may even anticipate your wants and desires by playing your favorite music based on your mood. And it's not only about convenience, but also about the possibility of improving safety and security. ""It's not just about personalization,"" said Zachary Bolton, a systems and technology engineer at Continental Automotive Group, explaining the sophistication of such systems. ""We can use the gleam, the twinkle in your eye to determine precisely where you're looking."" Engineers can then dynamically adjust the so-called human machine interface, putting critical information, say, about a stalled car up ahead, or the fact that you are about to exceed the speed limit, directly in a driver's line of sight on the dashboard or in a display on the windshield. Conversely, by tracking downward eye movements, the car could ""see"" that a driver was distracted and sound a warning. Continental has already demonstrated in-car systems that allow drivers to register their faces using something as simple as a driver's license picture. An interior infrared camera is used to overcome potential obstacles like sunglasses, which would stymie a conventional video camera. Putting the camera in the center instrument cluster also helps to pinpoint the driver's eyes, even if she's wearing a hat. The biggest technical challenge — glare caused by sunlight — can be filtered out using machine learning, Mr. Bolton said. Once the car knows who you are, systems in vehicles like the Chrysler Portal concept car would automatically adjust the seat for maximum comfort, select a driving mode (for example, one driver likes to let the car do most of the work; another likes taking control in sport mode) and suggest a destination based on the owner's past behavior. Watching a driver's face can also give a car important clues about that person's state of mind. For several years, carmakers like Ford and tech companies like Intel have been interested in determining whether a driver is happy or sad. Depending on your mood, a car could change its tune, playing a bouncy Beach Boys song and changing the interior lighting to improve your attitude. Honda's NeuV concept car, for example, has a large customizable LCD dashboard and a cloud-connected, onboard computer that uses artificial intelligence to interact with drivers. NeuV employs what the company coyly refers to as an ""emotion engine"" to grease the wheels of the conversation, and its automated personal assistant can read ""facial skin vibrations"" to help it isolate the driver's voice and better understand spoken commands. There are practical reasons as well, designers say, for detecting a driver's emotional state: A calm driver is a safer driver. So cars that recognize when you are becoming angry and thus prone to road rage could potentially quell annoying bells and chimes in the car and play some mellow jazz to soothe you. By replacing keys and remote control fobs, biometrics like facial recognition could also make cars more difficult to steal. In its prototype FF 91 sport utility vehicle, the electric car start-up Faraday Future uses an external camera mounted in the door frame to detect the car's owner and automatically unlock the vehicle. Such techniques can create new security challenges, however. In this digital age, our faces are everywhere: in online company profiles, on Twitter accounts, even tagged in friends' Facebook accounts. Finding an image to print out and foil a car's facial recognition system would not be very difficult. Fortunately, engineers have devised high-tech countermeasures. Stereoscopic video cameras, for example, can tell the difference between a flat image and a three-dimensional object. Continental's cameras measure the distance of reflected light off various parts of a person's face, ensuring that it is a real object rather than a high-resolution shot of the owner's visage. ""Some systems have added blink detection and aliveness detection,"" said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer for security at Intel. But he acknowledged that it was still possible to thwart such technology. ""We had 3-D masks printed that we ordered and were able to trick some systems,"" he said. But he said most thieves would be unlikely to go to such extreme lengths to steal a car. ""It all depends on the level of accuracy you need,"" said Yoni Heilbronn, chief marketing officer of Argus Cyber Security, which works with automakers to short-circuit hacking threats. ""Retina scans are even better than facial recognition"" as a potential solution, he said, ""but by adding another level of authentication you lose some of the convenience."" On the other hand, high-tech personalization could be used not only to create amenities for single owners, but also to instantly adapt a vehicle to suit a variety of drivers. Valets, for example, could be automatically prevented from accessing personal information in a navigation system or driving faster than, say, 30 miles per hour. In a ride-sharing situation, such systems could also be used to quickly tailor a car's interior to the physical characteristics of different drivers and passengers. Rental cars would be easier to operate and safer, Mr. Bolton of Continental said. ""If I know where your head is and where your eyes are,"" he said, ""I can adjust the position of the steering wheel and the mirrors so you don't have to fumble looking for the right buttons."" Even airbags could be fine-tuned, reducing the intensity of their deployment depending on the size and position of a driver or young passenger. Some elements of the personalized driving experience are already coming to cars. By the end of the year, Ford plans to add Amazon's Alexa personal assistant  to some of its cars, said Dave Hatton, manager of Ford's mobile applications for connected vehicles. It will not only allow personalized music stations to play with a voice command, but also enable drivers to juggle chores like adding items to an existing grocery list with just a few words. Such convenience may come with some trade-offs on privacy. ""It's a huge concern,"" said John Simpson, privacy project director at Consumer Watchdog, a nonprofit advocacy group. ""All that data is in some database without your consent or knowledge about how it's going to be used,"" he said, adding that there was little if any current government regulation to curtail such use. Using traffic-tracking programs like Waze, some consumers have already signaled their preference for convenience in return for giving up some information like their location. Programmers also point out that such services are optional: You don't have to let the company track you — but then you may get stuck in traffic for 45 minutes. Today, basic biometric technologies like facial recognition software are used for everything from signing into Windows laptops to thwarting toilet paper thieves in Beijing. Fingerprint readers are commonly used to unlock smartphones. As consumers become more accustomed to such systems, the introduction of the technology in vehicles may seem like a natural evolution rather than a creepy intrusion. And it could be fun. Consider the entertainment and social media repercussions in the vein of James Corden's ""Carpool Karaoke"" segments. A built-in camera could record and broadcast your singalong on Facebook or Twitter — assuming the car was in autonomous driving mode. Of course, drivers could grab quick selfies on the road, too. ""It's a novel ideal,"" Mr. Bolton said, ""but remember that an infrared camera makes your face look a little like a skeleton, so it's not that flattering."""
5,2017-04-06," COLORADO SPRINGS — Standing against the backdrop of his New Shepard rocket booster and a full-scale mock capsule for carrying humans into space, Jeff Bezos revealed on Wednesday that he was selling about $1 billion in Amazon stock a year to finance his Blue Origin rocket company. Mr. Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, showed off the reusable rocket booster and the mock-up of the capsule that will take people up for panoramic views back down at earth, during a symposium here. Mr. Bezos, who hopes to build Blue Origin into a commercial and tourist venture, also disclosed that it would cost about $2.5 billion to develop an even bigger rocket, New Glenn, capable of lifting satellites and, eventually, people into orbit. Like his fellow technology titan Elon Musk of SpaceX and Tesla, Mr. Bezos has identified reusable rocket parts as a key to lowering the price of admission to the field, which he said on Wednesday would lead to a ""golden age of space exploration."" ""If we can make access to space low-cost, then entrepreneurs will be unleashed,"" he said. ""You will see creativity, you will see dynamism, you will see the same thing in space that I've witnessed on the internet in the last 20 years."" Last month, Mr. Bezos announced the first-paying customer, Eutelstat, a satellite company, for New Glenn, whose commercial flights would help offset costs. New Glenn is expected to fly by 2020, he said, but humans will not be passengers on the heavy-lift rocket until many years after that. Mr. Bezos has repeatedly expressed caution about setting timetables for the start of Blue Origin's commercial or passenger trips, and he did not diverge from that on Wednesday. He would not say when New Shepard would undergo its next round of test flights, or set a specific date as a goal, merely mentioning next year for possible tourist trips. ""It's a mistake to race to a deadline when you're talking about a flying vehicle, especially one that you're going to put people on,"" he said. ""I still think we can do commercial paying passengers in 2018."" Asked how much passengers would pay, Mr. Bezos said he did not know yet, but he predicted ticket prices would decline as spaceflight became more common. (Hundreds of people have already put down deposits to reserve places on similar commercial trips on Virgin Galactic that could cost $250,000 a ticket, although that company's spaceplane has yet to take anyone up.) New Shepard is a modest start for Mr. Bezos's ambitions to tap into the nascent space tourism market. It is a single-stage booster with a capsule on top that is designed to carry six passengers at a time on trips of about 10 to 11 minutes. There will not be a Blue Origin crew on the spacecraft. Passengers wearing sleek jumpsuits will be able to peer out what the company says will be the largest windows in space, taking up about one-third of the surface area of the dome. About 12 feet in diameter, the passenger capsule holds six black seats that resemble recliners, with panels offering details about altitude and other features of a trip. The engine that powers the booster produces up to about 110,000 pounds of thrust. On ascent, passengers will experience forces of about 3 Gs, about three times the normal force of gravity that humans experience on earth. When the booster reaches a certain altitude, the capsule will detach and coast above the Karman line, which is 62 miles above sea level, officially entering into space. There, the passengers will experience about four to five minutes of weightlessness. They can unbuckle their harnesses and do somersaults, if desired, in the padded-dome interior. On descent, they will encounter forces of 5 Gs. The capsule will parachute back to the plains of West Texas, slowing to a coasting speed of about 20 miles per hour, while the booster drops and fires its engine to slow down and make a vertical landing. The capsule slows to 3 m.p.h. before touching down. Both pieces are reusable to make the trips more economical. ""Reusability is the key to getting millions of people living and working in space,"" Mr. Bezos said. While the concept is similar to the procedures SpaceX has used to recover the boosters for its Falcon 9 rockets, SpaceX's endeavors have been far more challenging, because the boosters must accelerate to speeds of thousands of miles per hour in order to put payloads on a trajectory to reach orbit. Just last week, SpaceX successfully launched a satellite into space with a reused booster, a first for commercial spaceflight. New Shepard has a simpler flight path: just up and down, almost like a big roller coaster that slows to a stop at the top of its arc. However, Mr. Bezos and his Blue Origin team believe that New Shepard, which is expected to fly many times, will give the company ample practice and experience that can be applied to New Glenn, which will be manufactured and launched in Florida. The New Shepard booster on display at the Colorado symposium made five successful up-and-down flights beginning in November 2015. Its last flight, in October, included a test of an emergency-abort system that is designed to blast the capsule — and, eventually, passengers — to safety in case something goes wrong with the booster. The abort system worked. To the pleasant surprise of the engineers, the booster survived the force of separation, righted itself and descended to a landing. (It would have still been considered a successful test if the booster had crashed.) A Virgin Galactic test flight in 2014 crashed, killing one pilot and severely injuring the other. Both Mr. Bezos and Mr. Musk have much more ambitious goals beyond their current rockets. Mr. Musk wants to send settlers to Mars. Mr. Bezos has said his long-term vision involves having millions of people living and working in space."
6,2017-04-06," How to maintain a healthy heart is a surprisingly contentious question. Diet and exercise are crucial, everyone agrees — but the ideal specifics and the relationships among them remain mysterious. Some experts recommend avoiding dietary fats; others endorse fat and low carbohydrates. The impact of high levels of inflammation on heart disease is disputed. And almost no one can agree about how much (or what type of) exercise is optimal. But a study published last month in The Lancet points the way to resolving some of these issues by focusing on the Tsimane, a group of subsistence farmers and hunters living in Bolivia along a tributary of the Amazon River. Anthropologists have learned a lot about the lives of the Tsimane since they began studying them 15 years ago. The men typically spend seven hours or so of every day hunting, fishing or poling their canoes to towns to sell and procure food. The women devote almost as much time to gathering nuts and farming rice, corn and plantains. Men and women each cover roughly eight miles, or 17,000 steps, each day. Their diet is heavy on carbs: 72 percent of their daily calories derive from unprocessed starches, 14 percent from saturated and unsaturated fats and 14 percent from protein. Many Tsimane experience frequent infections and show chronically elevated levels of inflammation. For the Lancet study, anthropologists teamed with cardiologists who drew blood from 705 Tsimane men and women between the ages of 40 and 94. The researchers also conducted cardiac scans, enabling them to score the presence of atherosclerosis, a disease characterized by plaque buildup inside a person's cardiac arteries. A score of 0 meant essentially no detectable disease; 1 to 99, low levels; and 400 or greater would be high. Eighty-five percent of the volunteers scored 0; only 3 percent exceeded 99. Even among those older than 75, only 8 percent exceeded 99. A single person scored higher than 399. As a group, the Tsimane had scores less than one-fifth those of people in the United States or Europe. They exhibited less atherosclerosis than even Japanese women, previously thought to have the world's healthiest arteries. In general, the Tsimane developed the first signs of atherosclerosis almost 25 years later than their counterparts in the industrialized West. The implications of these findings are complex, says Hillard Kaplan, an anthropologist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque and the study's co-author. They raise questions about the effect of fats and carbohydrates on the heart and also about the cardiac impacts of inflammation, which does not contribute noticeably to atherosclerosis among the Tsimane. But Kaplan says the study indicates how essential it is to be very active physically — the Tsimane were in almost constant motion every day. The future of the Tsimane may tell us more about lifestyles and hearts, too. Modernity is intruding into their lives. Some now use motorized canoes, putt-putting up the river instead of poling by hand. Kaplan plans to continue monitoring his Tsimane volunteers. In a few years, their hearts may look more like ours."
7,2017-04-06," ALTO TURIAÇU INDIAN TERRITORY, Brazil — Deep in the Amazon jungle, a squad of nerds is on the loose. One of its members spent more than a decade as an environmental activist for a tree-hugging nonprofit. Another studied Arctic oceanography in Germany. Their commander is a former high school science teacher. But together they have forged one of Latin America's most feared elite fighting units, on the front lines of Brazil's struggle to curb the destruction of the Amazon. The team's commander, Roberto Cabral, laughed when I asked him recently how his assemblage of Special Ops nerds came together. ""In the universe of illegal activities in Amazonia, there's deforestation, gold prospecting, bush meat hunting, clandestine logging and animal smuggling,"" said Mr. Cabral, 48, who was shot in the shoulder in 2015 while pursuing gunmen who were razing tracts of forest. ""We wanted to combat these dealings with brains as well as boots on the ground."" I went on a grueling patrol in March with the nine-member unit, which has the decidedly unglamorous name of Grupo Especializado de Fiscalização, or Specialized Inspection Group. The squad, better known by its Portuguese acronym, GEF (pronounced JEFF-ee), operates in some of the most lawless swaths of the Amazon River basin — places so remote that it takes days to reach them by riverboat or truck from the nearest settlement. Facing such logistical obstacles, GEF, which operates as part of Ibama, Brazil's environmental protection agency, usually patrols in helicopters, using satellite images and intelligence gathered through Ibama's regional offices, to detect deforestation and signs of illegal mining. The unit, which Ibama created in 2014, needs all the help it can get. Deforestation is surging once again in the Brazilian Amazon, climbing 29 percent between August 2015 and July 2016. Nearly two million acres of forest were destroyed during the period, according to estimates by the National Institute for Space Research in Brazil. But even as GEF relies on cutting-edge technology, its missions often resemble an elusively frustrating game of cat and mouse. On the first day that I accompanied an operation in Maranhão State on the fringes of the Amazon, members of the unit rose at 3 a.m. Clad in combat fatigues, body armor and bulletproof helmets, they strapped Taurus assault rifles around their shoulders and journeyed for hours in four-wheel-drive pickup trucks along potholed roads from São Luís, the state capital, to Santa Inês, an outpost in the interior.

0,2017-04-07," COOL CAT: For a pretty chill dude, the children's book character Pete the Cat keeps himself impressively busy. Since 2010 he has appeared in 10 best-selling picture books — the first, ""Pete the Cat: I Love My White Shoes,"" spent more than two years on the list and paved the way for Pete to admire the ""four groovy buttons"" on his favorite shirt, to wear magic sunglasses, to save Christmas and to offer groovy guides to life and love, among other things. (""Pete the Cat: Big Easter Adventure"" is currently No. 2 in its third week on the picture book list.) And he's about to get busier still: A puppet show based on the character just opened in Atlanta, a musical opened in Connecticut and an animated TV show is coming from Amazon. (Elvis Costello and Diana Krall will voice Pete's parents — an inspired choice, given the character's slightly louche vibe and his almost certain love of jazz standards and lounge rock.) Behind all of this is the author and illustrator James Dean, who collaborated on the first few books with Eric Litwin and has since worked with his wife, Kimberly Dean. ""I didn't really want to be a cat artist,"" Dean told The Atlanta Journal Constitution last month. But after selling landscapes at art fairs for a number of years, Dean painted a picture of his cat (yes, his name is Pete) and found that it struck a nerve. ""I took it to a show, and this lady who saw it on a Saturday came back on Sunday saying: 'I just have to have it. I couldn't get this thing off my mind,'"" Dean said. ""I've never had somebody have that reaction to something I'd painted."" The move to children's books came naturally, after Litwin approached Dean with the idea for ""I Love My White Shoes."" ""It's about stepping in blueberries and strawberries, but all the adults know it was about stepping in crap,"" Dean said. ""I love that it's edgy, and it just has everything for me."" THE WORKSHOP: Jessica Shattuck's historical novel ""The Women in the Castle,"" about Nazi wives and war widows, enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 6. A couple of years ago, juggling the demands of writing and raising kids (she has three), Shattuck formed a writers' group with some other Boston-area novelist moms: Emily Franklin, Rachel Kadish, Tova Mirvis, Heidi Pitlor and Joanna Rakoff. ""Publishing is such a solitary profession,"" Shattuck told The Boston Globe last month, that meeting in a workshop atmosphere is a ""relief valve"" of sorts. ""Writers can be competitive,"" she said. ""This group was formed to be in opposition to that."""
0,2017-04-09," TORONTO — Long before Google started working on cars that drive themselves and Amazon was creating home appliances that talk, a handful of researchers in Canada — backed by the Canadian government and universities — were laying the groundwork for today's boom in artificial intelligence. But the center of the commercial gold rush has been a long way away, in Silicon Valley. In recent years, many of Canada's young A.I. scientists, lured by lucrative paydays from Google, Facebook, Apple and other companies, have departed. Canada is producing a growing number of A.I start-ups, but they often head to California, where venture capital, business skills and optimism are abundant. ""Canada is not really reaping the benefits from this A.I. technical leadership and decades of investment by the Canadian government,"" said Tiff Macklem, former senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, who is dean of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto. Now bringing A.I. home is a priority for the Canadian government, companies, universities and technologists. The goal, they say, is to build a business environment around the country's expertise and to keep the experts its universities create in the country. And they want to build on the tenacity of veteran researchers like Geoffrey Hinton, Richard Sutton and Yoshua Bengio, who developed techniques that opened the door to remarkable improvements in an A.I. technology called machine learning, even as many computer scientists and the tech industry considered their work to be an unpromising backwater. There are encouraging signs, including new government funding, big company investments, programs to nurture start-ups, and the changing habits of homegrown entrepreneurs and American venture capitalists. In its new budget, the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pledged $93 million ($125 million Canadian) to support A.I. research centers in Toronto, Montreal and Edmonton, which will be public-private collaborations. The Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Toronto, announced two weeks ago, will be one of them. The institute begins with commitments of $130 million, about half the money coming from the national and provincial governments and the other half from corporate sponsors like Google, Accenture and Nvidia, as well as big Canadian companies like the Royal Bank of Canada, Scotiabank and Air Canada. Mr. Hinton, who was hired by Google in 2013 but remains a professor at the University of Toronto, will serve as its chief scientific adviser. The new institute will be in the Mars Discovery District, a cluster of buildings in downtown Toronto, run by a public-private partnership, that is home to many tech start-ups including A.I. companies.. Major technology companies, like Google, Microsoft and IBM, are adding to their A.I. research teams in Canada. So are companies in other industries. Last year, General Motors said it was going to locate one of its research and engineering hubs for self-driving cars in the Toronto suburb of Markham. And Thomson Reuters announced it would open a center for ""cognitive computing"" in Toronto for research into new ways professionals will use information and technologies to assist decision making. Building businesses that use A.I. is an economic imperative for Canada. The Canadian tech industry has stalled in recent years. Nortel, Canada's big telecommunications equipment maker, declared bankruptcy in 2009, and was wound down over the next several years. And BlackBerry, once a leader, has faded in the smartphone market. The experience of two start-ups applying A.I. technology to drug discovery illustrate the challenges — and the opportunities — facing Canadian start-ups. Atomwise, a company that uses A.I. technology to predict what new molecules might combat specific diseases like multiple sclerosis, was founded in 2012. Its chief executive, Abraham Heifets, earned his Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Toronto. When Mr. Heifets sought funding, he recalled, one potential Canadian investor said people had tried the same thing 20 years ago. ""What could possibly be new?"" Mr. Heifets said the investor had asked, and turned him down. Later, Mr. Heifets went to the Bay Area and met with Timothy Draper, founder of the venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson. Mr. Draper observed that he had invested in a couple of companies trying a similar approach 20 years ago. That didn't deter him from trying again. ""That's a cultural issue, a different appetite for risk and willingness to accept failure,"" Mr. Heifets said. Atomwise moved to San Francisco to be close to its investors and the region's enormous talent pool. By contrast, Deep Genomics, founded in 2014, has stayed in Canada, and its American-based venture backers encouraged it to remain in Toronto. Brendan Frey, the chief executive, studied under Mr. Hinton at the University of Toronto, and he has spent years on research that combines deep-learning A.I. and cell biology. When he hires software engineers, he asks them to make multiyear commitments. ""There are a lot of distractions in the Bay Area,"" said Mr. Frey, who is also a professor at the University of Toronto and a co-founder of the new Vector institute. ""The hype is a little too hot down there. Besides, we have some of the best talent in the world here."" Both Atomwise and Deep Genomics were participants in different years in a program called the Creative Destruction Lab. Founded in 2012 by Ajay Agrawal, a professor at the Rotman School, the lab was set up to help technology-intensive start-ups. They are typically founded by a Ph.D. scientist who has worked on an idea for five years, but has little or no business experience. In 2015, the program tilted toward A.I. start-ups, with 25 companies admitted. Last year, 50 A.I. start-ups were admitted, and this year will likely have 75, Mr. Agrawal said. The program lasts nine months, with fall and spring terms, much like a school year. The participants gather every eight weeks in Toronto for two days to make presentations, listen to advice and set goals for the next eight weeks. At every gathering, at least one and sometimes several companies are voted out. The voters are a growing group of tech entrepreneurs and investors whom Mr. Agrawal has recruited. One of the X factors in Canada's drive to develop an A.I. industry is the Trump administration. Canadian A.I. scientists say they have received a stream of inquiries from researchers in the United States, concerned about the new administration's stance on immigration and other policies. Should there be a northward migration it wouldn't the first time. Mr. Hinton settled in Canada in 1987 in part because of America's clandestine support for the Contra guerrillas who sought to overthrow the left-wing Sandinista government in Nicaragua. Mr. Hinton, who is from Britain, was at Carnegie Mellon University at the time, and he realized that continuing his research in America would have meant accepting funding from the Reagan administration. ""I preferred Canada,"" Mr. Hinton recalled. Mr. Sutton left the United States to become a professor at the University of Alberta in 2003, after American troops landed in Baghdad. ""George Bush was invading Iraq,"" he said. ""It was a good time to leave."""
0,2017-04-10," Narrowed, aging blood vessels, which put most older American adults at risk for heart disease and strokes, are not inevitable. This fact was underscored by a newly published study of a population in the Bolivian Amazon. Among these indigenous South Americans, known as the Tsimane (pronounced chee-MAH-nay), coronary atherosclerosis was found to be one-fifth as common than in the United States. CT scans of the hearts of 705 Tsimane adults aged 40 to 94 revealed that nearly nine in 10 had clean coronary arteries and faced no risk of heart disease. The research team estimated that an 80-year-old in the Tsimane group has the same vascular age as an American in his mid-50s. I'll return to the likely reasons and the lifesaving lessons we can all learn from them even now after a discussion of a half-century of improvements in the heart health of Americans. In the early 1960s, when I began writing about science and health, American hearts were in dismal condition. Heart disease, an uncommon cause of death at the turn of the 20th century, had become the most common cause of death by midcentury. Coronary mortality peaked in 1968, when it was not unusual for Americans to die of a heart attack in their 50s or 60s. At the time, about 40 percent of adults smoked, doctors deemed a cholesterol level of 240 milligrams per deciliter to be ""normal,"" and nearly half of young adults had blood pressure readings now considered high. Had the coronary death rate continued its meteoric rise, today more than 1.7 million Americans would succumb to heart disease each year. Instead, there's been a significant decline, to some 425,000 deaths a year, with a commensurate increase in longevity of 8.7 years between 1970 and 2010. More than 70 percent of the rise in life expectancy is attributable to fewer deaths from cardiovascular disease, primarily heart attacks and strokes. The countless millions who have escaped a premature cardiovascular death can thank in part a half-century of public health measures and other preventive medicine initiatives that are now threatened by proposed cuts in the nation's budget. The fall in cigarette smoking alone had a major impact, having declined to about 15 percent of adults. (Alas, teenagers, whose smoking rates were once well below those of adults, have all but caught up.) Smoking by itself increases the risk of heart disease; it raises blood pressure, diminishes exercise tolerance, decreases protective HDL cholesterol, and increases the blood's tendency to clot. But when smoking is combined with other coronary risk factors, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity or Type 2 diabetes, the risks of a heart attack, stroke and an early coronary death are greatly increased. A decline in average blood levels of cholesterol also played an important role in the drop in coronary deaths. Today only about 12 percent of American adults have high total cholesterol levels — 240 milligrams or greater, although nearly a third still have elevated levels — 130 milligrams or more — of artery-damaging LDL cholesterol. People with high total cholesterol face nearly twice the risk for heart disease as those with ideal levels (200 milligrams or less), and a high level of LDL cholesterol – above 100 milligrams — is even more problematic. Yet even now, fewer than half of adults with elevated LDL levels are being treated to reduce it. Recognizing and treating high blood pressure, based on the findings of a slew of studies of promising medications, has helped to save the hearts and lives of countless Americans who might otherwise have succumbed to coronary disease since its peak incidence. Nonetheless, today one adult in three has high blood pressure, and of those only half have it under control. Another third of adults have blood pressure that is higher than normal, though not yet in the high blood pressure range. Thus, poor treatment remains a serious contributor to cardiovascular disease and deaths. Too often, the American approach to heart disease amounts to shutting the barn door after the horse has escaped. Once in trouble with life-threatening arterial damage, patients are usually treated with stents in hopes of keeping the vessels from closing down, at a cost of $30,000 to $50,000 for each procedure. But while having a stent in place can indeed be helpful for those in the throes of a heart attack, at least eight randomized clinical trials found that for people with stable coronary artery disease, they offer no benefit over standard noninvasive medical treatment — diet, exercise and perhaps treatment with an inexpensive statin. Yet, more than half of stable coronary patients, who may have symptoms like chest pain during vigorous exercise, are treated with stents before they've tried conservative therapy. So what can we learn from the Tsimane? Are medications, treatment with stents and other costly procedures our only hope for cutting coronary mortality further? Yes, if millions of Americans continue to spurn changes in their living habits that have been shown over and over again to be protective. The Tsimane have a forager-horticulturist lifestyle. Tsimane men are physically active for an average of six to seven hours a day — accumulating about 17,000 steps a day — and Tsimane women are active for four to six hours a day, walking about 15,000 steps a day. Smoking is rare in this population. The Tsimane diet derives 72 percent of its calories from carbohydrates, though not the overly refined starches and sugars consumed by most Americans. The Tsimane eat unprocessed complex carbs high in fiber, like brown rice, plantain, manioc, corn, nuts and fruits. But the Tsimane are not vegetarians. Protein accounts for 14 percent of their calories and comes primarily from animal meats that, unlike American meats, are very low in artery-clogging saturated fat. This does not mean we must return to hunting and gathering or subsistence farming to protect our hearts. But we'd do well to adapt the Tsimane example and modify our modern high-fat, highly processed, low-fiber and high-sugar diet and our extremely sedentary lifestyle. Most Americans today are nearly or completely inactive. Barely 20 percent of adults get the recommended minimum of 30 minutes a day of physical activity, and fewer than half of adults get enough activity to achieve any meaningful health benefits. In fact, a new study by researchers at Columbia University Medical Center found that only 16 percent of heart attack survivors get enough activity following hospital discharge: In the first two weeks, at least 30 minutes a day of moderate aerobic exercise like brisk walking at least five days a week is recommended."

1,2017-04-13," In ""The Lost City of Z,"" a lush, melancholic story of discovery and mystery, a mesmerizing Charlie Hunnam plays a British adventurer in the Amazon who is consumed by ""all the glories of exploration,"" as Joseph Conrad once wrote of a different journey. Enveloped by the forest, the explorer and his crew face snakes, piranhas, insects and that most terrifying of threats: other people, who at times bombard the strangers with arrows. Undaunted, he perseveres, venturing more deeply into a world that first becomes a passion and then something of a private hallucination. It's 1906, and while wonders like moving pictures are rapidly shrinking the world, the dream of unknown lands endures. That dream isn't only about the Amazon in ""The Lost City of Z"" but also about the movies and their ability to transport us to astonishing new worlds. For us, the Age of Discovery is long gone and, for the most part, so are old-fashioned historical epics, other than the occasional Chinese extravaganza or one of those international waxworks with clashing accents. Hollywood used to churn these out regularly, but they've faded, casualties of shifting industry logic, audience taste, cultural norms and other pressures. The romance of adventure has largely shifted from history to fantasy fiction, an easier, less contested playground for conquering white heroes. In ""The Lost City of Z,"" the writer-director James Gray has set out to make a film in the colonial era that suggests the likes of David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" but through a sensitive, contemporary lens. It's one that starts from the premise that while white men have long been the keepers of the historical record, they didn't make the past single-handedly. The story that Mr. Gray has chosen seems an unlikely candidate for such revisionism because it turns on Lieut. Col. Percy Harrison Fawcett, who came to believe in the existence of a lost Amazonian civilization. He called it the lost city of Z; others called it El Dorado, a European illusion that proved catastrophic for the New World. The movie opens shortly before Fawcett is approached by the Royal Geographical Society to map uncharted territory in Bolivia. A career soldier and son of a disgraced aristocrat, Fawcett is anxious to change his fortunes and increase his social standing. Leaving behind, rather too easily, his loving wife, Nina (Sienna Miller, wonderful), and their young son (later played by Tom Holland), he sets off and is soon struggling through the Amazon with a small crew that includes an aide-de-camp, Henry Costin (an excellent Robert Pattinson, shaggy and almost unrecognizable). Deep in a jungle, where each wonder is matched by terror, Fawcett is ravaged — and then transformed — by his discoveries of both a new world and another self. Mr. Gray opens this world gloriously. As a director, he has an old-fashioned belief in cinematic beauty, in the charm and necessity of the perfectly lighted and framed face, the hauntingly darkened room, the grittily coarsened street. He's a sensualist, and in ""The Lost City of Z"" he turns the Amazon into a ravishment for the senses. (The cinematographer, Darius Khondji, who goes dark brilliantly, shot Mr. Gray's last film, ""The Immigrant."") As Fawcett presses on, walking and sailing through dense shadow, streaming light and canopies of variegated green, the natural world comes fantastically alive with strange animal cries, stirring trees, roiling fog and frighteningly violent eddies. In time, native peoples emerge from those trees, by turns watchful, threatening and welcoming. Much as he does throughout his Amazonian travels, Fawcett is enlivened by his encounters with the Indians. He's a natural, somewhat surprisingly peaceful ambassador given his background and historical moment (even if his restraint also nicely suits Mr. Hunnam's slow-burning charisma). When his expedition comes under siege at one point, he orders his men not to fire and instead waves a kerchief while calling out ""Amigo!"" It's a stratagem, but Fawcett's curiosity is boundless and he sees accomplishment and complexity in this world, which sharply goes against bigoted orthodoxies back home. Mr. Gray, working from David Grann's 2009 book, ""The Lost City of Z,"" glosses over Fawcett's more noxious beliefs. Mr. Grann, for one, writes that Fawcett ""escaped virtually every kind of pathology in the jungle, but he could not rid himself of the pernicious disease of race."" It's no surprise that the real Fawcett was as fascinatingly contradictory as you might expect of a Victorian-born British explorer. Mr. Gray doesn't soften all of these uncomfortable edges — there is arrogance and tinges of cruelty in this portrait — but he's far more interested in what seems to have distinguished Fawcett, namely his passionate belief that Amazonian Indians were not the primitives the West insisted they were. That passion sends Fawcett back to the Amazon several more times over the years, eventually becoming a kind of steadily devouring fever. He's hailed as a hero after he returns from his first trip, but by the time he's home he has a new child, whose birth he missed. This sets the template for his life, as Fawcett increasingly gives himself over to the Amazon and neglects his family, a familiar divide that Mr. Gray turns into the story's axis point. In most movies of this type, the great man kisses the little woman goodbye and sets off. Here, partly because Fawcett repeatedly returns home, Nina emerges as a substantial narrative force and not only a reminder of what he's willing to sacrifice. Fawcett finds ecstasy in and out of the Amazon, as does Mr. Gray, who fills the screen with intimate reveries and overwhelming spectacle, including a harrowing interlude during World War I. Until now, Mr. Gray has tended to work on a somewhat modest scale, often with art films that play with genre. Here, he effortlessly expands his reach as he moves across time and continents and in the process turns the past into a singular life. There's much to love in this film, but what lingers are those lapidary details that often go missing in stories about great men, as if they had built the world alone and no child had ever raced down a road waving goodbye as a father disappeared into history."

0,2017-04-15," The way we choose to shop, and the way retailers decide to sell us things, is an ever evolving relationship. And as new ideas emerge and come to dominate (""It's one place with everything — a department store!"") they inevitably fall out of favor and give way to the next brainstorm (think Amazon's 1-Click). In central New Jersey, monuments to retail's changing fortunes can be found within a short drive of each other, helping document the past, present and the future of shopping. When the Burlington Center Mall opened in Burlington Township in 1982, it meant shoppers did not have to travel to downtown Trenton or even Philadelphia for the latest fashions, children's high chairs or gas-powered lawn mowers. Thirty-five years later, the edifice still stands, but the mall is barely there. After Macy's and J. C. Penney closed, it was only a matter of time before smaller stores began shutting their doors for good. About 20 miles to the north, on what was once farmland, there is a beehive of activity. In the predawn light, buses pick up and drop off workers who enter a gigantic low-slung building. At Amazon's fulfillment center in Robbinsville, N.J., more than 4,000 people and an indeterminate number of robots store, pick, pack and ship the company's countless inventory, sometimes for same-day delivery. Inside the building, 10 miles of conveyor belts are the veins and arteries of this outpost of the e-commerce giant. Following in Amazon's giant footsteps, other e-commerce companies are providing a more specialized retail service. In Cranbury, a 15-minute drive from Robbinsville, Wayfair, an online retailer that focuses on home goods, has a warehouse that covers 1.2 million square feet and stands 40 feet tall. The inventory ranges from teakettles to brass beds, all stored on shelves and available for two-day free shipping. The idea is that you can buy your next couch without getting up from your couch. But for all the attention and urgency that online shopping attracts, the vast majority of purchases are still made in person, in places like Kmart in Hamilton Township, before a checkout counter, with a purse or wallet in hand. In the last three months of 2016, Americans spent $102.7 billion in online sales, which was 8.3 percent of the overall total of $1.24 trillion in retail sales. Many of those dollars were spent at strip malls, sometimes known as power centers in the trade. But don't confuse familiarity with success. Sears, which owns Kmart stores, announced in January it would close 109 Kmart locations. And last month, its parent company said there was ""substantial doubt"" that it could continue operating. Stories like these mean that we are increasingly confronted with the carcasses of retail's past. ""Zombie malls,"" as they are known, are increasingly dotting the suburban landscape. The lights are on, the escalators keep moving, but their purpose in life has gone. Burlington Center has less than 20 tenants — including a Sears and a Foot Locker — but once had more than 100. Last Wednesday a woman came to the mall looking for shoes, and left frustrated because the Payless store had just shuttered. Two years ago the mall's owners announced a $230 million renovation that would include an open-air town center. But the plans have stalled. Not all Americans, however, have given up on malls, and for a handful of properties around the country, times have never been so good. About an hour north of Burlington Center is the Mall at Short Hills, in Millburn Township, which boasts four big-name anchors — Bloomingdale's, Macy's, Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom — as well as stores like Tiffany & Co. and Bulgari. Shoppers can arrange for same-day home delivery of purchases; for those wanting to stay longer, the mall helpfully offers a list of nearby hotels and inns. The Mall at Short Hills is part of a rare breed, benefiting from a wealthy demographic (the Millburn, Morristown and Summit areas) and an evolving lineup of tenants and services. Of the more than 1,300 malls analyzed by Green Street Advisors, a research and advisory firm, it is one of only about 35 to attain an A++ rating, based on metrics like sales per square foot, quality of anchor tenants and other factors. The buying experience continues to morph. In just the past decade, cheaper internet access and the arrival of smartphones pushed traditional retailers onto the web. Now, some of these web retailers are beginning to cross back into the brick-and-mortar world. Amazon has opened a handful of bookstores, appealing to those who like to touch and feel (and smell?) their books before buying. Bonobos, an online retailer of men's clothing, is further blurring these distinctions. Saying ""it's not the perfect fit before you try it on,"" Bonobos has opened more than 30 shops around the country where customers can try on clothes and find the best fit. But you don't walk out of the store with your purchase — instead, you walk out empty-handed. What you bought is shipped to your door. The atmosphere was hushed in a Bonobos store in Manhattan this past week. Shoppers tend to make appointments, a representative said, and weekends can become especially busy. One reason for the success of some retail operations are property owners who can ""pivot to meet market demands,"" said DJ Busch, managing director at Green Street Advisors. ""Those are the ones that can weather the changes in the marketplace."" This often means more emphasis on dining and entertainment. For failing malls, Mr. Busch said, it could mean sacrificing mall space for office or residential development."
0,2017-04-19," BEIJING — When Amazon announced its entry into the Chinese cloud computing market last year, Chinese state media celebrated it as ""a strong signal"" that ""there is tremendous room for foreign firms to expand in the Chinese market as long as they comply with local regulations."" Today, cloud computing is the latest area of contention between China and increasingly frustrated global companies. In late March, a group of more than 50 American lawmakers sent a letter to the Chinese ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, taking direct aim at China's restrictions on cloud computing. They wrote that current and draft regulations would force the transfer of valuable intellectual property to Chinese companies and effectively bar foreign cloud service providers ""from operating or competing fairly in China."" ""As we see it,"" the lawmakers wrote in the letter, which was viewed by The New York Times, ""these restrictions are fundamentally protectionist and anticompetitive."" Many of the lawmakers hail from states where two major cloud computing players, Amazon and Microsoft, have operations. Big global companies, which have long worked to keep from rocking the boat in China, are showing a bit more tolerance for making waves. The business groups that represent them have become more critical of China's industrial policies and ambitions. Businesses are increasingly complaining to friendly lawmakers, and those lawmakers have become more vocal on their behalf. Profiles in courage are still hard to find, as businesses fear Chinese retaliation if they complain directly or too loudly. For example, among the companies that would benefit most from any shift in China's cloud computing regulations, Microsoft, through a spokesman, declined to comment, and Amazon did not respond to requests for comment. The shift is also a gradual one, taking place in the years since the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, as the promise of a more open China faded. Still, people in business circles in China say the sense of disappointment in China's business prospects is growing. ""The enthusiasm is gone,"" said James McGregor, chairman of the greater China region for the consulting firm APCO Worldwide. ""Foreign businesses here used to be very excited about China and quite enthusiastic. Now, it's kind of a grind and a battle."" China remains a lucrative market for foreign-branded cars, iPhones, high-value engineering equipment and other costly items. Still, the growing frustration has muddled the corporate response to President Trump's tough anti-China rhetoric. ""There are companies, which in prior years have been strong supporters in Washington of the U.S.-China relationship, who are much quieter, and even waiting to see if a tougher approach might get more results with China,"" said Jake Parker, vice president for China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council. In one criticism on Tuesday, William Zarit, the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, expressed concern about President Trump's offer of trade concessions in exchange  for greater Chinese support in pressuring North Korea over its nuclear ambitions. ""If the United States gives concessions in the trade area so that we don't push as hard on leveling the playing field in all these different areas,"" Mr. Zarit said at a news conference in Beijing on Tuesday, ""I think it's a shame."" In public, businesses work hard to strike a sunny note. Last November, Jay Carney, Amazon's senior vice president for global corporate affairs and former White House spokesman, made no mention of his company's challenges there when speaking at China's World Internet Conference, according to a Chinese-language transcript of his remarks in state media. That reticence has bred frustration among some United States officials. In 2015, President Barack Obama told the Business Roundtable, a business group, regarding its complaints about China, ""Don't tell us on the side, 'We've got this problem, you need to look into it, but then — but leave our names out of it.'"" Still, executives say complaining can have an impact. Earlier that same year, Mr. Obama publicly criticized proposed Chinese rules that would require technology companies to turn over encryption keys to Chinese authorities. His administration had also expressed concern about Chinese draft regulations that would require China's financial sector buy only from ""secure and controllable"" suppliers, which trade groups said effectively meant Chinese companies. In both cases China relented, temporarily scrapping the banking laws and tempering the language in the antiterrorism law. Some intermediaries between business and China are pushing the government to do even more. ""Countries need to be persuaded. Words don't do it,"" said Max Baucus, a former United States ambassador to China, adding that the United States needs to use ""properly targeted"" leverage. ""I don't think the United States has done much of that,"" Mr. Baucus said. ""We need to have a more strategic economic approach to China."" He said Mr. Obama had raised the issue of American companies' unequal access to the Chinese market repeatedly with Beijing, but these appeals were ""insufficient."" Of all the sectors that China has set its sights on, tech has come under the most pressure. Services like Facebook and Twitter have long been blocked. Last November, China passed a cybersecurity law that would impose security checks on companies in industries like finance and communications and mandatory in-country data storage. In 2015, the American chip maker Qualcomm said it would pay $975 million for violating China's antimonopoly law. In 2016, Apple's iBooks Store and iTunes Movies were shut down in China, just six months after they were started there. In the same year, China said it would demand answers to new questions about Microsoft's business practices in the country. In cloud computing, China mandates that foreign companies work with a local partner, and the foreign companies are subject to equity restrictions that prevent them from owning a controlling stake in the cloud company. New draft regulations would make it even more difficult for them to get licenses for operation, block them from using their brands and logos to market their services and require them to ""terminate the transmission of"" and report any information posted or transmitted by users that ""violates relevant Chinese laws and regulations."" In China, the cloud computing market is estimated to be worth $20 billion by 2020, up from $1.5 billion in 2013, according to the consulting group Bain. Both Amazon and Microsoft operate in China through partnerships with local companies. In contrast, Aliyun, the cloud services unit of the Chinese web giant Alibaba, has its own data centers in the United States. For decades, Western companies have stood with China even during rocky moments in the Sino-American relationship. When Congress threatened to revoke China's most-favored-nation trading status in the 1990s because of concerns over human rights, the American Chamber of Commerce in China, or AmCham, headed to Washington to defend Beijing. More recently, the complaints from Western companies have gotten louder, as China's economic growth slows and unease grows about Beijing's failure to deliver on its promise to open markets for foreign companies as well as its Made in China 2025 plan to push for greater self-sufficiency in several industries. AmCham's 2016 survey of its members showed that 81 percent of its companies felt less welcome in China than before, up from 77 percent in 2015. The survey also showed that 31 percent of its members said the investment environment was deteriorating — the most pessimistic response AmCham has received since it started asking the question in 2011. ""China's heavy emphasis on building global champions through industrial policies is spiking new levels of concern about China's commitment to a mutually beneficial relationship,"" said Jeremie Waterman, senior director for the Greater China region for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Zarit, of AmCham, said a ""mixed bag"" of companies were unhappy about the investment climate in China, adding that ""they are afraid if anything is done, it will upset the apple cart."" Mr. Zarit, who led a delegation of eight former AmCham chairmen to meet with the Trump administration officials in Washington in February, said there was a new realization in Washington ""that this asymmetrical commercial relationship needs to be addressed in some way."" Mr. McGregor, who was on the trip, said they met Peter Navarro, a strident China critic in charge of trade and industrial policy, and Matthew Pottinger, Mr. Trump's top Asia policy maker. There, the delegation pushed the concept of reciprocity, meaning that if American companies are bound by restrictions in China, their Chinese counterparts should be subject to the same limits in the United States. Mr. McGregor said the idea got ""quite a bit of traction."" He added, ""Our attitude is China should be treated as an equal, and an equal needs reciprocity."""
0,2017-04-20," MANAUS, Brazil — The ""encontro das águas"" (meeting of waters) between the dark Negro River and the light-brown Solimões River is impressive. No wonder it's one of the main tourist attractions near the city of Manaus, capital of the state of Amazonas. For several miles, the two gigantic rivers flow side by side without mixing because of their difference in water composition, flow rate and density. (You can feel the variation of temperature by putting your hand in the water as the boat crosses the visually distinct line.) When the Negro and the Solimões finally merge, they form the Amazon, the world's largest river by discharge of water and one of the longest. When I recently went on a boat tour in the Janauari Ecological Reserve, near the meeting of waters, the boatman asked if I would also like to visit a family of ribeirinhos (riverside dwellers) who have a caiman, a sloth and a snake. ""You can take selfies with the animals, and later give them some gratification,"" he told me, euphemistically suggesting tips for the people who keep the animals. I vociferously declined. We resumed our navigation on the small motorboat through cool, peaceful igarapés (forest streams) leading to dazzling igapós (swampy, flooded forests). It seemed as if a dam had ruptured somewhere and the place was about to be submerged. Trees as high as buildings were half drowned by the river. The boatman became less talkative, as if I'd offended him by refusing his last offer. I enjoyed the scenery; there was no need to hug illegally domesticated sloths. Brazil still has a long way to go in the field of ecotourism. While in some places, as on the island of Fernando de Noronha, in the northeast, the rules concerning wildlife preservation are strict, in others there is less attention to long-term conservation and the ecological and social impact of tourism, often leading to the pure and simple exploitation of animals, as well as local people and their cultures. One of the most profitable tourist activities in the Amazon is swimming alongside pink dolphins or feeding them from a flutuante,  a private floating deck, often situated within a national park. Tourists regularly ride, restrain and harass the dolphins. Some even lift them out of the water for photographs. (Sometimes this is done with the encouragement of a tour guide.) There are accounts of people being accidentally bitten, and on one occasion, a man retaliated by punching the dolphin. A few years ago, a commission of federal agencies and research institutes issued local guidelines for the activity — including the amount of food to be offered and the requirement that only tour guides could feed the dolphins — but few people adhere to them. According to the owner of one flutuante, tourists must only avoid touching the dolphin's blowhole. (Please!) There's no federal legislation prohibiting feeding and touching the dolphins. As a result, their behavior has already changed: Many now survive on the frozen fish provided by tourism groups. They're also conditioned to stay close to the flutuantes and to humans. According to researchers, aggression is now common among the dolphins. Another popular activity in the Brazilian Amazon is caiman-spotting. In the evening, groups of people cruise the riverbanks, seeking out the huge nocturnal lizards that resemble crocodiles. It wouldn't be disruptive if so many guides didn't make a point of jumping in the water to grab the caimans and hold them up for photos. Amazon tour operators also offer recreational fishing of piranha, the omnivorous fish with sharp teeth and a ferocious reputation, and fake fishing of pirarucu, an ancient, giant fish that is at risk of extinction. The latter takes place in enclosed water tanks. In some ways, it's better because the pirarucus aren't injured by hooks, only mildly harassed by tourists trying to lift them out of the water. All of these activities take advantage of a lack of clear laws governing ecotourism and the use of natural resources. Tour operators promote packages by using questionable environmentalist phrases. One advertises ""ecological fishing""; another promises to have the federal environmental agency's authorization to take tourists swimming with dolphins. That's enough for most people visiting the Amazon — even if it's not true. The local people who keep wild animals as pets to lure tourists often claim that they release the animals at night and recapture them in the morning. Animals are not the only ones being abused. Another popular activity in Manaus is a visit to an indigenous community formed by five ethnic groups (Dessana, Tukana, Tuyuca, Wanana and Tatuia), which some tour operators deceitfully describe as a ""tribe."" Since the beginning of the last century, the indigenous people, who are perhaps Brazil's most marginalized and impoverished population, have migrated (or been expelled) from their original lands. (And I'm talking only about the small remnant left after the genocides that started with the arrival of the Portuguese.) They stage traditional music and dance performances for the guests of expensive jungle lodges. Indigenous people are often forced by their employers to meet tourists' stereotypes: the romantic, noble savage with slightly frightening rituals and no refrigerator. But that's not the worst part. Indigenous people didn't know that some of their bosses have traditional practices of their own: For five years, 34 Tariano people worked for a jungle lodge in exchange for only leftover food and a collective paycheck of $30 per performance. Others are not even paid and instead rely on selling handicrafts and jewelry to the visitors. There is no industry-standard agreement on the fair share of revenues for indigenous groups, and again, no federal regulation. It seems nothing will change until indigenous people themselves have the means to control all aspects of the experience they offer to tourists — and also reap the profits. On the other hand, many jungle lodges and tour operators are becoming more aware of these issues. Environmentally conscious tourists are also pushing for changes. The sustainable Uakari Lodge in the Mamirauá Reserve, for example, is run by members of the local community. So maybe there is some progress. In another jungle lodge called Anavilhanas, better attuned to an environmental conscience, I've enjoyed the most jaw-dropping tour of my trip: a simple kayak expedition through igarapés and igapós, stopping here and there to watch birds, monkeys and spiders at a distance. In the Amazon, there's no need to do more than that."
0,2017-04-21," Not to belabor the obvious, but when you're writing about streaming services, you discover a lot of them — and then find a whole lot more. I suppose you would learn that anyway, scrolling through offerings on Amazon Fire or Google Chromecast or a Roku, or just an app store. One could spend a month or more digging around Hero Talkies (""Watch Tamil Movies"") or InTube (""Watch Indian Films"") or Hindi Movies (no tagline, but pretty self-explanatory). You also learn that services come and go. If you click on an app for a service and get a message that it hasn't updated for the current operating system on your device, there's a good chance its extinction is imminent. Learning that a streaming site has up and disappeared is arguably more irritating than finding out a movie you've had on a service's watchlist has been deleted from the service. That said, much of the excitement of streaming is in the ability to get more of what you love (or think you might love). Acorn TV, an offshoot of Acorn Video, is not primarily a movie service. But a lot of movie lovers I know (not to mention my in-laws) swoon over it, because its mix of British and Australian TV series runs a gamut of genres (mysteries and comedies are particular strengths) and feature casts filled with familiar faces from films both Hollywood and not. (Incidentally, Sigourney Weaver had a cameo role on an episode of the cozy iTV series ""Doc Martin"" in 2015 — she approached the series's lead actor, Martin Clunes, while they were both on a British talk show and told him how much of a fan she was. The episode, ""Facta Non Verba,"" is on the Acorn service.) Better-than-decent adaptations of classic material like Agatha Christie's ""The Witness for the Prosecution"" are plentiful on Acorn. And the movies it does have are largely noteworthy. There's the 2002 BBC Film ""The Falklands Play,"" a fast-paced, quick-witted movie about the Falklands War in which the great British actress Patricia Hodge (""Betrayal"") portrays Margaret Thatcher, a performance that actually gives Meryl Streep's portrayal of the British prime minister in ""The Iron Lady,"" from 2011, a run for its money. ""44 Inch Chest,"" a 2009 adultery-and-kidnapping drama that's a sharp critique of male sexual jealousy, has a spectacular cast of indefatigable lads: Ray Winstone, Ian McShane, John Hurt, Tom Wilkinson, Stephen Dillane, Steven Berkoff. The service also features the great Australian director Gillian Armstrong's 1992 domestic drama, ""The Last Days of Chez Nous,"" with Miranda Otto, Kerry Fox and Bruno Ganz. The service is available as a website and an app, and on Roku, Amazon Fire and Chromecast, and costs $4.99 a month (a yearly subscription can be had for $49.99). In February, this column covered Brown Sugar, a service dedicated to Blaxploitation movies, most from the 1970s. Such films represent a pretty narrow segment of cinema by or about African-Americans. The Urban Movie Channel ($4.99 a month, $49.99 a year), created by Black Entertainment Television's founder, Robert L. Johnson, in late 2014, aspires to a wider range. Some solid, underappreciated films found on the site include ""Second Coming,"" a 2014 marital drama starring Idris Elba and Nadine Marshall, and ""The We and the I,"" from 2013, directed by Michel Gondry, an inventive story (set on a public bus) of Bronx high schoolers on their last day of classes. The Urban Movie Channel, or UMC, also features five features directed by the Ghanaian filmmaker Leila Djansi, including her most recent, ""Like Cotton Twines,"" from 2016. The drama is a sensitive, beautifully shot story about ""trokosi,"" described in the opening as ""a practice of religious slavery found in parts of Western Africa,"" in which a virgin girl is given up by a family whose member has been found guilty of a crime. The picture depicts an American teacher in Ghana (Jay Ellis of the HBO series ""Insecure"") attempting to rescue a student from being traded away by her father. Some aspects of the site are a little befuddling; a ""Classics"" section features both the 1977 horror picture ""The Hills Have Eyes"" (arguably a classic) and the 1986 affirmative-action blackface comedy ""Soul Man"" (absolutely not a classic). Just as it has much of everything, Amazon Video has a lot of horror, ranging from last year's critically acclaimed ""The Witch"" to the cult classic ""The House on Sorority Row"" (1983) to microbudget no-name pictures for which the streaming service provides an ostensible shot at finding an audience. Netflix has a little over 250 horror movies, many of them classics — ""The Legend of Hell House,"" from 1973, loomed large in my early-teen years, because it's really scary, and also because it touched off my lifelong crush on the actress Pamela Franklin. But some of them aren't horror movies at all: ""Scary Movie 2,"" from 2001, is a parody of horror movies; last year's ""Yoga Hosers"" is just an actual horror. Connoisseurs can find more conscientiously curated delights at Shudder ($4.99 per month, $49.99 per year) and Screambox ($4.99 per month, $35.88 per year). Shudder is big on exclusives, including the recent ""Prevenge,"" a thriller about a pregnant woman's killing spree, written, directed by and starring Alice Lowe, whose pregnancy in the film was authentic. The New York Times critic Jeanette Catsoulis called it ""a brilliantly conceived meditation on prepartum anxiety and extreme grief."" There are also international pictures, such as the 2003 French nouvelle-slasher flick ""High Tension"" and the 2007 Japanese period ghost story ""Kaidan,"" directed by Hideo Nakata, who made the 1998 classic ""Ringu."" Screambox is very full-throttle and fan-oriented, with not just horror fare but also documentaries celebrating the likes of the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise. The grind-house nostalgist in me was delighted to find two 1981 obscurities: the Italian filmmaker Lucio Fulci's mortifying gorefest ""The Beyond"" and ""The Nesting,"" an interesting novelty in which the New York sexploitation filmmaker Armand Weston tried to go mainstream, with mixed results. (It also happens to be the American '40s and '50s screen siren Gloria Grahame's final film, and one you are unlikely to see on TCM.) Screambox and Shudder are not exactly replete with transcendent masterpieces, and honestly, neither are Acorn and UMC. But even the most refined viewer knows that masterpieces are not always the point. Digging for something is half the fun."
0,2017-04-22," In just 10 years, the world's five largest companies by market capitalization have all changed, save for one: Microsoft. Exxon Mobil, General Electric, Citigroup and Shell Oil are out and Apple, Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Amazon and Facebook have taken their place. They're all tech companies, and each dominates its corner of the industry: Google has an 88 percent market share in search advertising, Facebook (and its subsidiaries Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger) owns 77 percent of mobile social traffic and Amazon has a 74 percent share in the e-book market. In classic economic terms, all three are monopolies. We have been transported back to the early 20th century, when arguments about ""the curse of bigness"" were advanced by President Woodrow Wilson's counselor, Louis Brandeis, before Wilson appointed him to the Supreme Court. Brandeis wanted to eliminate monopolies, because (in the words of his biographer Melvin Urofsky) ""in a democratic society the existence of large centers of private power is dangerous to the continuing vitality of a free people."" We need look no further than the conduct of the largest banks in the 2008 financial crisis or the role that Facebook and Google play in the ""fake news"" business to know that Brandeis was right. While Brandeis generally opposed regulation — which, he worried, inevitably led to the corruption of the regulator — and instead advocated breaking up ""bigness,"" he made an exception for ""natural"" monopolies, like telephone, water and power companies and railroads, where it made sense to have one or a few companies in control of an industry. Could it be that these companies — and Google in particular — have become natural monopolies by supplying an entire market's demand for a service, at a price lower than what would be offered by two competing firms? And if so, is it time to regulate them like public utilities? Consider a historical analogy: the early days of telecommunications. In 1895 a photograph of the business district of a large city might have shown 20 phone wires attached to most buildings. Each wire was owned by a different phone company, and none of them worked with the others. Without network effects, the networks themselves were almost useless. The solution was for a single company, American Telephone and Telegraph, to consolidate the industry by buying up all the small operators and creating a single network — a natural monopoly. The government permitted it, but then regulated this monopoly through the Federal Communications Commission. AT&T (also known as the Bell System) had its rates regulated, and was required to spend a fixed percentage of its profits on research and development. In 1925 AT&T set up Bell Labs as a separate subsidiary with the mandate to develop the next generation of communications technology, but also to do basic research in physics and other sciences. Over the next 50 years, the basics of the digital age — the transistor, the microchip, the solar cell, the microwave, the laser, cellular telephony — all came out of Bell Labs, along with eight Nobel Prizes. In a 1956 consent decree in which the Justice Department allowed AT&T to maintain its phone monopoly, the government extracted a huge concession: All past patents were licensed (to any American company) royalty-free, and all future patents were to be licensed for a small fee. These licenses led to the creation of Texas Instruments, Motorola, Fairchild Semiconductor and many other start-ups. True, the internet never had the same problems of interoperability. And Google's route to dominance is different from the Bell System's. Nevertheless it still has all of the characteristics of a public utility. We are going to have to decide fairly soon whether Google, Facebook and Amazon are the kinds of natural monopolies that need to be regulated, or whether we allow the status quo to continue, pretending that unfettered monoliths don't inflict damage on our privacy and democracy. It is impossible to deny that Facebook, Google and Amazon have stymied innovation on a broad scale. To begin with, the platforms of Google and Facebook are the point of access to all media for the majority of Americans. While profits at Google, Facebook and Amazon have soared, revenues in media businesses like newspaper publishing or the music business have, since 2001, fallen by 70 percent. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, newspaper publishers lost over half their employees between 2001 and 2016. Billions of dollars have been reallocated from creators of content to owners of monopoly platforms. All content creators dependent on advertising must negotiate with Google or Facebook as aggregator, the sole lifeline between themselves and the vast internet cloud. It's not just newspapers that are hurting. In 2015 two Obama economic advisers, Peter Orszag and Jason Furman, published a paper arguing that the rise in ""supernormal returns on capital"" at firms with limited competition is leading to a rise in economic inequality. The M.I.T. economists Scott Stern and Jorge Guzman explained that in the presence of these giant firms, ""it has become increasingly advantageous to be an incumbent, and less advantageous to be a new entrant."" There are a few obvious regulations to start with. Monopoly is made by acquisition — Google buying AdMob and DoubleClick, Facebook buying Instagram and WhatsApp, Amazon buying, to name just a few, Audible, Twitch, Zappos and Alexa. At a minimum, these companies should not be allowed to acquire other major firms, like Spotify or Snapchat. The second alternative is to regulate a company like Google as a public utility, requiring it to license out patents, for a nominal fee, for its search algorithms, advertising exchanges and other key innovations. The third alternative is to remove the ""safe harbor"" clause in the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which allows companies like Facebook and Google's YouTube to free ride on the content produced by others. The reason there are 40,000 Islamic State videos on YouTube, many with ads that yield revenue for those who posted them, is that YouTube does not have to take responsibility for the content on its network. Facebook, Google and Twitter claim that policing their networks would be too onerous. But that's preposterous: They already police their networks for pornography, and quite well. Removing the safe harbor provision would also force social networks to pay for the content posted on their sites. A simple example: One million downloads of a song on iTunes would yield the performer and his record label about $900,000. One million streams of that same song on YouTube would earn them about $900. I'm under no delusion that, with libertarian tech moguls like Peter Thiel in President Trump's inner circle, antitrust regulation of the internet monopolies will be a priority. Ultimately we may have to wait four years, at which time the monopolies will be so dominant that the only remedy will be to break them up. Force Google to sell DoubleClick. Force Facebook to sell WhatsApp and Instagram. Woodrow Wilson was right when he said in 1913, ""If monopoly persists, monopoly will always sit at the helm of the government."" We ignore his words at our peril."

1,2017-04-28," At the start of ""Catastrophe,"" Sharon (an Irish schoolteacher played by Sharon Horgan) and Rob (an American ad man played by Rob Delaney) meet in a London bar and proceed to have loads of sex, most of it unprotected. ""A terrible thing has happened,"" he tells her after learning that their six-night bacchanal has resulted in pregnancy. ""Let's make the best of it."" And with that, one of television's funniest, filthiest, most realistic takes on the sweet mess of coupledom and parenting was born. Ms. Horgan, 46, the Irish writer and actress, gave raw, ribald voice to the tumult of relationships. She even made nursing bras erotic. And she knows whence she writes: Now a mother of two daughters, she discovered she was pregnant six months into dating her husband, Jeremy Rainbird, an ad man at the time. Nope, it wasn't planned. Season 3 of ""Catastrophe,"" debuting Friday, April 28, on Amazon, finds the spouses exactly where they left off — with a receipt for a Plan B pill and a guilty conscience — and adds secret drinking, employment woes and financial struggles to the mire. ""We wanted to make their life hard, not just for the fun of watching people having to deal with that but also because that feels like reflective of what's happening in the world at the moment,"" said Ms. Horgan, who lives in London but was speaking by phone from Atlanta, where she is shooting a movie. ""Things are getting tougher, and people are having to dig deep."" These are edited excerpts from the conversation.  Carrie Fisher played Rob's blunt, manipulative mom, with whom Sharon shares a mutual aversion. How are you dealing with her death? Carrie is hugely in Episode 6. Even though it's just one episode, her presence is felt a lot more. It's fun writing a monstrous character, absolutely. But we wanted to get under the skin a little bit more. We had only just finished filming a couple of days when we got the news. And it was horrible, and we were absolutely devastated, and at the same time feeling madly lucky to have come into contact with this incredible presence. God, she knew how to deliver a line.  You and Rob met on Twitter, and then mined your real-life experiences for the show — agreeing not to make anything up. Is that still true? It's really not, if I'm honest. It was a good rule to have because if we know that what we're talking about is at least the truth in our world, then no one can call us out on it, you know? Yes, there's definitely still bits and bobs in there that we've taken from our own lives. But you can't stop those characters from becoming their own people.  Now you've got Sarah Jessica Parker delivering your lines in HBO's ""Divorce,"" which you created. It's a pretty joyous thing watching someone like her saying your words. That's a good buzz, sitting by the monitors watching Thomas Haden Church and Sarah Jessica Parker sparring. So that never stops being strange and wonderful.  Couples watch that sparring in squirmy silence. I've had that comment a lot, and I love the idea of couples watching my shows together. But I always felt that would be uncomfortable because things are said — and if people haven't said them, they've thought them.  Does it take different chops to write about the beginning of a relationship versus the end of one?  Oh gosh, you have to use your imagination more about the beginning of one. It's a very fun, sweet thing to write about two people falling in love, but I would say it comes more naturally to me to write about the dark side of it. Amy Gravitt, the head of comedy at HBO, said anyone who's been long-term married could write about how it feels to want a divorce. And it's a nice, vent-y thing. You can get things down on paper that you then don't have to say out loud to the person you love.  Rob says ""Catastrophe"" was written against the idea that long-term relationships are boring.  I do agree with him. Whether you're at a really high point or a sort of desperate low point, they're always going to be interesting. And really, if they're boring then shame on you.  The things that roll off your characters' tongues are deliriously smutty. Which one of you is innately filthier?  Well, there's definitely a lot of filth in there from me. But there's something about the fully formed filth that comes straight out of Rob that I need most. I've never seen the like of it. I have to work really hard to make sentences funny or find the ""thing"" in them. But he has this ability to open his mouth and just perfect dialogue comes out of it and 80 percent of it is vile [laughs] — and it goes straight in there."

Season 3 of ""Catastrophe,"" debuting Friday, April 28, on Amazon, finds the spouses exactly where they left off — with a receipt for a Plan B pill and a guilty conscience — and adds secret drinking, employment woes and financial struggles to the mire. ""We wanted to make their life hard, not just for the fun of watching people having to deal with that but also because that feels like reflective of what's happening in the world at the moment,"" said Ms. Horgan, who lives in London but was speaking by phone from Atlanta, where she is shooting a movie. ""Things are getting tougher, and people are having to dig deep."" These are edited excerpts from the conversation.  Carrie Fisher played Rob's blunt, manipulative mom, with whom Sharon shares a mutual aversion. How are you dealing with her death? Carrie is hugely in Episode 6. Even though it's just one episode, her presence is felt a lot more. It's fun writing a monstrous character, absolutely. But we wanted to get under the skin a little bit more. We had only just finished filming a couple of days when we got the news. And it was horrible, and we were absolutely devastated, and at the same time feeling madly lucky to have come into contact with this incredible presence. God, she knew how to deliver a line.  You and Rob met on Twitter, and then mined your real-life experiences for the show — agreeing not to make anything up. Is that still true? It's really not, if I'm honest. It was a good rule to have because if we know that what we're talking about is at least the truth in our world, then no one can call us out on it, you know? Yes, there's definitely still bits and bobs in there that we've taken from our own lives. But you can't stop those characters from becoming their own people.  Now you've got Sarah Jessica Parker delivering your lines in HBO's ""Divorce,"" which you created. It's a pretty joyous thing watching someone like her saying your words. That's a good buzz, sitting by the monitors watching Thomas Haden Church and Sarah Jessica Parker sparring. So that never stops being strange and wonderful.  Couples watch that sparring in squirmy silence. I've had that comment a lot, and I love the idea of couples watching my shows together. But I always felt that would be uncomfortable because things are said — and if people haven't said them, they've thought them.  Does it take different chops to write about the beginning of a relationship versus the end of one?  Oh gosh, you have to use your imagination more about the beginning of one. It's a very fun, sweet thing to write about two people falling in love, but I would say it comes more naturally to me to write about the dark side of it. Amy Gravitt, the head of comedy at HBO, said anyone who's been long-term married could write about how it feels to want a divorce. And it's a nice, vent-y thing. You can get things down on paper that you then don't have to say out loud to the person you love.  Rob says ""Catastrophe"" was written against the idea that long-term relationships are boring.  I do agree with him. Whether you're at a really high point or a sort of desperate low point, they're always going to be interesting. And really, if they're boring then shame on you.  The things that roll off your characters' tongues are deliriously smutty. Which one of you is innately filthier?  Well, there's definitely a lot of filth in there from me. But there's something about the fully formed filth that comes straight out of Rob that I need most. I've never seen the like of it. I have to work really hard to make sentences funny or find the ""thing"" in them. But he has this ability to open his mouth and just perfect dialogue comes out of it and 80 percent of it is vile [laughs] — and it goes straight in there."
4,2017-04-28," SEATTLE — The moneymaking machines at the core of Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, are notably different. But the respective kings of online retailing, software and internet search should all credit a relatively new line of business for lifting their financial results. In their quarterly earnings reports on Thursday, the three said cloud computing — through which they rent computing services and online access to software hosted in their data centers — was growing faster than their larger, older businesses. The impact of cloud computing was particularly noticeable at Amazon, far and away the leader in this still-young business. The profit Amazon can make on cloud-computing services is significantly bigger than in its retail sales, and that has helped turn the Seattle company from a consistent money-loser to a respectable moneymaker. For the first quarter, which ended March 31, Amazon said its total net income rose to $724 million, or $1.48 a share, from $513 million, or $1.07 a share, a year ago. The company said the $890 million in operating income from its cloud business, called Amazon Web Services or A.W.S., accounted for most of its overall profits. The worry, however, is that this cannot last forever, not with Microsoft and Google making big investments in their own cloud businesses while trying to undercut Amazon with lower prices. That has not happened — at least not yet. While A.W.S. revenue grew at a slower pace than in the past, it still rose a healthy 43 percent to $3.66 billion. The company's shares rose 1 percent in after-hours trading. ""There's always this moment when people think, 'Is the magic going to run out?'"" said James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research. ""It just hasn't panned out."" Microsoft — the No. 2 player in cloud computing — is steadily making the transition to that business, relying less and less on personal computer software, the company's mainstay for decades. Microsoft's Azure cloud hosting business grew by 93 percent from the year-earlier quarter. And the cloud version of its productivity software Office 365, sold to companies as an online service, grew by 45 percent. ""We're seeing continued strong demand for our commercial cloud-based services,"" Amy Hood, Microsoft's chief financial officer, said in an interview. For Alphabet, cloud efforts are catching on, though it trails far behind Amazon and Microsoft. Alphabet does not break out cloud revenues, but its ""Google other revenues"" segment, which includes the cloud, jumped 49 percent from the first quarter 2016. Ruth Porat, Alphabet's chief financial officer, said in a conference call with analysts that the Google cloud platform was one of the company's ""fastest-growing businesses,"" though she offered no details. Still, nearly all of Alphabet's business comes from advertising on the Google sites and services, which is still expanding despite tough competition from Facebook. First-quarter earnings increased to $7.73 a share while revenue jumped 22 percent to $24.75 billion. Average estimates from Thomson Reuters had been for $7.39 a share in earnings with revenue of $24.19 billion. The stock rose 4 percent in after-hours trading on the news. Alphabet's speculative ventures, including its home electronics division, Nest, and its autonomous car division, Waymo, are listed as ""other bets."" In the first quarter, the other-bets revenue rose 48 percent to $244 million. But losses increased 10 percent to $855 million. Google's total digital ad revenue has doubled since 2012. But for all the success that demonstrates, so much of advertising is becoming digital that Google's share of the online portion is actually slipping, according eMarketer. Five years ago, Google had a 35.9 percent share of global digital ad revenue, the data firm said. In 2016, it was 32.8 percent. The pots of money Alphabet is making could provide some consolation after major brands, including AT&T and Verizon, recently learned that their ads were appearing alongside inflammatory YouTube videos that promoted hate speech. Some advertisers vowed to drop YouTube, a Google property, until the problem was fixed. For its part, Microsoft's overall revenue rose 8 percent in the quarter, to $22.09 billion. That was enhanced by $975 million in revenue from LinkedIn, the professional networking site that Microsoft bought for $26 billion in a deal that closed in December. Microsoft's total operating revenue, which includes the deferred accounting for sales of its Windows 10 personal computer operating system, was higher, at $23.56 billion. That figure is the focus of Wall Street analysts, and the result was slightly below their consensus estimate of $23.62 billion, as compiled by Thomson Reuters. The modest shortfall was attributable to weaker-than-expected sales of Microsoft's Surface tablet computers during the quarter, which were down 26 percent. The company's share price fell about 1 percent in after-hours trading. Microsoft's net income rose 28 percent to $4.80 billion. Its operating earnings per share, which excludes one-time gains, increased 16 percent to 73 cents a share, ahead of the average analyst estimate of 70 cents a share. The company's results also added to evidence that the personal computer industry is stabilizing and even growing, at least among corporate customers. Sales of Windows operating systems to PC makers rose 5 percent in the quarter. The market research firm IDC recently reported that PC shipments grew slightly during the first quarter of 2017, the first gain in five years. Microsoft's Windows sales to PC makers are advancing by more than the rate of PC shipments, because of a shift to higher-priced versions as corporate customers upgrade to Windows 10. Overall revenue at Amazon rose 23 percent to $35.71 billion from $29.13 billion in the same period a year ago. The company's results were well ahead of the $1.12-a-share average earnings estimate and $35.3 billion revenue estimate of analysts compiled by Thomson Reuters. In a conference call, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, said the company was still heavily investing in the creation of new devices, video content and fulfillment centers to bring orders to customers more quickly. ""We're continuing to look for things customers love, can grow to be large and provide strong financial returns in the long run and can last for decades,"" he said."
5,2017-04-28," Netflix and Amazon have been nominated for hundreds of Emmys and Golden Globe awards in recent years, and that is a testament to both the quality of those companies and the transformation of television. But some of the credit is also due to ""net neutrality,"" the legal regime that nurtured and protected the open internet and streaming TV in the first place. Streaming, after all, is a cheaper and better form of television. For that reason, it is something the cable industry would not have allowed to thrive had it been left to its own devices. Fortunately, net neutrality rules prevented cable companies from killing or interfering with streaming television during its infancy. You might think it unwise, therefore, to question a policy that has yielded both lower prices and good television. But President Trump's chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai, on Wednesday announced plans to eliminate net neutrality (technically, make it ""voluntary"") despite its popularity, record of success and acceptance by most of the industry. His proposal is of dubious legality. But should it succeed, the only real winners will be the cable and phone industries, which will gain yet another way to raise prices for everyone. The proposal is the epitome of senseless government action and sharply out of step with Mr. Trump's populist mandate. Did Trump voters really vote for higher cable bills? In analyzing the attack on net neutrality, one looks in vain for the problem that needs to be fixed. Net neutrality refers to rules intended to ensure that broadband providers cannot block content or provide faster delivery to companies that pay more. The policy was put in place in the George W. Bush administration, where it enjoyed bipartisan support. In the years since, it has sheltered bloggers, nonprofit organizations like Wikipedia, smaller tech companies, TV and music streamers, and entrepreneurs from being throttled by providers like AT&T and Verizon that own the ""pipes."" The policy's contributions are not just cultural but also economic: Television has been revitalized, and waves of successful internet start-ups have returned America's high-tech industry to unquestioned global leadership. Net neutrality has been among the most effective economic policies of the 21st century. The idea of killing net neutrality certainly has nothing to do with voters or majority will. Instead, the proposal, like Mr. Pai's earlier gutting of privacy protections for cable customers, is at war with the economic populism that voters claimed they wanted and that Mr. Trump promised last year. Make no mistake: While killing net neutrality may be rolled out with specious promises of ""free video,"" there is nothing here for ordinary people. Lowering prices is just not something that cable or phone companies will do except under pressure. Instead, the repeal of net neutrality will simply create ways for cable and phone companies to tax the web and increase your broadband bill. Raise your hand if that sounds enticing. The officially stated reason for ending net neutrality is an obfuscation. Mr. Pai claims to support an open internet, but wants only ""voluntary"" compliance with net neutrality rules. But if it isn't broken, what is the F.C.C. trying to fix? The record suggests that the rules promote competition by imposing limits on ever more concentrated private power. Indeed, the basic insight behind net neutrality is not novel: For centuries there have been laws preventing the owners of infrastructure like bridges or ports from abusing their position and hurting the economy. Despite this history, the F.C.C. has decided on a new direction, the opposite of pragmatism. The more convincing explanations for this change are more straightforward — and darker — than Mr. Pai's. Much of Silicon Valley and Hollywood have supported both net neutrality and the Democratic Party, making an attack on the policy a kind of punishment. If Mr. Pai's reasoning sounds forced and unconvincing, it is because this proposal comes right from the swamp, and can be attractive only to those who have lived there long enough to no longer notice the stench. President Trump ran as an economic populist, but the announcement of Mr. Pai's plan could reveal what a true populist backlash looks like. Just a few years ago, more than four million people wrote to the F.C.C. to demand stronger controls on the cable industry, while those who took cable's side would have fit in the commission's lobby. The proposal to kill net neutrality is terrible economic policy and bad politics. It is starkly inconsistent with any populist mandate. There is a reason that net neutrality is called the third rail of internet politics, and Mr. Pai has now grabbed it."
0,2017-04-30," SEATTLE — If future anthropologists want to study the rubble of early-21st-century retail, a good place to start will be what Amazon.com did to apparel shopping in the few years before and after 2017. The outlook for physical retailers is grim, the sector roiled by store closings, layoffs and bankruptcies. This year, Amazon will surpass Macy's, which last year announced it would shut 100 stores, to become the largest seller of apparel in America, by several analysts' estimates. It is looking at ways to keep expanding, too. Amazon is exploring the possibility of selling custom-fit clothing, tailored to the more precise measurements of customers, and it has considered acquiring clothing manufacturers to further expand its presence in the category. If there are tipping points in retail — moments when shopping behavior swings decisively in one direction — there's a strong case to be made that apparel is reaching one now, with broad implications for jobs, malls and shopping districts. Those moments often occur around the time that online shopping reaches about 20 percent of total national retail spending in a category, the research firm L2 has concluded after studying the evolution of e-commerce. Online clothing and accessory shopping's share of retail hit 21 percent last year, according to estimates by Cowen and Company, a stock research firm. ""I do think this year is the year apparel e-commerce takes off,"" said Cooper Smith, an analyst at L2. Apparel has been something of an e-commerce laggard. In years gone by, buying clothing over the internet was only for the fearless, with most shoppers unwilling to take the risk that a dress or a pair of shoes would fit poorly or look terrible on them. It took time, but shopping habits for clothing are shifting profoundly. Amazon's solution was to improve clothing selection, pour money into photography to give internet shoppers a better representation of garments and offer free returns on most apparel so customers could order untroubled by the thought of sending items back. Pia Arthur, an Amazon spokeswoman, declined to comment for this article. Amazon is by far the biggest beneficiary of e-commerce growth, accounting for 43 cents of every dollar spent online in the nation last year, estimated Slice Intelligence, a company that measures online shopping. But there's little chance Amazon will come to have in apparel the crushing dominance it has established in, say, books, because of the way clothing sales are fragmented among so many retailers. Amazon accounts for half the country's consumer book market on a unit basis, according to the Codex Group, a book market research firm. Last year, the company's gross merchandise apparel sales — Amazon's direct sales of clothing plus the commission it collects on sales by independent merchants on its site — were $22 billion, or 6.6 percent of the market, Cowen estimated. By 2021, the firm has forecast, Amazon will account for just over 16 percent of apparel sales. ""We look at it as winner take most,"" said John Blackledge, an analyst at Cowen. ""That's their game."" Still, Amazon faces hurdles in its apparel business. Some apparel makers have been frustrated by the prevalence of counterfeit versions of their products on Amazon, peddled by independent merchants. Last year, Birkenstock, the sandal maker, stopped selling its footwear directly to Amazon, becoming one of the biggest brands to cease doing business with the retailer. Since then, Birkenstock has warmed somewhat to Amazon, allowing authorized independent sellers to continue to sell its products on the site. ""We have seen improvements on the Amazon marketplace addressing our core issues of unauthorized sellers and counterfeit goods,"" said Dania Shiblaq, a spokeswoman for Birkenstock USA, adding that the company still does not directly sell to Amazon. The idea of buying clothing without first trying it on is still a deal breaker for many shoppers, even with the security of free returns. Amazon executives look at such hurdles as ""friction,"" which they are constantly seeking to eliminate. ""Anytime you make something simpler and lower friction, you get more of it,"" Jeffrey P. Bezos, the company's chief executive and founder, wrote in a letter to shareholders in 2007, after the company made getting a book nearly instantaneous with the original Kindle. One idea Amazon is considering to lubricate apparel shopping: custom-fit clothing. The company's apparel team is exploring the possibility of offering ""on-demand"" clothing that would be made only after a customer submitted an order, using the customer's precise measurements, according to a person briefed on the discussions who asked for anonymity because they were confidential. The group has described its intentions as ""five-day custom"" in an internal presentation, the source said. In April, Amazon received a patent for on-demand apparel manufacturing, though that is no guarantee it will pursue the plan. If it works, the plan could make shoppers happier by delivering clothing that looks better on them, while also addressing the ruinous consequences that returns can have on the profits of internet apparel retailers. It's not uncommon for shoppers to order three sizes of a shirt or dress and send back two. About 35 percent of all apparel orders are returned, said Stefan Weitz, chief product and strategy officer for Radial, a company that runs e-commerce operations for other brands and retailers. ""That has huge impact on customer experience and satisfaction and also on that retailer's P and L,"" said Drew Green, chief executive of Indochino, an internet retailer of custom-fit suits, referring to profit and loss statements. Mr. Green said fewer than 1 percent of Indochino's orders were returned. Amazon could use its growing private-label apparel business as the springboard for any custom-fit clothing it starts. It already sells cashmere sweaters, dresses and men's suits under brands like Buttoned Down, Lark & Ro and Paris Sunday. Amazon has also considered acquisitions to increase its apparel manufacturing expertise. According to the person with knowledge of discussions within the company's apparel group, Amazon has considered buying Indochino. This person also said it had mulled a bid for American Apparel during its bankruptcy auction, which Reuters first reported in January. (A Canadian apparel company, Gildan Activewear, won the auction.) Mr. Green declined to comment about whether Amazon had made an offer for Indochino. There's still the matter of how Amazon would get a customer's precise measurements. Indochino's answer has been to coach customers to do the measurements themselves, and to open showrooms where Indochino employees can do the measurements for them. (Its 13th store opened on Friday.) Amazon has developed a camera and scanning software designed to automatically determine customers' measurements and upload them to their accounts, according to the person familiar with Amazon's apparel talks, who saw an early prototype of the device. The source said the device resembled a camera product that Amazon announced last week, Echo Look, the latest in a line of gadgets powered by the company's Alexa intelligent assistant. Amazon has described the device as a kind of digital fashion adviser, allowing people to upload photographs of themselves to get style recommendations through a combination of software algorithms and human fashion specialists. The company declined to say whether the device would be updated in the future to capture clothing sizes for customers."
1,2017-04-30," The process starts when customers submit online orders to the retailer for shirts and other articles of clothing, accessories, bedding, curtains and towels. The patterns, printed onto rolls of fabric or other material, are arranged to reduce scrap.  A ""cut engine"" then carves out the various pattern pieces, while cameras analyze them to make sure they aren't being distorted in the process. A robotic arm with a mechanical gripper places all the pieces into a tote on a conveyor belt.  The conveyor belt delivers the totes to a sewing station, where ""an attendant and/or automated sewing machine"" stitches the item together. The items are then examined at a quality control station, packed up and shipped to customers."

0,2017-05-02," In the aisles of the American supermarket, hierarchies arise and collapse with the velocity of soap-opera drama. The produce section is especially cutthroat; here, because novel products are so rare, it's the stories that must change to entice consumers. Back in the 1970s, the Chinese gooseberry went global — cultivated in New Zealand and shipped to the world — after being rechristened as the friendlier kiwi. Just a few years ago, kale was king, rehabbed as a luxury green after decades as a garnish and a Southern standby. Similarly, quinoa, long a staple crop in the Andes, has lately become a Western fixture, an ostensibly more primal alternative to rice. The latest entrant to this contest is Brazilian açaí, a purplish, antioxidant-rich stone fruit — though most call it a berry — foraged from trees in the Amazon River basin. On an April Monday in Sherman Oaks, Calif., the Harvest Bar was packed with adults in athleisure, eating puréed açaí from bowls the size of flowerpots. The restaurant is a fast-casual ""superfood cafe,"" one in a growing class of health-food restaurants doing brisk trade in the açaí-bowl business, selling heaps of the puréed berries topped with diced fruit and other sweets. ""The blend is like an ice cream,"" the owner, Aric Haut, explained. ""But healthy."" More than 5,000 miles to the south, harvesters in the Amazon basin of Brazil climb palm trees to pick the wild-growing fruit. What lies between these two distant parties is the latest unspooling of the food-fad plot — a supply chain driven by remarkable health claims, with money exchanged at every step along the way. In the Amazon River basin, açaí — pronounced ""ah-sah-EE"" — has been eaten since at least the dawn of written history. The fruit, until the 1970s, was constrained to just this region, where local ribeirinhos, or ""river people,"" plucked it from trees and ate it as part of nearly every meal. As a weak jungle economy pushed ribeirinhos into cities, their gradual migration formed a distribution network. At first, they sold açaí from makeshift roadside carts. By the '80s, they were shipping it to Rio and São Paulo, where it gained a reputation as prime fuel for jiu-jitsu. High in omega fats and low in carbohydrates and sugar, its sweet and earthy flesh is filling yet light. By the '90s, Brazil had an açaí-bar scene. As the berry gained status, its price began to rise. If the superfood plot were a bit more predetermined, you might expect açaí to go the way of quinoa. When the protein-rich grain spread to supermarket aisles and started to appear in fast-casual restaurants, it moved out of reach for the Bolivian farmers whose dependence on the grain made it famous in the first place. The story with açaí is not so simple. Here, surprising parties become heroes and scoundrels as the coveted berry changes hands in different ways. Global consumption has further increased demand, but because of the high value of good vibes, some superfood exporters have an incentive to hew to best practices. Sambazon, the leading exporter of the berry, has emerged as an unlikely steward of the crop. The company's chairman, Ryan Black, first tasted the fruit in the late '90s, back when it was mostly unknown in America. Black, a jock with a stoner's lilt, was a former football captain at the University of Colorado, Boulder. He has since cornered the açaí export market, in part by paying a guaranteed minimum price to harvesters, protecting wages from dipping too low. According to a sustainability study, workers along Sambazon's vertical supply chain can earn up to three times what the average Brazilian takes home. Beyond taking pains to demonstrate that its harvest is sustainable, the company has begun funding local schools for agro-forestry education and even devoting some of its fair-trade funds to health and child-care services in the region. The domestic Brazilian açaí market, by contrast, is structured as a game of pass the baton. The berry's rise to fame in tandem with internal migration yielded a fluid and decentralized network: The guy who picks the fruit sells to the guy with the boat, who sells to the guy with the bigger boat, who sells to the guy with a stall in the market, who sells to the guy with the processing shop, who turns the fruit into frozen purée and ships it to distributors in Rio and São Paulo. According to studies of the açaí economy, these stages of the chain are often disconnected, their workers unaware and uninvested in the steps that come before. This poses a risk to long-term sustainability. Should some ambitious operator upstream decide it's easier and cheaper to simply cut açaí trees down, the ecosystem could collapse. But for now, this nascent economy offers low barriers to entry in a region much in need of opportunity. Because of this, the açaí boom hasn't created an easy narrative of exploitation. For urban consumers in cities like Belém, according to Black, the cost of açaí has risen sharply. To others, like the ribeirinhos, the trend has meant a sudden influx of cash, bringing capital (and flat screens) to isolated towns. For those who learn sustainable techniques, the boom could mean a long-term source of income for the region; for others driven to make a quick buck, the boom might remain just that — a boom. As açaí mania has progressed, even multinationals have latched on to the trend, with both Coca-Cola and Pepsi now peddling açaí-tinged drinks. The berry, for now, remains harvested in the wild, but some who study sustainability in the region worry that increased demand for the crop might ultimately strain wild harvesting operations and result in large-scale açaí plantations. The same vibes that drive growth in the region might also destroy the same wholesome ethic that made açaí appealing to Americans in the first place. For us, it might not matter; we'll probably have found a new superfood by then."
0,2017-05-03," Net neutrality — the concept that no online content should receive preferential treatment — has long been viewed as something of an equalizer between telecom companies and internet companies. So when Ajit Pai, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said last week that he planned to loosen the rules governing net neutrality, the reaction was predictable. Critics of the move said telecom companies would be helped by the change and internet companies would be hurt by it, because they might have to pay more to deliver online content. But the New York Times technology columnist Farhad Manjoo views it somewhat differently. The biggest internet companies won't necessarily be hurt by any dismantling of net neutrality, he writes. Instead, doing away with net neutrality will only help cement the power of internet behemoths like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google. How's that? Without net neutrality rules, the deepest-pocketed internet companies — and some of them have very deep pockets indeed — could simply pay to have their content digitally delivered in the fastest lanes, Farhad says. They could easily outspend start-ups and small rivals to do so. And that way, their hegemonies not only would persist but also could potentially grow. In other words, if Mr. Pai gets his way, the internet will be even less fair than it used to be. ""The giants seem likely to keep getting bigger,"" Farhad writes. ""If we give them a chance to buy up every fast lane online, we'll be removing another check on their untamed power."""
0,2017-05-04," With their strange and puzzling relationship to numbers, the Pirahã, a small group of hunter-gatherers who live deep in the Amazon rain forest, seem like some fantastical creation of Jorge Luis Borges. Their relationship to numbers is: They don't have one. The language they speak has no precise number words, not even ""one"" or ""two."" It also lacks what linguists call grammatical number — terms like ""both,"" from which you can tell the speaker is referring to two of something. While the Pirahã do have some number-like phrases, they are ballpark expressions, like ""a few"" in English. More curious still, these linguistic limitations track behavioral limitations. The Pirahã cannot, with any consistency, precisely differentiate quantities larger than 3. If you show them a lineup of seven spools of thread and ask them to replicate it, they struggle, creating lineups of five or six or eight. They can tell that a large group of spools is bigger than a much smaller group — psychologists call that an approximate number sense — but their exact number sense conks out after 3. Were there four Beatles or five? The Pirahã couldn't rightly say. One of the lessons of NUMBERS AND THE MAKING OF US: Counting and the Course of Human Cultures (Harvard University, $27.95), a fascinating book by the anthropologist Caleb Everett, is that to exoticize the Pirahã (say, by likening them to Borges characters) is to misunderstand the insight they represent. The Pirahã are not fundamentally unlike other human beings. On the contrary, they show us what human beings are like in isolation from a cultural innovation we take for granted: the written and spoken symbols of quantities known as numbers. Everett stresses that numbers are not concepts we arrive at ""naturally and natively."" Like a flint arrowhead or the wheel, they are tools people invented a long time ago, and we know how to use them only because we find ourselves in a society in which that knowledge has been preserved and transmitted. Without these symbols, we, like the Pirahã, could not ""see"" divisions between most quantities. With them, as Everett tells it, our ancestors learned to count, and thereby ""radically transformed the human condition,"" making possible such number-dependent developments as complex agriculture. You needn't venture into the wild to find illustrations of our crude inborn number sense. Perhaps the most convincing evidence, Everett notes, comes from cognitive research on children. Even shortly after birth, prelinguistic infants are capable of identifying discrepancies between the quantities 1, 2 and 3, as well as recognizing disparities between large and small groups of things. But well after they start walking and talking, children still find it hard to learn what 4 and 5 are, and how they are related. This rudimentary feel for quantities — precision with small ones, blurry approximation thereafter — can be observed not only in young children and isolated peoples like the Pirahã but also in nonhuman primates like chimps and some nonprimate animals like rats. It appears to be our genetic endowment, an apparatus good enough to have helped us survive the rigors of natural selection. It may also underlie certain widespread features of the world's languages, such as the fact that they permit distinctions between one thing and many (""car"" versus ""cars"") and allow for the identification of two things (""both"") or three (though not in English), but in no known cases do they give you the means to refer to precise quantities of 4 or more — unless, of course, you use a number. If numbers don't come to us naturally, where do they come from? When children learn numbers, Everett emphasizes, it can't be a process of learning names for concepts they already have. It must be a process of ""concepting"" those names: Words like ""four"" and ""five"" and ""six"" function as place holders for ideas children eventually grasp. With instruction and practice, they start with concepts they know intuitively (such as that 2 is one more than 1) and learn to construct others by analogy (such as that 8 is one more than 7). Much as a fishing rod is a tool we use to acquire fish, number words are tools we use to acquire number concepts. This account seems to present a paradox: How did we ever manage to create names for quantities if we weren't able to recognize quantities without names for them? This consideration has led many scholars to conclude, contrary to Everett, that we must be biologically ""wired"" for numbers. Everett's response is speculative: While human beings typically cannot discriminate an exact quantity such as 4 without number words, he suggests that some people — people we might call inventors — must have occasionally hit upon the idea that the quantity of 4 could be referred to precisely. Many thousands of years ago, by giving names to these otherwise fleeting ideas, such inventors made their insights available to others, creating tools to be borrowed, shared and developed further. Sharing mathematics is consequential business. Just as the transmission of numbers made possible the development of agriculture, so too the transmission of more sophisticated mathematics, many thousands of years later, made possible the scientific revolution, industrialization and modern medicine. In his jaunty book FINDING FIBONACCI: The Quest to Rediscover the Forgotten Mathematical Genius Who Changed the World (Princeton University, $29.95), Keith Devlin sets out to tell the elusive story of the 13th-century mathematician Leonardo of Pisa. As the author of the first extensive text on modern practical arithmetic in the West, Leonardo has some claim to being the pre-eminent sharer of mathematical tools of his age — and thus, in Devlin's estimation, ""one of the most influential men of all time."" In 1202, Leonardo, also known as Leonardo Fibonacci, published ""The Book of Calculation."" While the book didn't contain any original mathematical discoveries, it did offer elegant methods for solving arithmetical problems, often using examples involving money — investing, converting or otherwise allocating it. The impact of these examples, which underscored the application of arithmetical methods to business and trade, was considerable. In the early 2000s, a historian of mathematics demonstrated that ""The Book of Calculation"" was a main driver of the financial revolution that arose in medieval Tuscany soon after its publication. Around the same time, a professor of finance showed that the book's innovative treatment of financial decision making facilitated the development of complex financial tools over the next few hundred years. Devlin, a mathematician who has proved a few ""largely unremarkable theorems"" while distinguishing himself as a popular expositor of mathematics, has more than a little sympathy for Fibonacci. No doubt he was also relieved to learn that although Leonardo's name is attached to the famous set of numbers known as the Fibonacci sequence, Leonardo did not discover them, but merely included a brief discussion of them in his book. The Fibonacci sequence — a progression of numbers whose first two terms are 1 and 1, and each subsequent term of which is the sum of the two preceding terms (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and so on) — seems to have first appeared more than a millennium earlier in a book by a Sanskrit grammarian. Another popular myth about the Fibonacci sequence of which Devlin disabuses his reader is that it has ""deep connections to human aesthetics."" So what is interesting and true about the Fibonacci sequence? For an answer to that question, you can consult THE MATHEMATICS LOVER'S COMPANION: Masterpieces for Everyone (Yale University, $28), by the mathematician Edward Scheinerman. It includes the Fibonacci sequence as one of 23 masterworks whose analysis Scheinerman presents with rigor and accessibility (assuming you have some taste for formal systems) for nonmathematicians. Are you interested in the properties of the sums of the terms of the Fibonacci sequence? Of their ratios? Of their relation to the so-called golden mean? Or perhaps you'd rather learn a bit more about that weird tribe in the Amazon?"
0,2017-05-05," Each week, the Open Thread newsletter will offer a look from across The New York Times at the forces that shape the dress codes we share, with Vanessa Friedman as your personal shopper. The latest newsletter appears here. To receive it in your inbox, register here. Hello and happy almost-weekend. Do you know what time it is? Not time to make the doughnuts (I'll leave that to my colleague, food editor Sam Sifton). It's winter pre-collection time. But wait, you say. I thought spring had finally arrived. What on earth is that? Good question: I ask it myself all the time, and I have been doing this for decades. Pre-collection shows, which take place sporadically in New York and Europe in May-July and November-January, are actually the debuts of the largest collections any designer makes. They are in stores the longest, and they make up the bulk of sales. They are, in other words, the clothes most consumers (that would be you) actually buy. But because designers tend to see pre-collections as clothes people wear, as opposed to clothes they use to make a giant statement, they are conflicted about how to show them. Some have giant shows in glamorous far-flung destinations like Tokyo (Louis Vuitton at the end of this month). Some have little presentations in their showrooms with a model or two. Some skip the models altogether. There is no coordinated time frame for the season, and no central organization. There's not even a widely accepted name. (""Cruise,"" ""resort"" and ""pre-spring"" are actually synonyms.) It's Lord of the Fashion Flies! But you are about to start seeing the results. The next round of pre-collections started this week in Paris with a Chanel show that featured an enormous set of ruins modeled, in part, on the Parthenon. ""Rather than going to Greece, the fashion house brought Greece to Paris,"" wrote Alexander Fury. ""King Midas has nothing on Kaiser Karl."" But before you have to start thinking about what to wear in November (Gah! Brain freeze!), take a moment to think about what the two dueling French presidential candidates have worn as they prepare for Sunday's historic election. Or pause to consider the possibility that Amazon may finally become a serious player in the apparel industry, and change how you shop for clothes. That should give you something to discuss over your morning coffee or evening martini. Or even your green juice at the gym. For other conversational ideas, read on. Every week on Open Thread, Vanessa will answer a reader's fashion-related question, which you can send to her anytime via email or Twitter. Q: ""O.K., I'm a 64-year-old white male who has to ask his wife if what I'm wearing is acceptable whenever we go out. Still, I have a serious fashion question: Why oh why should anyone care what celebrities, or models, or fashion designers or anyone else thinks about what he or she should wear? ""This has always seemed to me about the silliest thing one could possibly be concerned about, but I'm willing to learn."" — BRIAN ZACK, M.D. A: I bet lots of people agree with this. But here's the thing: Remember that adage, ""Dress like the boss""? Or ""Dress for the job you want""? Well, this is simply another variation on that. We look, whether consciously or subconsciously, to those in power — our parents, or teachers, or role models, or just plain old models — for cues about how to present our selves, just as we look to them for value systems, knowledge, what have you. And thanks to social media, their examples are now pretty much everywhere (see Selena Gomez's 119 million Instagram followers). Granted, these days the balance of attention has shifted toward the glitzy and the glammy in a distorted way, but the basic rationale remains the same. (Personally, I tend to take my dressing cues from Kamala Harris rather than Rihanna, but I'm still taking them.) Guy Trebay has a really good story about how late-night TV hosts are modeling the best way to wear a suit, which I also recommend. As for designers, their job (at least when they are doing it) is to observe the culture that surrounds them and how identity is evolving, and then translate that into cloth. To, effectively, give you a new way to be yourself. But whatever and whomever you are looking at, don't forget it's up to you to decide whether you buy what they are selling. — VANESSA FRIEDMAN"
1,2017-05-05," LONDON — E-commerce is revolutionizing the world of retail. Online sales in the United States have grown by an average of $40 billion a year over the past three years, posing an existential threat to brick-and-mortar shopping. This year, Amazon is set to overtake Macy's, which plans to close 100 stores, as America's biggest apparel seller. Yet at least one sector seems firmly resistant to the convenience of the click: the buying and selling of fine art. Last year, worldwide online sales of art and collectibles were estimated at $3.75 billion, an increase of 15 percent over 2015, according to the fifth annual Online Art Trade Report, published last month by the insurer Hiscox. This is steady growth, but hardly the revolution promised by auction houses. The total represents well below 10 percent of a global market that recent reports have valued at $45 billion or higher. ""It's still tiny,"" Robert Read, head of art and private clients at Hiscox, said of the online art market. ""The market is crowded and fractured, and still has to deal with trust issues."" The Hiscox report, compiled by the market analysts ArtTactic based on responses from 758 art buyers and 42 company managers, found 59 businesses actively engaged in either selling art directly online or using some kind of web-based platform to facilitate such sales. It said no dominant player had yet emerged from the competitive shuffle. Established auction houses with physical showrooms have made a comeback over e-commerce specialists. Hiscox's 2017 ranking of the top 25 online art sales platforms, based on the sample's usage and satisfaction rates, was led for the second year by Christie's, a 250-year-old auction house that values online sales more as a marketing tool than as a revenue stream. Sotheby's, its 273-year-old rival, was ranked second. Christie's 118 online-only sales and internet bidding at its 449 live auctions in 2016 raised 161 million pounds, or about $208 million at current rates, about 4 percent of the company's £4 billion in art and collectible sales. More important for the auction house, online bidding generated a hefty 33 percent of the customers that were added to its database that year, according to Christie's. ""The single biggest reason for our online sales is to bring in buyers to Christie's,"" said Marc Sands, the company's chief marketing officer. ""Live auctions have a certain barrier. It's not the case with online. It's brought in a whole new vista of audiences."" Sotheby's, bruised by failed partnerships with Amazon and eBay in the early 2000s, is now playing catch-up. The company held 16 online-only auctions last year. These, together with online purchases at live auctions, generated $155 million, according to Sotheby's. Hiscox said, however, that the level of existing art buyers converting to online sales remained static for the third consecutive year. ""Hesitant art buyers remain unconvinced about buying art online,"" its report said. ""Lack of physical inspection remains the key challenge."" That might be the case for higher-priced unique works, which represent an immovable mountain of value in the art market, but, as the Hiscox report notes, online bidding is making an impact lower on the price chain, particularly at auctions of prints. One such print sale, Phillips's Editions auction in New York last month, raised $6.2 million, the most ever by the company in this category. Eighty-eight percent of the lots found buyers, with 35 percent going to online purchasers. More than half of those internet buyers were using Phillips's own online channel, with the remainder bidding through intermediaries such as Artsy, Invaluable and eBay, said Andy Foster, the auction house's deputy chief of staff. ""The job of the digital area is to get every other possible bidder internationally,"" Mr. Foster said, adding that $100,000 remained a ceiling for many online buyers. But one-off lots are increasingly passing that barrier. At the Phillips sale, for example, Picasso's masterful 1962 linocut ""Still Life with Glass Under the Lamp"" sold to an online bidder for $250,000. And on April 20, at the end of the two-week bidding window for an online sale of Asian, ancient and ethnographic works held by iGavel Auctions, a Chinese cloisonné enamel vase sold for $812,500. Offered on behalf of Quinn's Auctions in Virginia, the vase had been cataloged as being 18th or 19th century and was estimated at $400 to $600. ""It turned out to be a sleeper,"" said Lark Mason, an Asian art specialist who is president and founder of the iGavel and Lark Mason Associates auction companies. Mr. Mason added that a Western client had bought the vase, now thought to be a rare 15th-century example, without seeing it in person against competition from 14 other bidders. Mr. Mason, like the Hiscox report, sees online auctioneering as the key battleground for e-commerce in 2017, with the major auction houses facing down dozens of online companies that are now going sink or swim in a smaller pool of available business. ""We're seeing a drop in demand and the market is dependent on regional auctions at the lower end,"" Mr. Mason said. ""But because of the open access of the internet, now everybody is competing against everybody else."" Artsy, with its depth of editorial content and network of commercial partnerships with major auction houses, dealers and art fairs, is No. 3 in the Hiscox rankings, followed by 1stdibs and Artnet. Definitive sales figures, let alone profits, are hard to find in the online sector. But the 16-year-old 1stdibs, which provides an online sales platform for dealers, is bringing in more than $150 million per year, according to the report. Ambitious newcomers are still entering the crowded market. The Swiss-based website Auction AfterSale has come up with the idea of providing an online sales portal for the thousands of lots that do not find buyers at auctions. The site, which opened last month, was founded by Jean-Baptiste Fabre, a former auction house specialist in French 18th-century furniture. Auction AfterSale allows visitors to make offers based on the low estimates of freshly failed items in 90 collecting areas, priced mainly in the range of 1,000 euros to 100,000 euros, or about $1,100 to $110,000. ""It's a huge market,"" said Mr. Fabre, who estimated that as much as $8 billion worth of art could have been left unsold at auction last year. ""But it's not the most glorious. The auction houses don't look at it. I do."" The site displays items with a catalog description and recommended price, but does not reveal the identity of the auction house. When a sale is negotiated, Auction AfterSale splits the buyer's fee with the house. At least, that is the business plan. Mr. Fabre said he had approached more than 500 auction houses worldwide to collaborate on after-sales. So far, no major auction house has agreed. Over the next year or so we will discover if Auction AfterSale was one of the fitter ideas in the Darwinian online art market. In January, the recently merged online auctioneer Auctionata Paddle8 filed for bankruptcy protection. Auctionata, which is based in Berlin, has not survived. Paddle8, with headquarters in New York, has reopened as an independent company through a management buyback. ""I'm surprised there hasn't been more consolidation. I know it's going to happen,"" said Mr. Read, Hiscox's head of art and private clients, who wrote the foreword to the insurer's report. ""But in the art world, there will always be a bricks-and-mortar market."""
2,2017-05-05," Twenty years ago, ""I Love Dick"" — Chris Kraus's novel chronicling her one-sided obsession with a cultural critic named Dick and how she staked out her own identity as a writer through a wild series of letters to him — was published to little notice. Since then, it has grown into a feminist cult classic. The book anticipated an era of popular female autofiction — from Emily Gould's ""And the Heart Says Whatever"" to Sheila Heti's ""How Should a Person Be?"" — and with a cheeky title that feels made to be Instagrammed, it has taken on new resonance as a text for women in the social media age. This month, it will continue its pop cultural rise with a television adaptation by another feminist auteur. ""I Love Dick"" the TV series — created by the ""Transparent"" writer and director Jill Soloway with the playwright Sarah Gubbins, starring Kathryn Hahn as Chris and Kevin Bacon as Dick, and crafted by an all-female writers room — begins streaming on Amazon on Friday, May 12. Recently, I joined Ms. Kraus at her hotel room in New York, where she had come for a reading with an old friend, the poet Eileen Myles. Jill Soloway dialed in from Los Angeles, where filming on the fourth season of ""Transparent"" was underway. They talked about the female gaze, the experience of writing about one's self and why Ms. Myles is at the center of everything. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.  How did you first encounter each other's work? CHRIS KRAUS I saw ""Transparent,"" like everybody else. I thought it was wonderful. JILL SOLOWAY Strangely and sadly, I had no idea who Chris Kraus was until I read about her in The New Yorker. In the '90s, I must have been in the wrong place to know about the book. I almost felt like she was kept from us — like there was a conspiracy keeping me from knowing about her. How was there a book called ""I Love Dick"" that I didn't know about?  How did you two actually meet? SOLOWAY Eileen Myles is the secret alchemy here. When I was writing the character of Leslie [a beguiling and commanding lesbian poet, played by Cherry Jones] on ""Transparent,"" I was researching Eileen. Then I got the book, and the introduction was by Eileen, so that was crazy. Here was this person who I had a kind of crush on, but I hadn't met, but I knew I was going to meet, and then here she was introducing this book. She was wrapping her arms around the material and helping me understand how important it was. By a month or so later, Eileen and I were dating, and I asked her to introduce us. KRAUS She called me up and said, ""Do you want to have coffee?"" I thought you had this hit TV show, and you were exercising that prerogative of ""Oh, there's something interesting, I think I'd like to meet them."" We had a pleasant conversation, and then a few weeks later I got a call: ""How would you like 'I Love Dick' to be a TV show?""  What was your relationship like during the making of the show? Chris is credited as a consultant. KRAUS I'm more of a spiritual godmother. I wasn't involved in a very hands-on way. I never wanted to be. If an adaptation doesn't change the material in some way, it's not a success. SOLOWAY For us, ""I Love Dick"" is not just about adapting the book, but about trying to record the feeling of what happens when you read the book. Chris is so comfortable with her desire and her creativity that it shocks everyone who reads it into their own artistic awakening.  KRAUS One of my favorite things you did with the material is the episode where the three women in the ensemble write their own letters to Dick. It adapts the phenomenon of the book rather than the book itself. ""I Love Dick"" is one of the most ""selfie"" books in contemporary fiction. A lot of people who have read the book have said it's given them a certain freedom. The book has turned me into a motivational speaker in some way. You captured that.  Let's talk about Dick. The character in the book is so much a creation of Chris's mind. How do you go about casting a real person in that role? SOLOWAY It was just one of those things: Of course it's Kevin Bacon. He's an icon who means something to people in a way that Kevin himself probably doesn't understand. He's Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon. He's Dick, too.  Jill, you've said that the show is about the female gaze. What does that look like to you? SOLOWAY I don't necessarily know what the female gaze is, but I'm in the process of excavating it, just like a lot of women are. It starts with an attempt to recognize how much being seen stops us from being. I've also been thinking about defining a Heroine's Journey as a story that moves in spirals or circles, instead of the Hero's Journey, which is more of an arc. That's why this book was so exciting to me: Chris was falling backward and spiraling down heroically. I felt like I was able to finally read the trajectory of someone who wasn't succeeding on male terms. Were any man to look at this woman, they would say, ""She's crazy, she's a slut, I don't like her,"" but when a woman reads the book, she says, ""She's my hero, I am her, and the more they don't like me, the further this thing goes."" KRAUS The key moment in the pilot is when you're looking, from Chris's point of view, at the two men at the table snickering and colluding. That's such a radical and awakening moment. Women see that all the time, and it's so rarely depicted. SOLOWAY That's everything. That's how it feels to be the object of male corroboration. It's the Donald Trump and Billy Bush moment on the bus.  You were both profiled in The New Yorker in stories with similar themes: women who worked on the fringes for many years who have achieved great recognition only recently. What is it about this moment that has allowed for that to happen? KRAUS On a macro level, this is a terrible moment, but in some ways it's a very good moment. There are more women in creative fields who are active and visible than ever. There's a multiplicity of women doing interesting and visible work, and there's a lot more receptivity toward it. And the word spreads faster. When the book came out in 1997, I was speaking to an art-world audience, and there weren't many chances for it to move into the larger culture the way it has now, because of women blogging about the book and Instagramming the cover. SOLOWAY I have this annoying bug in my ear about my career that says, ""I was writing pilots about unlikable women for 15 years, but it took a man in a lead role for me to actually get any attention."" Obviously, he's a man playing a trans woman, but I don't think America understood that at first. But I think Lena Dunham did something gigantic by having a successful, unlikable woman at the center of ""Girls."" At least for white women, there was a sea change. One year before that, I would go to meetings where people would look at me with a straight face and say, ""You must have a root-for-able, heterosexual man at the center of your show if you want us to make it.""  You both have made work that's based in your own lives and on people around you. How has that changed your relationships? KRAUS Not at all, for me. I can't think of anyone who has not wanted to be friends with me for fear of being written about. But maybe you better not marry me, or else you'll get written about. SOLOWAY In some ways, Eileen was my Dick. And ""Transparent"" was my ""I Love Dick."" Many people in my life were synthesized into stories. I had to have the same kinds of conversations the fictional Chris had with the fictional Dick: ""This is not about you. Oh, I know your name is in it. It's not about you. It's about me."" It became a way for me to process the experience of making autobiographical work.  The show traded California for Marfa, Tex. Why? SOLOWAY That was another Eileen Myles piece of magic. She was living in Marfa, and we were still together when I was making the pilot. She said, ""You should shoot in Marfa."" My thought was, ""This is a crazy way to get me to come visit you.""  And it worked. SOLOWAY It totally worked! Fifteen minutes after Eileen made the suggestion, I realized how brilliant it was. The town is a place where masculinity had been running rampant. We took Chris Kraus and threw her in.  Jill, when you started making ""I Love Dick,"" ""Transparent"" was already a huge success. But you still had to go through the Amazon pilot process before getting the full season greenlit. They didn't make Woody Allen do that. Why did you have to jump through that hoop again?  SOLOWAY One word: patriarchy."
0,2017-05-06," You had never seen or heard of them before. And then suddenly they were everywhere. Whirring on your children's fingers. Driving their teachers bonkers. Driving you bonkers. Trending on Twitter. Sold out on Amazon. Herein, a primer on how the cheapo gizmo of the moment spiraled out of control: ONE ""HORRIBLE"" SUMMER, IN 1993 Unable to play with her daughter Sara, then 7, because of her myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disorder that causes muscle weakness, a Florida inventor named Catherine Hettinger invents a prototype of a fidget spinner as way to bond with her daughter, Ms. Hettinger recently told The Guardian. 1997 Visions of Rubik's Cubes, Koosh balls and Pet Rocks presumably dancing in her head, Ms. Hettinger goes to Washington to secure a patent for the toy. 1997-2015 All in all, a pretty slow couple of decades on the fidget-spinner front. After Hasbro declines to market Ms. Hettinger's invention, the patent expires in 2005. Small manufacturers, meanwhile, begin to market endless variations of the spinner, often as a therapeutic aid for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety or autism, to help them focus and relieve stress. Most are three-prong or snowflake-shape devices made of plastic or metal and fitted with ball bearings, allowing them to spin between users' fingertips. No one so far has explained why this is considered fun. SEPTEMBER 2016 While spinners are nothing more than a Detroit-based soul act from the early 1970s to most people, early-adopter entrepreneurs are beginning to sense a potential fidget-based gold rush. In Denver, two 20-something brothers, Mark and Matthew McLachlan, seek to raise $15,000 on Kickstarter for their ""Fidget Cube."" They end up attracting more than $6 million. ""We checked out what tools were available for fidgeting,"" the founders told Adweek, ""and we couldn't find any that we'd feel truly comfortable using in a professional setting."" DEC. 23, 2016 The hype train begins chugging. Just in time for Christmas, Forbes declares fidget spinners ""the must-have office toy for 2017,"" observing that stressed-out executives whose fingers are ""a raw, bloody mess"" because of ""boredom-induced nail-biting"" are trading their stress balls for fidget spinners like MD Engineering's Torqbars, priced from $129.99 to $259.99 but which begin selling for as much as $400 on eBay, because of their limited availability. It's like a new iPhone for those who do not actually require their gadgets to do anything. MARCH 22 YouTube, along with Reddit, is filling up with videos on fidget-spinner reviews, hacks, and tricks. ""Fidget spinning is a lifestyle,"" David King, an Australian tech blogger, says in his video, ""Fidget Spinner Tricks With a Professional Fidgeter,"" which has been viewed more than three million times. He was kidding. We think. MARCH 31 Lest you be confused, the fidget spinner is not just a child's toy for grown-ups. Children love them too, according to The Boston Globe, as fidget spinners have apparently supplanted recent fads like bottle-flipping and homemade slime as a teacher nuisance. ""When we got back from Christmas break, a couple of kids had them, then a couple more kids had them, and then they were definitely en vogue,"" one New Hampshire schoolteacher said. APRIL 10 It's not a party until the celebrities show up. InStyle recounts how Gwyneth Paltrow's son, Moses, recently celebrated his 11th birthday by being given ""a set of cool new fidget spinners before spending a sun-filled day at Legoland in California with friends and his proud mama."" APRIL 20 As school districts around the country ban these focus tools for being too, yes, distracting, a New York schoolteacher named Cristina Bolusi Zawacki takes to Working Mother to denounce fidget-spinners: ""Let's stop with the flowery euphemisms. It's a toy and I hate it. I actually have a visceral reaction when they emerge from a pencil case or pocket, like a sadistic version of Pavlov's bell experiment."" MAY 2 The backlash is in full effect. In an article called ""Are Fidget Spinners a Scam?"" Britain's Daily Mail quotes Dr. Mark Rapport, the director of the Children's Learning Clinic at the University of Central Florida's department of psychology, as saying that ""using a spinnerlike gadget is more likely to serve as a distraction than a benefit for individuals with A.D.H.D."" MAY 4 What backlash? Fidget-spinners occupy 17 of Amazon's 20 best-sellers in the Toys & Games category (and fidget cubes account for two more). A Google Trends chart of the search term looks like a hockey stick. MAY 5 Ms. Hettinger still has not seen a dime from any of this, at least since the 1990s, when she sold a few thousand spinners at fairs in Florida, she told Money. But that could change. Ms. Hettinger, now 62, has started her own Kickstarter campaign for a ""classic"" spinner."
0,2017-05-08," There is a growing drumbeat that the five leading tech behemoths have turned into dangerous monopolies that stifle innovation and harm consumers. Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook — what the tech columnist Farhad Manjoo calls the Frightful Five — have a combined market capitalization of more than $2.7 trillion and are an increasing part of everyday life. They are each assembling enormous pools of data about their users — which they use not just to sell more targeted advertising, but to improve and personalize their services, increasing their network advantage against smaller players. But while these firms are increasingly formidable and deserve scrutiny, over all their market power appears less durable than infrastructure-based monopolies of previous generations. As David Evans and Richard Schmalensee note in ""Matchmakers,"" dominant digital platforms are ""likely to be more transient than economists and pundits once thought."" In most tech markets, multiple players reach viable scale. And consumers often have an incentive to switch between competing services, based on convenience and price. Not only are these titans vulnerable to regular existential threats (recall Microsoft's unbreakable hegemony over PC software that didn't translate to mobile computing), they are also all converging — therefore competing — with one another. All five of these firms are in a broad race to dominate consumers' digital lives at home and at work. They all offer a suite of connected services — for instance, some combination of music, video and communication services — which increasingly overlap with one another. They are each expanding their market opportunity, but also straying out of their zones of competitive advantage into areas of increasing rivalry. This convergence in strategy, products and tactics is a powerful inoculation to anticompetitive outcomes.  Many of the recent monopoly arguments rely upon narrowly defining markets to make a rhetorical case, as well as hypothetical consumer harm. Ben Thompson, who writes the tech newsletter Stratechery, for instance, argued recently that Facebook has a monopoly in the ""content provider market."" It is easy to see how commentators get worked up about Facebook, given it controls several large, overlapping networks including WhatsApp and Instagram. But the claim that it has a monopoly over content providers, is risible. Even if Facebook were the singular acquirer of content, that would make it a monopsonist, not a monopolist. This distinction is critical because a monopsonist — who is the only buyer for a given set of suppliers — uses its power to squeeze input prices (like the sole employer in a town, keeping wages low). Whereas a monopolist uses its power to raise consumer prices. Facebook's importance as a major traffic source for many content sites is self-evident, but publishers still go directly to consumers and use other significant intermediaries — notably Google, which is owned by Alphabet. The woes of the publishing industry are because of the impact of the internet, not Facebook. Mr. Thompson unconvincingly asserts that Facebook's power over publishers produces a ""dead weight loss"" (where monopoly taxation leads to a waste of resources) and that consumers are afflicted by Facebook's stifling of innovation. But Facebook users are not suffering under the yoke of oppressive masters. On the contrary, they are benefiting from a period of intense competition. The same applies when it comes to entertainment. Netflix isn't one of the big five, but it enjoyed a brief honeymoon as a monopoly after it crushed Blockbuster. But just a few years later, it faces intense competition around the globe. While the Netflix chief executive, Reed Hastings, may say that ""sleep"" is his company's major rival, in reality, Amazon and Alphabet — not to mention Hulu, HBO and myriad local players — prevent Netflix from running away with the market. Commentators often conflate ubiquity, or narrow market dominance, with a broad-based monopoly. Amazon regularly gets tarred with this brush. About 80 million people now take a Prime subscription bundle, according to industry estimates. Weaving together multiple products and services under one compelling offering gives Amazon a formidable advantage to which its rivals are scrambling to react. But even so, Amazon is so far only exhibiting signs of market dominance in the market for books. And even there, as Paul Krugman has noted, it looks more like a monopsonist exerting market power than a monopolist exploiting consumers. For diapers, dog food, videos, music, cloud-computing services, voice technology and so forth — it faces extreme competition from other tech companies, not to mention traditional retailers. Walmart alone is still four times its size in retail (albeit much smaller online). In video and music, Amazon is an order of magnitude smaller than Netflix and Spotify. And in cloud computing, Amazon faces serious competition from Alphabet and Microsoft and others, which offer similar services, also on a grand scale. It is blindingly obvious that traditional retailers are suffering. But holding Amazon responsible for the decline in brick-and-mortar retail is like blaming Craigslist for the death of print classifieds. The natural gravitational pull of the internet caused those problems, not one company. While almost all of the hand-wringing about tech monopolies is overblown. The player that perhaps warrants the closest scrutiny today is Alphabet, and in particular its Google search engine. Google's overwhelming dominance of search (it has 90 percent market share in United States search revenue) is particularly critical given search's centrality to the web's commercial ecosystem. Google, however, has not been sensitive enough in handling its power — especially with its history of bringing the fight to smaller, narrowly focused rivals, like Yelp in the local reviews market. Its strategy in certain verticals resembles the old survival maxim: First, eat what the monkey eats, then eat the monkey. There is no denying that the leading tech companies are riding high. The recent signal by the Federal Communications Commission that it intends to ditch net neutrality has fueled concerns that the Frightful Five will further stifle competition from start-ups. While these firms have all been public advocates for net neutrality (they don't want to be taxed by Comcast or Verizon), they won't have any trouble affording whatever ""tax"" the carriers might impose. Instead, the companies at some risk of real disadvantage will be start-ups we haven't heard of yet. However, as consumers continue to migrate to mobile, neutrality matters less. Mobile carriers already use ""zero rating"" (whereby certain services don't count toward data caps) to advantage their own content (or that of their partners). And unlike in fixed broadband, consumers are afforded some protection by the real choice they have in mobile carriers. Plainly there is no cause to be Pollyannaish. It's sensible to be wary of acquisitions and potential overreach. And there may be specific cases that cross the line and should be reined in. Over all though, the kind of competition we see among Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft tends to sort things out naturally and brutally. The only surefire winner from this battle is the consumer."
0,2017-05-09," SAN FRANCISCO — With an Amazon Echo speaker today, you can talk to Alexa, the virtual assistant that powers the device, and ask it to play songs, order diapers and even turn on your air-conditioner. Now Amazon wants you to do more than talk to Alexa. It also wants you to call friends and family through Echo speakers — and it is even putting a screen on one of the devices so you can see them while talking to them. On Tuesday, Amazon introduced the latest model in its expanding family of Echo products, the Echo Show, which has a seven-inch touch screen and a video camera that let people place video or voice calls to each other over a Wi-Fi connection. In a move that could have broader impact, Amazon also said it would release a free software update this week that brings voice-calling features to existing Echo devices. The changes, which thrust Amazon into the crowded landscape of internet communications tools like Microsoft's Skype, Apple's FaceTime and Google's Hangouts, underline the company's ambitions for the Echo. In a way, the new communications functions turn the speaker into something like a traditional landline telephone, which many people have given up in favor of smartphones. Rather than pulling a phone out of their pockets, people will be able to simply command their Echoes to call someone. The goal is to make the Echo, and Alexa, even more of a fixture inside people's homes — a system that can help you shop online, control your home's temperature and, now, converse. And it allows Amazon to once again chart a path ahead of others with how it is using the speaker. ""Amazon now has a huge first-mover advantage,"" said Werner Goertz, an analyst at Gartner, the technology research firm. Amazon said it planned to release the Echo Show in late June, with a starting price of about $230 for a single device, or two for $360. The Echo was an oddity when Amazon released it in late 2014, a time when smartphones and touch-screen devices seemed to be elbowing other devices out of the way. But since then, the products have remained top sellers on Amazon's site, though the company would not say how many it has sold. Rivals have scrambled to come up with their own smart home devices that have voice controls at their core. Google released its Home device last year. On Monday, Harman International, the audio gear maker owned by Samsung, announced the release of its own smart speaker, Invoke, powered by Microsoft's Cortana intelligent assistant. Still, many have struggled to catch up to Amazon. The company is projected to have 70 percent of the voice-enabled speaker market in the United States this year, according to an eMarketer study published on Monday. Google Home is estimated to have about 24 percent of the market, with the rest split between smaller players. According to eMarketer, more than 35 million Americans will use a voice-activated assistant device at least once a month this year, more than double the number from last year. All of this is a turnabout for Amazon from a few years ago. At the time, the company was floundering in the market for devices, battered by the failure of a smartphone that never made a dent against Apple's iPhone and Samsung's family of devices. Amazon's breakthrough came when it figured out a way to package technologies like voice recognition and artificial intelligence in a device for the home that could be commanded without having to look at a screen. Dave Limp, Amazon's senior vice president for devices, said its Echo products were part of a category of ""ambient computing"" — devices that can be controlled in a communal setting, like inside a home or a car, primarily with voice. ""You shouldn't be compelled to go and interact with the screen — you should be able to do it with your voice,"" Mr. Limp said in a product briefing. ""It's very different from traditional computing as we've known it for the last three decades."" Yet there are obvious limitations to devices that rely entirely on voice interfaces, which the Echo Show is intended to address. The screen on the device adds the ability to stream videos, show lyrics while playing music, and display calendar events and voice-dictated text messages to other Echo users. Displaying movie showtimes and other lists on a screen, as the Echo Show can, is more convenient for users than Alexa reading them. ""I think Echo Show fits very well in the kitchen,"" said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies. The catch is that for now, the only people an Echo user can call are other Echo owners, or anyone with an Alexa app on an iPhone or Android device. Mr. Limp said there was no technical limitation that would prevent Amazon from connecting a phone number to an Echo device that would allow them to be reached by people with telephones. But he declined to say whether Amazon intended to offer that capability. Because the Echo can be used only as a speakerphone, it also is not likely to be used for private calls when others are present in a room. Ms. Milanesi said she was skeptical about whether Echo could supplant smartphones for voice calling. ""We're so used to using our phones,"" she said. ""Finding a reason to use Alexa for that is harder. They need to give you something more specific and interesting and different than other platforms we're engaged with."""
1,2017-05-09," Alexa, please phone home. These are no longer just idle words. Alexa, the voice-triggered smart assistant from Amazon that powers the company's Echo speakers, will soon be able to do just that. On Tuesday, Amazon unveiled the newest addition to its Echo devices — the Echo Show — which come with a seven-inch touch screen and the ability to make voice and video calls using a Wi-Fi connection. Yes, Amazon is adding communications capabilities to the Echo so that it acts more or less like a landline phone in your home, write Brian X. Chen and Nick Wingfield, technology reporters for The New York Times. This is interesting for several reasons. Amazon largely missed out on the smartphone boom several years ago, but it has now found a way into the communications game with the Echo and Alexa. The addition also continues Amazon's first-mover advantage with the Echo by giving it new capabilities ahead of rivals. All of which may help cement Echo's place in our homes. So perhaps the real question now is this: Alexa, just how far will Amazon take this?"
0,2017-05-10," Slowly, gradually, before we even had time to realize it, the Frightful Five tech companies — Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent of Google — became essential and inescapable. That was the view of the New York Times technology columnist Farhad Manjoo when he asked last week on Twitter how people would manage if they were forced to give up some of these companies' products and services. The question prompted all sorts of uncomfortable squirming as people considered — really considered — what they would do. Which ones would they ditch if they had to? The answers did not come easily. In his column this week, Farhad explains the order in which he would dump the companies. Spoiler alert: For Farhad, the last one to go would be Amazon, the e-commerce company that he now uses to order items of all kinds — and whose hardware, like the Amazon Echo speaker, he also uses for many household questions and tasks. Farhad also takes advantage of the handyman service that the company offers users who need assistance. To help you figure out how deeply embedded the Frightful Five are in your life, Farhad came up with a quiz to identify which of the companies you might shed first. Spend a minute with it, and see if the result surprises you."
1,2017-05-10," SEATTLE — A year ago, when Amazon let a homeless shelter for families move into a former motel it owned, it was viewed as a nice but fleeting gesture. The motel was on a chunk of downtown property where Amazon planned to eventually erect yet another set of sparkling buildings to meet its insatiable need for office space in this city, where it has come to embody both the region's economic boom and its struggles with affordability. The hotel would be torn down and the shelter kicked out when that time came. Instead, Amazon has decided to let the shelter stay. In an unusual arrangement, the company has agreed to give the shelter, Mary's Place, a permanent home inside one of the new office buildings for which it will break ground in the fall. Amazon will give roughly half of the six-story building to the shelter, providing it with 47,000 square feet of space with private rooms that can hold 65 families, or about 220 people and their pets. The facility, expected to open in early 2020, will have its own entrance and elevators. ""I see it as this huge gift because everywhere we go, we end up leaving,"" said Marty Hartman, the executive director of Mary's Place, which runs seven transitional shelters around the Seattle area meant to house families until they can find permanent homes. ""You come in and become a fabric of the neighborhood you're in, and then you say goodbye. That's a hard thing for a lot of people to do."" In an interview at the current Mary's Place site owned by Amazon, which was bustling with families returning to the shelter for the evening, John Schoettler, Amazon's vice president for global real estate and facilities, said the company would spend ""tens of millions of dollars"" on the design and construction of the shelter's portion of the building. Amazon will pay the utilities for Mary's Place, which will occupy the space rent free, although the organization will continue to pay its own staff. Mr. Schoettler said Amazon originally allowed the shelter to stay in the motel because of the severity of Seattle's homelessness crisis, which had prompted the city's mayor to declare a state of emergency in 2015. Mr. Schoettler said Amazon was impressed by Mary's Place, and he described its plan to give the shelter a permanent home as an investment in the neighborhood. In San Francisco, Google, Salesforce.com and others have funded a campaign to find permanent housing for homeless people. But Nan Roman, president of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, a nonprofit advocacy group in Washington, D.C., said she was unaware of any other private corporation integrating a homeless shelter into its building. ""Too often, homelessness gets pushed to the other side of the tracks,"" Ms. Roman said. ""Keeping them as neighbors is nice."" In Seattle, the plan could also help burnish Amazon's image, which has taken some hits. It has been targeted by anti-gentrification activists, and its high-pressure work culture was the subject of a New York Times investigation two years ago. Amazon has also been bashed for being disengaged from civic life relative to local stalwarts known for their philanthropic giving, like Boeing, Microsoft and Starbucks. More recently, that has begun to change, with gifts like Amazon's $10 million donation for the construction of a new computer science building at the University of Washington. ""Its reputation in Seattle has certainly suffered,"" said Alan Durning, executive director of Sightline Institute, a nonprofit research organization focused on the Pacific Northwest. ""Doing things like this may be in its enlightened self-interest, right on site for the world to see."" Amazon is also a different company from just a few years ago. It now has 30,000 employees in the city, making it Seattle's largest private employer, and it has transformed large swaths of the downtown and South Lake Union neighborhoods. While the company not long ago consistently lost money, Amazon now regularly turns a profit thanks to its lucrative cloud-computing business, giving it more financial breathing room for activities like philanthropy. Seattle's homelessness crisis has also worsened, with tent encampments sprouting up by the side of freeways, under bridges and in parks. The surrounding King County area had the third-largest homeless population in the country last year, after New York and Los Angeles, according to an annual report to Congress by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. More than 10,000 people are homeless in the area, with more than 4,000 of them living on the streets, the Seattle/King County Coalition on Homelessness estimated in a report last year. One of the residents of Mary's Place, Patricia Abbott, a mother of four, said she became homeless after losing her job when her son was injured and she needed to tend to his medical needs. She has been at the facility for six months and learned of Amazon's support for the organization at the shelter's Christmas party when she received an American Girl doll for one of her children from the company. ""There's people out there who really do care,"" Ms. Abbott said. Mr. Schoettler said he proposed the plan to let the shelter remain at a meeting in January of Amazon's senior leadership, including Jeff Bezos, the company's chief executive. Mr. Schoettler made the invitation to Ms. Hartman of Mary's Place last week, she said in an interview on Monday. ""It's permanent,"" Mr. Schoettler said, pausing for a moment before adding, ""Until homelessness is solved."""
2,2017-05-10," PARIS — Ian Rogers, chief digital officer of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, sat in his sunlit office on Avenue Montaigne last month, alongside a large cactus with a mélange of Pucci-pattern skateboards and black and white rock band photographs arrayed on the walls behind him. Using a tattooed finger, he punched in a pass code that would unlock access to ""Babylon"": the code name for the top secret project he has been working on since his arrival 18 months ago at the world's largest luxury group. ""We believe we are on the cusp of revealing something very exciting,"" Mr. Rogers, 44, said in hushed tones. The ""we"" was the project's 60 employees, many of whom have been hired from the Paris technology sector and who are hidden far from the corporate headquarters in new offices in the 15th Arrondissement. Mr. Rogers rolled up the sleeves of his navy V-neck sweater and added, ""I guess it's time to see if the customers think so, too."" He was referring to the imminent unveiling of LVMH's high-stakes foray into multibrand luxury e-commerce. Rumors of a shopping platform that would fall under the branding umbrella of Le Bon Marché, LVMH's upmarket department store, have swirled for months. Now 24 Sèvres, a boutique shopping website and mobile app named after the Paris street that Le Bon Marché is on, goes live in under a month. It is a gamble that has divided many of the fashion industry's power players. On the one hand, 24 Sèvres will be yet another contender in an already crowded sector, where established rivals such as Yoox Net-a-Porter, FarFetch and MatchesFashion.com have long been jostling for the world's wealthiest consumers. Anticlimactic performances by more recent entrants like Style.com, Condé Nast's multimillion-dollar digital boutique, indicated that even the most reputable names in fashion can struggle when arriving late to the game. A successful entry by LVMH, however, could shake up everything. Controlled by the French billionaire Bernard Arnault, the conglomerate owns 70 luxury brands, including Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton, Bulgari, Fendi and Givenchy. LVMH wields hefty firepower thanks to its financial footing, a monopoly over so many labels (including where and how they can be sold) and hundreds of bricks and mortar stores worldwide. ""Le Bon Marche is already a multibrand physical retailer; moving that store online is a clear and natural next step,"" said Luca Solca, a luxury goods analyst with Exane BNP Paribas. ""Of course, the natural advantage for LVMH is that they can get so many brands to play ball straight away, because the businesses belong to them. Easy, no?"" Not so fast. LVMH has previously faltered in the multibrand luxury space. The website eLuxury, closed in 2009, was a rare and high-profile misstep. What makes the group think it can succeed now where it has failed before? ""One word: Timing,"" Mr. Rogers said. Other people, though, might say that he is the answer. Born in Goshen, Ind., Mr. Rogers has a résumé rarely seen in haute luxury. He is a computer science graduate and onetime roadie for the Beastie Boys who first became a father at 17 (that daughter, now 26, is finishing her Ph.D. in genetics in the United States). He spent the early part of his career as president of new media for the band's record label Grand Royal. (""I wouldn't be anywhere without those guys,"" he said of the Beastie Boys, looking affectionately to their picture up on the office wall). Then came a stint at digital music group Nullsoft, a period at the helm of Yahoo Music and later the position of chief executive of Beats Music, which he held during its $3 billion takeover by Apple in 2014 before becoming head of iTunes Radio. But, he said: ""I was ready to move on from music because it felt like a solved problem. The main players are now established. The space has gone from science fiction to mainstream, from an industry in denial to an industry in free-fall to an industry in growth. ""And I just had this feeling about retail, that it would be the next frontier to really change, where the real winners are yet to be determined. Then LVMH approached me with this opportunity. And I realized if I really believed that, there could be no place better to go.""  Since his arrival in Paris from California, where he lived for 20 years, Mr. Rogers has made steps to adapt to life in the French capital. He takes his 10-year-old daughter climbing at the MurMur Escalade, and has sampled as many great restaurants as possible, citing Miznon, Le 21 and Le Bon Georges as highlights. He has skated the mini-ramp at République, done graffiti at the Bercy skatepark and trained for numerous marathons. Of his work at the company, Bernard Arnault has been ""incredibly supportive,"" Mr. Rogers said. He added that Mr. Arnault's digitally attuned son, Alexandre, 25, had been his ""key ally."" ""A lot of the stuff we've been working on, I just wouldn't have been able to do without Alex,"" Mr. Rogers said, emphasizing that his responsibilities extend far beyond the introduction of 24 Sèvres, where day-to-day operations are run by its chief executive, Eric Goguey. He also oversees the LVMH brands' e-commerce strategies, customer data management upgrades, the building of the online wholesale business in perfumes and spirits and LVMH's China digital strategy. ""There is a lot on our plate right now,"" Mr. Rogers said. ""And Alex, outside of his full-time day job, is very switched on as to where this business needs to go."" The younger Mr. Arnault is the chief executive of Rimowa, a luggage brand owned by LVMH. Still, there is no question that this e-commerce endeavor is extensive and eagerly anticipated. Mr. Rogers said LVMH had considered every branding possibility for 24 Sèvres, which will initially stock only woman's wear, but settled on maintaining a connection to Le Bon Marché because of its 160-year history as a pioneer in catalog sales. ""I find it interesting that the Parisian perspective on fashion has been missing from the e-commerce landscape until now,"" he said. ""In my view it is a conspicuous absence and a huge market gap that we intend to fill."" He declined to reveal the exact cost of this investment for LVMH to date other than to say that it was relatively ""modest — a brick-by-brick, start-up style approach."" He added that 24 Sèvres is also the name of the current loyalty program run by the department store, with legions of existing members. That program will also now be shared with users of the website and app. In many ways 24 Sèvres shares characteristics with its more established rivals, including fast delivery times to scores of international locations; chatbots or stylists-on-demand; glossy packaging, complete with Eiffel Tower cutout pop-ups and love notes from Paris; and an efficient checkout process. Luxury e-commerce has become about the price of the consumer's time, Mr. Rogers said, leading to an increasingly competitive field in terms of service across the retail spectrum. But there are differences, too. ""The move toward social media platforms like Instagram and Snapchat comes hand-in-hand with the rise of the internet as a more visual medium and of mobile domination,"" Mr. Rogers said, his hand on ""Louis Vuitton Windows,"" a suitcase-size Assouline tome by the Louis Vuitton visual image director, Faye McLeod, that sits as a touchstone in the middle of his office (Ms. McLeod has been heavily involved in the creative direction of 24 Sèvres). ""Increasingly consumers want pictures over words,"" he said. As a result, he added, ""if you look at our site, we lean far further toward visually-led merchandising than the more editorial skew of our competitors."" Tiny exquisite illustrations by Hadrien Durand-Baïssas and colorful tongue-in-cheek GIFs are scattered throughout the site. Each product category header is a monochrome photograph of artists' models contorted into various sculptural shapes, a quiet nod to LVMH's dizzying array of cultural efforts. Yet of the 150 brands initially on 24 Sèvres, only around 20 to 30 will be LVMH owned (that will include Louis Vuitton and Dior, neither of which are available via any other multibrand online boutique). In the case of LVMH-owned businesses, it will be possible to source inventory from across those brands' independent retail networks. For non-LVMH labels, inventory with either be acquired wholesale or controlled by those brands that operate their own shop-in-shop style retail channel, the same model operated by the store. ""Don't think of this as the LVMH e-commerce project; think of this as us taking Le Bon Marché international via the internet,"" Mr. Rogers said, playing down expectations for the first step of an overhaul of the group's approach to reaching customer. The initial success of the project will be measured by sales, although he emphasized that LVMH is a group that consistently takes a long-term view. ""Where I am from, people always said to me, 'You're late,'"" he said. ""It's already too crowded a space. But with Beats, we showed them they were wrong. I've walked that path before. I see that path here again.""  Plenty will be watching that journey closely, from established multibrand luxury rivals like Yoox Net-a-Porter and FarFetch, to technology platforms like Amazon, which has long expressed its clear intention to dominate the online fashion market, though with a limited degree of success to date. ""We actually currently have more Vuitton stores in the U.S. than Amazon does distribution points, which is great,"" Mr. Rogers said. ""In context, it means that hypothetically we could have as much logistics capacity in the U.S. as Amazon does. And as for our rivals, well, it is a big sky. There is still plenty of room for growth for all the players."" Referring to eLuxury, he added: ""We don't want to be early adopters. We have been before and we paid the price for that. And when it comes to the internet specifically, there isn't necessarily a reward for being first. There is, however, currently a major focus on omnichannel and experience, and we are moving from a mass culture to a mass of niches. If there's quality in what you do, you're not threatened. Timing-wise, this is exactly where LVMH wants to be."""
3,2017-05-10," A few weeks ago, I bought a new television. When the whole process was over, I realized something incredible: To navigate all of the niggling details surrounding this one commercial transaction — figuring out what to buy, which accessories I needed, how and where to install it, and whom to hire to do so — I had dealt with only a single ubiquitous corporation: Amazon. It wasn't just the TV. As I began combing through other recent household decisions, I found that in 2016, nearly 10 percent of my household's commercial transactions flowed through the Seattle retailer, more by far than any other company my family dealt with. What's more, with its Echos, Fire TV devices, audiobooks, movies and TV shows, Amazon has become, for my family, more than a mere store. It is my confessor, my keeper of lists, a provider of food and culture, an entertainer and educator and handmaiden to my children. This may sound over the top. But what about you? I suspect that if you closely examine your own life, there's a good chance some other technology company occupies the same role for you as Amazon does for me: as warden of a very comfortable corporate prison. This is the most glaring and underappreciated fact of internet-age capitalism: We are, all of us, in inescapable thrall to one of the handful of American technology companies that now dominate much of the global economy. I speak, of course, of my old friends the Frightful Five: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google. The five are among the most valuable companies on the planet, collectively worth trillions. (Apple reached $800 billion in market capitalization this week, the first of any public company to do so, and the others may not be far behind.) And despite the picture of Silicon Valley as a roiling sea of disruption, these five have gotten only stronger and richer over time. Their growth has prompted calls for greater regulation and antitrust intervention. There's rising worry, too, over their softer, noneconomic influence over culture and information — for instance, fears over how Facebook might affect democracies — as well as the implicit threat they pose to the jurisdictions of world governments. These are all worthy topics for discussion, but they are also fairly cold and abstract. So a better way to appreciate the power of these five might be to take the very small view instead of the very large — to examine the role each of them plays in your own day-to-day activities, and the particular grip each holds on your psyche. So, last week I came up with a fun game: If an evil, tech-phobic monarch forced you to abandon each of the Frightful Five, in which order would you do so, and how much would your life deteriorate as a result? To help answer this, please take a moment with this column's companion quiz. When I went through the thought experiment, I found that dropping the first couple of tech giants was pretty easy — but after that the process became progressively more unbearable. For me, Facebook was the first to go. I tend to socialize online using Twitter, Apple's messaging system, and Slack, the office-chat app, so losing Mark Zuckerberg's popular service (and its subsidiaries, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger) was not such a big deal. Next, for me, was Microsoft, which I found slightly more difficult to quit. I don't normally use any Windows devices, but Microsoft's word-processing program, Word, is an essential tool for me, and I'd hate to lose it. In third place, full of regrets: Apple. There's nothing I use more than my iPhone, and close behind are my MacBook and iMac 5K, which may be the best computer I've ever owned. Abandoning Apple would prompt deep and truly annoying rearrangements in my life, including braving Samsung's bad software. But I could do it, grudgingly. It's when I imagine getting down to the last two that life becomes something else. It's here that you begin to confront how thoroughly the Frightful Five have woven their way into our lives, and how completely we've come to depend on them. In fourth place, for me, was Google. I just can't fathom living without it. Without the world's best search engine, my job would become well-nigh impossible. Without YouTube, it would become significantly less entertaining. Without everything else Google makes — email, maps, calendar, translation software, photo storage and the Android mobile operating system, which I'd need after ditching Apple — I'd be relegated to a life of some poor soul from long ago (say, 1992). And then, finally, we confront the master of my domain. I have been shopping at Amazon almost since the moment it went online in the 1990s. (I was a curious college student, I liked to experiment.) Every year since, as my life got busier and accreted more responsibility (in other words, as I became more and more of a stereotypical dad), Amazon took on an ever-greater role in my life. When the kids were born, it became my household's Costco — supplier of diapers and other baby gear. Then it began to launch a series of services designed to remove any decision-making from shopping: My toilet paper, paper towels and other consumables now come to my house on schedule, no thinking required. Then Amazon launched media, and I was more hooked: It had me for packaged goods, so why not movies and TV shows, too? A few years ago I would have thought that was the limit. Then came Echo, the company's talking computer, which speaks through a persona known as Alexa, and which has infected my family like a happy virus. Echo has a way of ingratiating itself into one's most mundane moments. I rewired my household's lights to be able to control them through Alexa. I changed the kind of coffee I buy so that I could tell Alexa to reorder it. When Amazon announced, this week, a new screen-enabled Echo, and a feature to let Echos act as phones, I experienced another frisson of possibility. Amazon, I see now, is well on its way to becoming my household's brain, a kind of butler in the sky that runs the place for me. Which brings me back to my new TV. Did you know that Amazon now sells not just goods but also home services? If you buy a TV, it will offer to sell you a wall mount, and if you buy the mount, it will offer to send someone to your house to install the equipment for a surprisingly reasonable fee. What might, in the past, have taken a trip to several stores, a truck, some tools, some friends, and many hours now gets done in a handful of clicks. One evening three days after I'd ordered the TV, the Amazon men came by and set up the whole thing while I cooked dinner. If such a future makes you blanch, that's the right reaction. I have fallen victim to the convenience trap, and you're right to laugh at me, and also to spin dystopian visions from my behavior — a future in which many others do as I do, in which vast portions of commercial activity flow through this single online store. And sure, you can decide to opt out; you can drive to Target, your life won't end if you don't patronize Amazon. But if it's not Amazon for you, it'll be another of the five. Or, more likely, it already is. It's too late to escape."
0,2017-05-11," When Chris Kraus walked into the New York Botanical Garden on a recent rainy Saturday, it felt like a homecoming. Ms. Kraus, a writer, has lived in Los Angeles since 1995, but the first chapter of her life was set in the Bronx, and her last apartment in New York was a short subway ride from the garden. Its flora and fauna were familiar friends. ""This is a classic,"" she said, looking up at a just-bloomed cherry blossom tree. ""This is my Facebook cover photo."" Ms. Kraus, 62, spends little time on social media, but she is well aware that her first novel, ""I Love Dick,"" has become an internet phenomenon. Young readers post photos of its cover on Instagram with the hashtag #chriskraus. (Moderators have censored #ilovedick.) They quote from the novel in posts on Twitter. The writer Emily Gould even started a Tumblr account where she solicits selfies from the book's growing audience, a group that includes Lena Dunham, Tavi Gevinson and Lorde. Ms. Gevinson, the editor and actress, has been a fan of Ms. Kraus's since 2013, when she was 17 years old and working on the second Rookie Yearbook. ""I have two journals where the spines say something like 'Mostly ""I Love Dick"" Quotes: Part 1' and 'Mostly ""I Love Dick"" Quotes: Part 2,'"" she said in a phone interview. First published in 1997 by Semiotext(e), the book had anemic sales. It was reintroduced in 2006 with a foreword by the poet Eileen Myles and, according to its publisher, sold over 50,000 copies worldwide in 2016 after a steady drumbeat of endorsements from n+1, Jezebel and other publications. Now it will get an even bigger publicity boost from its adaptation by Ms. Myles's former girlfriend, Jill Soloway, into an Amazon mini-series that begins streaming Friday. It stars Kathryn Hahn, Griffin Dunne and Kevin Bacon, and has an all-female writing staff. ""On a certain level, your first reaction is to cringe,"" Ms. Kraus said of the increased exposure, ""especially because the character names in the book are not changed."" ""I Love Dick"" tells the story of Chris Kraus, a 39-year-old experimental filmmaker who sees herself as more of an ""academic groupie"" than an artist. She and her husband, a 56-year-old professor named Sylvère Lotringer, invite a fellow scholar (named in New York magazine as Mr. Lotringer's colleague Dick Hebdige) out for a casual sushi dinner that turns into an intellectual ménage à trois, and then more. The book unfolds in an epistolary format, and Dick becomes Chris's ""perfect reader,"" reflecting her desire to be taken seriously as an artist. In real life, Mr. Lotringer was the founder of Semiotext(e), and he is still an editor at the press, along with the writer Hedi El Kholti and Ms. Kraus. He married Ms. Kraus in 1988, a few years after she invited him to see her first avant-garde performance, ""Disparate Action/Desperate Action."" ""I wrote letters to 10 famous people that I wanted to have see my work,"" Ms. Kraus said. ""Susan Sontag was one, Richard Foreman was another. Sylvère was the only one who came."" She has always been open about the autobiographical elements of ""I Love Dick,"" which include obsession, consummation and rejection at the hands of the title character. ""It seemed so stupid to us that we would have to dissemble it any other way,"" Ms. Kraus said. ""I mean, who hasn't had an affair? Who hasn't had a crush? What is the big secret?"" She and Mr. Lotringer lived on separate coasts in 1995, when Ms. Kraus moved to California for a job at ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena. They had an open marriage, and they eventually met other partners and divorced in 2013. They remain close, however, and now live ""around the corner from each other"" in Los Angeles. Both have homes in Baja California, Mexico, where they often retreat to write. Her background is fairly traditional, if itinerant. Her father, Oswald, worked for Cambridge University Press, and her mother, Ruth, had a series of clerical jobs. Chris was born in 1955, and her sister, Carol, followed three years later. They lived in the Bronx until 1960, and then Milford, Conn. When Ms. Kraus was 13, the family moved to New Zealand on the Assisted Passage Migration Scheme, and after a whirl through high school, she enrolled at the Victoria University of Wellington when she was 16. ""Maturity is being increasingly delayed and deferred these days,"" she said. ""Here, you're on your parents' health insurance until you're 26. But in New Zealand, at 16, you're pretty much an adult."" After graduation, Ms. Kraus became a journalist but was ambivalent about how she had to ""bond with people and then betray them by writing about them."" At 21, she moved to the East Village in New York and studied acting. ""I wrote a lot for a feminist newspaper called Majority Report, where they paid you in restaurant vouchers and subway slugs,"" she said. To pay her rent, she took up odd jobs and artist assistantships, including one with Louise Bourgeois. In the early '80s, she began writing and directing films, but they weren't successful commercially or critically, causing frustration that she later explored in ""I Love Dick"" and her second novel, ""Aliens & Anorexia."" Then, in 2006, Ms. Kraus published ""Torpor,"" a well-received prequel of sorts about a faltering couple (with different names) seeking to heal their marriage through the adoption of a Romanian child, prompting Mr. El Kholti to reintroduce ""I Love Dick."" It was a ""moment where all of these brilliant people who hadn't published books yet were keeping blogs,"" Ms. Kraus said. Continuing to draw from life, she will in September publish ""After Kathy Acker,"" a book that ""may or may not be a biography"" of Ms. Acker, an experimental novelist who died in 1997 after a battle with breast cancer. She appears as a figure throughout Ms. Kraus's novels and was also once involved with Mr. Lotringer. ""But that's a long time ago, and that certainly isn't why I chose to write about her,"" Ms. Kraus said. ""In fact, that's why it took so long to write about her."" Watching a white-dress-and-veil wedding amid an Earth Day parade in the garden, Ms. Kraus described her comparatively modest wedding to Philip Valdez, a psychologist, a little over two years ago. The ceremony took place in front of a dozen or so friends, on the patio of their home in Los Angeles, with decorations from a 99-cent store, a homemade cake and an officiant they found online. Ms. Kraus continues to teach part time at ArtCenter, subsidizing her salary with money she makes as a property manager. And she hasn't given up acting: She and Paul Giamatti appear in the artist Frances Scholz's ""Amboy,"" a 2015 film about a fictional artist. ""We staged this thing at Cal Arts where I was going be giving a lecture as part of their series to the art students, about the American artist Amboy,"" she said. ""They all showed up for it, and they didn't know it was fake."" In fact, they pretended they had heard of him. The neighborhood where she and Mr. Valdez live, near MacArthur Park, is ""as close as you can come"" to New York in California, Ms. Kraus said with a touch of wistfulness. ""But it's not the same."""
1,2017-05-11," Watching ""I Love Dick"" is like attending an exhibition for which the artist has supplied her own curator's notes. It's an experience as much as a story: arresting, disorienting and provocative. It's also very conscious of explaining to you how and why it arrests, disorients and provokes. The form of ""I Love Dick,"" whose eight-episode first season arrives on Friday on Amazon, fits its subject. Adapted by Jill Soloway (""Transparent"") and the playwright Sarah Gubbins from a cult novel by Chris Kraus, it's art TV about artists, a love triangle as Conceptual performance. The first corner of that triangle is Dick Jarrett (Kevin Bacon), a famous abstract sculptor and rancher in Marfa, Tex. (The novel's Dick was based on the media theory scholar Dick Hebdige; this one is inspired by the Marfa artist Donald Judd.) As a sideline, Dick runs a residency fellowship program, where he collects artists and intellectuals like prickly cactuses. One makes video game art; another studies the aesthetics of pornography. Enter Sylvère (Griffin Dunne), Dick's newest fellow and a Holocaust scholar, who arrives from Brooklyn with his wife, Chris (Kathryn Hahn), an experimental director whose latest work has just been dropped from the Venice Film Festival. Over dinner with Chris and Sylvère, Dick condescendingly suggests that she failed because women are lousy filmmakers. ""They have to work from behind their oppression,"" he says, ""which makes for some bummer movies."" Chris is infuriated, but also turned on. (Chris and Sylvère have been in a sexual dry spell, and remember, we're talking Cowboy Kevin Bacon here.) She channels this rage-lust into a series of ""Dear Dick"" letters, prose-poem mash notes that punctuate the series, in all-caps, white-on-red screen graphics, like Barbara Kruger aphorisms: ""I WANT TO OWN EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO ME NOW."" Chris plans to keep the letters to herself, but reads one to Sylvère. It has an aphrodisiac effect. Dick becomes an invisible third player in their marriage and a source of creative arousal — until the letters become public, and the season spins into drama and farce. A theme here — and in case you miss it, the characters explain it explicitly — is the experience of women in an art world that has historically seen them as nudes to be painted, forms to inspire. Chris flips this by making the great-man artist into her muse. (""It's humiliating,"" he admits.) Ms. Hahn, a frequent comedy actress whose dramatic talent Ms. Soloway showcased in ""Transparent"" and the movie ""Afternoon Delight,"" shows fantastic range as Chris: raw-nerved, hyperverbal and caught up in her own head. Dick, whom Mr. Bacon plays as dry as jerky, is her opposite: coolly dismissive and laconic. His work is rugged and phallic, austere and withholding. One of his signature pieces is a brick on a table. He refuses to title his sculptures and says he hasn't read a book in 10 years because he's ""post-idea."" More accurately, he's all idea, a beefcake avatar of linear thinking and pretension. (In a hilarious art-porn fantasy sequence, Chris imagines him shirtless, shearing a lamb in the middle of the road.) Thematically, making Dick a symbol as much as a person works. Ms. Soloway has said she wants the series to exemplify the ""female gaze"" in art. But, together with the familiarity of Chris and Sylvère's frustrated-intellectual-couple dynamic, it makes it harder to invest in the relationship triangle. The characters' tendency to explicate the story's themes is also distancing, albeit plausible for a series about theory-conscious aesthetes. I've likened ""Transparent,"" Ms. Soloway's remarkable Amazon series about a transgender woman and her family, to ""The Wire."" Both are fueled by social mission, which can be the death of nuance, yet they make their messages organic rather than preachy. To push the analogy, ""I Love Dick"" might be her ""Treme"" (David Simon's New Orleans follow-up to ""The Wire""), exploring similar themes — here, feminism, identity and power — as expressed through culture and art. ""I Love Dick,"" like ""Transparent,"" owns its seriousness and its characters, but it has a sense of humor about it. Early on, Sylvère is introduced to the president of the fellowship's board, who, he's told, is ""a big fan of the Holocaust."" But the series is best when it does what art does: to express what can't be said literally, to be the painting — or the brick — and not the plaque next to it. Ms. Soloway directs the fifth and best episode, a transfixingly visualized 20-minute collection of monologues by women in the Marfa community about art and their sexual awakenings. Roberta Colindrez is luminous and intense as Devon, a lesbian playwright and working-class Marfa native. If the series has future seasons, it has a strong ensemble to build on. If the first season doesn't entirely hang together, it's bracingly risk-taking. At its best, it captures the artistic process in a way that TV rarely does, and it works as a kind of video art itself. But as with some other recent experimental series — ""The Young Pope,"" for instance — it's best to realize that going in. Toward the end of the season, Chris mentions to Dick that she's seen a new work of his — a line of boulders outdoors, snaking toward the horizon. ""Did you like it?"" he asks. She hedges: ""I just need a little bit of time to, you know, just process it."" ""I Love Dick,"" too, feels as if it might work better in memory than in the moment — once you've had some time to sit with it for a while, and tune out the noise."

0,2017-05-16," Twenty years ago this week, Amazon.com went public. Skeptics of Jeff Bezos, the company's founder, have spent the better part of the past two decades second-guessing and vilifying him: He has been described as ""a monopolist,"" ""literary enemy No. 1,"" ""a notorious international tax dodger,"" impossible, a ruthless boss and — more than once — ""Lex Luthor."" His company used to routinely be described as Amazon.con. But you know what? Here we are, 20 years later, and Mr. Bezos has an authentic, legitimate claim on having changed the way we live. He has changed the way we shop. He has changed the way companies use computers, by moving much of their information and systems to cloud services. He's even changed the way we interact with computers by voice: ""Alexa!"" Along the way, he has bought — and fixed — The Washington Post, one of the nation's premier journalistic institutions. And through his aerospace company, Blue Origin, he has invested billions of dollars in the race to space, a onetime hobby that, if successful, could change the world much more profoundly than free one-day shipping. Even Warren Buffett was skeptical of Amazon way back when. ""I was too dumb to realize what was going to happen,"" he admitted at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting this month. ""I've admired Jeff, and I've admired him for a long, long time. But I did not think he was going to succeed on the scale that he has."" Mr. Buffett added, ""We missed it entirely."" He called Mr. Bezos' work ""a remarkable business achievement,"" saying, ""One person has built an extraordinary economic machine in two pretty different industries almost simultaneously, from a standing start at zero, with competitors with lots of capital and everything else."" Mr. Buffett's partner, Charles T. Munger, put it this way: ""Jeff Bezos is a different species."" Today, Amazon's valuation is $464 billion — twice the value of Walmart. If you had invested $10,000 at the I.P.O., you'd have nearly $5 million today. Sometimes praise is due. And he is clearly having a moment. Perhaps the most surprising thing Mr. Bezos was able to accomplish, despite his detractors, was to find investors willing to trust him enough to invest in Amazon even as it racked up losses after losses. That's not to say investors were always happy with Mr. Bezos — they would frequently punish his stock, making it seem like a volatile investment. Then, every so often, he would surprise investors with profits, as if to suggest, ""Yes, we can make money whenever we want, if we don't want to invest in the future."" Most executives are worried about the next quarter, but Mr. Bezos is worried about what will happen years from now. That is a competitive advantage that many chief executives could learn from. ""If everything you do needs to work on a three-year time horizon, then you're competing against a lot of people,"" Mr. Bezos told Wired in 2011. Here, he was expressing the view that some chief executives think in three-year cycles — a relatively generous assessment, given that most top executives don't last many more years than that. ""But,"" he continued, ""if you're willing to invest on a seven-year time horizon, you're now competing against a fraction of those people, because very few companies are willing to do that."" To Mr. Bezos' credit, he was always upfront with his ambitions and long-term approach. ""Because of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh trade-offs differently than some companies,"" he wrote in his first letter to shareholders in 1997. ""We aren't so bold as to claim that the above is the 'right' investment philosophy, but it's ours, and we would be remiss if we weren't clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take."" None of this is meant to suggest that Mr. Bezos is perfect. Far from it. He has repeatedly failed — remember his ill-fated foray into mobile phones? — but he has succeeded enough to outweigh his failures. And along the way, he is likely to fail again, something he says he embraces. Is Mr. Bezos an easy boss? Hardly. He is unbelievably demanding. But it is difficult to believe that the creative new products Amazon has incubated and introduced could have been born if he were a professional soul-crusher. As an author, I'm supposed to hate Mr. Bezos. After all, he has pressured publishers, cut their margins and practically put old-school bookstores out of business. As if to rub it in, he's now introducing bricks-and-mortar Amazon bookstores. But to take that view would be to misunderstand what innovation looks like. It upends industries — witness the current carnage in the retail industry, which has been outmoded by Amazon and all the companies trying to copy it. ""Amazon is not happening to book selling,"" Mr. Bezos explained, defending his role in a 2013 interview with Charlie Rose. ""The future is happening to book selling."" And the future is now happening to retail stores and even supermarkets — Mr. Bezos' next conquest. And the future is clearly happening to enterprise computing. Mr. Bezos has a famous laugh; look it up on YouTube. He has every right to be laughing right now."
0,2017-05-18," Walmart has always excelled at selling products in its cavernous stores. It appears to be getting its head around selling online, too. On Thursday, the company said e-commerce sales had grown 63 percent in the United States in the latest quarter. The unexpected leap offered the strongest evidence yet that Walmart, the country's largest retailer, is making headway in its effort to be as prominent online as it is across the American landscape. ""This is extraordinary growth, and we're pleased with the traction we're generating across our e-commerce offerings,"" said Brett Biggs, Walmart's executive vice president and chief financial officer. Now the question is whether the company can sustain that growth to become a fiercer competitor to the online juggernaut Amazon. Walmart has invested heavily into building its online business over the years, but the results have been mixed — and Amazon has surged. Walmart's latest strategy, put in place by its current chief executive, Doug McMillon, has several parts: expand the number of products available online, better leverage its huge physical warehouses and distribution centers to reach customers quickly across the country, and aggressively pursue deals for online stores. The biggest of those deals, in which Walmart paid $3.3 billion for the bulk e-commerce retailer Jet.com last year, was part of the plan to offer customers more products through the web. The earnings results on Thursday gave only hints of about how much the acquisitions gave the company a one-time bump in sales, rather than long-lasting fruit from other changes the company has made. Overall sales rose 1.4 percent, to $117.5 billion, in the latest quarter compared with a year ago. Walmart executives said that the ""majority"" of the company's online growth was organic — meaning not from the companies it had bought — but did not break out specific numbers. And while they were hesitant to declare that such growth was the new normal, they credited an expanded online assortment for helping to lure more repeat customers willing to open their wallets a little wider. Walmart said it now offers 50 million items through its website, up from 35 million in the last quarter and 10 million from the same time last year. Comparable-store sales, one measure of growth that looks at stores that have been open for at least a year, rose 1.4 percent. That number includes Walmart's core online business, but not items sold through Jet.com. Walmart completed its purchase of Jet in September. Smaller digital acquisitions followed, including ModCloth, a women's clothing retailer, and the outdoor apparel site Moosejaw. The deal for Jet was also widely seen as a play for its founder, Marc Lore, a serial digital entrepreneur who could help fix Walmart's online strategy. Mr. Lore was put in charge of running Walmart.com after the acquisition, spearheading the face-off between the world's largest brick-and-mortar retailer and its biggest online competitor. There is no doubt, though, that the company still has a ways to go before coming close to Amazon in e-commerce. Activity on Amazon, which recorded about $136 billion in annual sales last year, accounts for more than half of all online shopping in the United States. Walmart provides a growth figure only for its online business, and does not specify revenue. ""I think it's fair to say that Walmart is coming from behind online,"" said Neil Saunders, the managing director of the research firm GlobalData Retail. ""It has underperformed in that area, so what we're seeing now is really a catch-up to where it needs to be in order to more seriously compete with the likes of Amazon."" But Walmart is also trying to improve its physical stores, and the results on Thursday indicated that those changes were helping. While profit fell 1.3 percent for the quarter, the uptick in comparable-store sales bucked the troubles many other large retailers have signaled recently. Target, for example, on Wednesday reported a small drop in same-store sales in its most recent quarter compared with the year before. Bruised by complaints of empty shelves and poor customer service, Walmart pledged to invest in training its in-store associates and revamping its grocery business with services like allowing customers to buy items online and pick them up in a store. It has also cut back on labor costs, relying more on automation. Customers at many stores can now make purchases through self-checkouts. The company has begun testing drones to handle inventory at its labyrinthine warehouses. In March, the company received a patent for a process in which drones would transport products between departments in stores. Shares of Walmart stock rose about 3 percent to close at $77.54."
0,2017-05-23," SEATTLE — Today, most people know Amazon's Echo speaker as an easy way to play music using voice commands, but the device and others like it are catching on as ways to control light switches, thermostats and other smart home appliances. Now Amazon has a deal with one of the best known purveyors of home furnishings — Ikea — to make Alexa, the voice assistant inside Echo, more integrated into homes. On Tuesday, Ikea plans to announce that by this summer, its recently introduced line of smart lighting products can be controlled through voice commands. (Right now, these lights can be activated with an app). The products in the Swedish retailer's new Tradfri line include light bulbs that work with traditional lamps. Through the integration with Amazon's products, the bulbs will be wirelessly connected to Alexa so people can instruct the assistant to turn the lights on or dim them in various rooms of a house. The arrangement is not exclusive to Amazon, so Ikea can strike similar agreements with makers of other smart speakers like Google Home. The backing of Ikea, known for its affordable, mass-market furnishings, could help attract more public curiosity about smart home appliances, which most consumers have not yet seen a compelling reason to purchase. In an interview, Daniel Rausch, vice president for smart home at Amazon, said the relationship with Ikea would allow people to outfit a room with smart lighting for just ""tens of dollars."" Currently on Amazon, a smart lighting starter kit from Philips that includes two bulbs and a hub that enables connecting wirelessly sells for a little less than $70. The price on Ikea's website for a hub and its two least expensive bulbs is just under $54, or less than $42 with one bulb. Amazon has said there have been ""tens of millions of Alexa devices"" sold, including various devices in Amazon's Echo family of products and others from independent device makers. While a lot of people use Echo to play music from Spotify or from radio stations, Mr. Rausch said smart home usage of the devices was growing rapidly. He said Alexa users gave home-related commands — like ""raise the temperature in the living room"" and ""turn on the dining room lights"" — millions of times a day. The number of such commands by Alexa users grew 500 percent in the period from March to May compared with the same period the year before he said. One obstacle to the growth of the smart home market has been that most individual products — thermostats, sprinkler systems, smart plugs and light bulbs — require separate apps to control them. For a person fumbling in the dark with a bag of groceries, simply flicking the lights on is much less of a hassle than opening an app on a smartphone to perform the same task. But being able to command all or most of a home's smart appliances using voice, as people can do through Alexa, could make them more appealing, analysts said. ""I think this idea of voice control is really going to accelerate this whole market, and I think Amazon is very much ahead,"" said Victoria Petrock, an analyst at eMarketer, a technology research firm. ""That's not to say the race is won."" EMarketer recently estimated that this year, 35.6 million Americans will use a voice-enabled speaker at least once a month. Amazon's Echo devices will have about 70 percent of the market, and Google Home will have under 24 percent."
0,2017-05-24," The third season of ""Transparent"" ends with Shelly Pfefferman, played by Judith Light, performing her one-woman show ""To Shell and Back"" on a cruise ship. The musical moment, one of many in the award-winning Amazon series, happens so naturally that it's easy to wonder: What if this were a musical? That, at least, is the question at the heart of Faith Soloway's cabaret performance — ""Should 'Transparent' Become a Musical?"" — coming to Joe's Pub on June 19. Ms. Soloway, a writer for the show and the sister of its creator, Jill Soloway, said she plans to perform some original songs for the could-be musical with a group of friends, including the comedian Megan Amram, for what she is billing as ""a night of overly earnest song and prance."" This will be the second workshop-style cabaret, after an earlier performance in Boston, where Faith Soloway lives. (She splits her time between there and Los Angeles for ""Transparent."") She described the audience — whose feedback is welcome and whose ticket sales benefit the nonprofit Americans United — as ""part therapist, part people behind the desk"" while she tries out new songs. Like the plot of ""Transparent,"" which follows the Pfefferman family's ups and downs after one parent comes out as transgender, Ms. Soloway's songs are both serious and funny. ""I'm kind of getting back to my roots,"" she said, referring to her history as the music director of Second City in Chicago and the composer of so-called ""schlock operas"" like ""Jesus Has Two Mommies."" Before ""Transparent"" existed as fans know it today, the Soloway sisters had thought of writing it as a musical documentary — a film form that may not actually exist. ""We even had a documentarian following us around while we worked on it,"" Faith Soloway said. That didn't happen, of course. Still, music is central to many of the show's key moments — whether performed in a studio, played in a nightclub or sung by Ms. Light — largely because Jill Soloway is ""a big music fan,"" her sister said. But don't expect ""Transparent"" to become a stage musical just yet. Faith Soloway is busy: In addition to writing for the show and other work, she is developing a new TV series, tentatively titled ""Super Sensitives."" ""There's no pressing musical about to happen,"" she said. ""It's going to be such a long burn."""
1,2017-05-24," Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, has often struck a defiant tone when asked about the company's dominance of the book industry. ""Amazon is not happening to book selling,"" he said in a 2013 interview. ""The future is happening to book selling."" But when he made that remark four years ago, even a visionary like Mr. Bezos might not have imagined that the future would look so retro. After contributing to the demise of many bricks-and-mortar bookstores, Amazon has made a surprising pivot, with plans for a growing constellation of bookstores around the country. Now, Amazon is bringing its experimental, data-driven approach to physical retail to Midtown Manhattan, the heart of the publishing industry. On Thursday, Amazon will open a store — its seventh — in the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle. The 4,000 square-foot space, near the site of a now-shuttered Borders store, is just a few blocks from Penguin Random House, and walking distance from Simon & Schuster and Hachette's Midtown headquarters. This summer, the company plans to open another store on 34th Street. In a city that prides itself on being a literary mecca, the response to Amazon's arrival was, unsurprisingly, mixed. ""I'm happy there's a new store where people can see books and encounter them, but I'd rather we were in there,"" said Chris Doeblin, the owner of Book Culture, an independent bookstore on the Upper West Side. ""If I had the money, I would go and open a store right next to Jeff Bezos's store."" Amazon is planning to open six more stores this year, including outlets in Bellevue, Wash.; Paramus, N.J;, and San Jose, Calif. The company's push into physical stores might seem at odds with its origins as an online retailer. But it fits with Amazon's continuing expansion into nearly every corner of the publishing industry. Since its founding more than 20 years ago, Amazon has become the dominant book retailer, and has created niches along the way. It accounts for nearly half of all book sales in the United States, including print and e-books, according to the Codex Group, which analyzes the industry. With the introduction of the Kindle in 2007, Amazon drove the e-book and self-publishing boom. It bought Audible, the audiobook producer and retailer, and Goodreads, the popular book review sharing site. It started a publishing company, and now has 14 imprints. Last week, the company introduced Amazon Charts, weekly best-seller lists that track not only the top-selling digital and print books on Amazon, but the ones that customers spend the most time reading. Drawing on data collected from Kindle users and Audible listeners, the most-read list compiles which books are most popular with its customers across digital formats. It is data that Amazon has long collected but never made widely public. ""This is the first time we're sharing this information with readers,"" said Susan Stockman, who oversees Amazon Charts. With its lists, Amazon aims to redefine the notion of a best seller, expanding it to include books that are ""borrowed"" from its e-book subscription service, and ones that are streamed on Audible. As a result, the lists give increased visibility to books that might not typically appear on other best-seller lists, like The New York Times's or The Wall Street Journal's. The inaugural Amazon Charts list for most-sold fiction features five books from Amazon Publishing, out of 20 on the list. ""This is their attempt to push back and say, we're legitimate,"" said Peter Hildick-Smith, the president of the Codex Group. All of Amazon's acquisitions and new features are having a cumulative effect, allowing the company to draw on its vast customer base and troves of data to discover what is popular, and return that information to customers, creating a lucrative feedback loop. Eventually, the weekly best-seller lists may be incorporated into displays in Amazon's bookstores, and perhaps posted on Goodreads. They are already available on Alexa, Amazon's virtual assistant, which will recite the new best-seller lists when asked. ""Amazon created a new model, and now they are hijacking the best-seller list idea to conform to what they were doing,"" said Mike Shatzkin, the chief of Idea Logical Company, a book industry consulting firm. ""It's definitely an intrusion of their business model into the overall ecosystem."" The new lists have led to speculation that they might eventually challenge more established best-seller lists like The Times's. David Naggar, Amazon's vice president, while not referring to a specific competing list, said, ""Many of the weekly lists that are out there today tend to curate, they rerank or add or remove books."" He described Amazon's new lists as ""unfiltered and unedited."" Danielle Rhoades Ha, a Times spokeswoman, said that readers ""value the rigor and independence of the New York Times best-seller lists."" ""Unlike lists from individual retailers, our best-seller lists are based on a detailed analysis of book sales from a wide range of retailers in markets nationwide who provide us with specific and confidential context of their sales each week,"" she said. ""These standards are applied consistently, across the board in order to provide readers the best assessment of what books are the most broadly purchased at that time.'' Crowdsourcing and data mining are also driving the company's approach to its bookstores, which act as showcases for books popular with customers on the site. While the stores have traditional categories, like fiction, nonfiction and travel, the most eye-catching shelves feature categories culled from Amazon's customer data. ""We call this a physical extension of Amazon.com,"" said Jennifer Cast, vice president of Amazon Books, during a tour of the Manhattan store on Tuesday. ""We incorporate data about what people read, how they read it and why they read it."" The first thing customers see when they walk into the store is a large display table, labeled Highly Rated, which includes books with an average rating of 4.8 stars or higher on a scale of 5, among them best sellers like ""Born a Crime"" by Trevor Noah and ""Shoe Dog"" by Phil Knight. Another display case, labeled Page-Turners, features books that people finish reading on their Kindle in fewer than three days. It includes a few thrillers, but also some serious nonfiction books like ""Hillbilly Elegy"" by J. D. Vance and ""When Breath Becomes Air"" by Paul Kalanithi. Another section features the most ""wished for"" books from Amazon's website, among them ""Tools of Titans"" by Tim Ferriss. At the back of the store is an area with books that have amassed more than 10,000 customer reviews. The books bear no prices. ""Amazon's pricing is dynamic,"" Ms. Cast said. So shoppers must scan books with an Amazon app on their cellphone or at one of the store's digital kiosks. The books are all displayed face out. Under each book is a card with the average customer rating, the number of reviews and a featured review from an Amazon reader. Displaying the full cover of each book mimics the visual look of Amazon's website, and might lure customers to unfamiliar titles. ""The purpose of this store is discovery,"" Ms. Cast said. ""If you already know what you want, you'll go online and get it."""
0,2017-05-25," Good morning on this wet Thursday. This Memorial Day is a milestone in our presidential history: It would have been the 100th birthday of John F. Kennedy. The 35th president, though born in Massachusetts, was a New Yorker in many ways. ""New Yorkers just accept him as an honorary New Yorker because he was here so much,"" said David Nasaw, a history professor at the City University of New York's Graduate Center and the author of a biography on the Kennedy family. ""And because he had this sophistication, this humor, this glamour, this wit and these smarts."" (Just like we city folk do, right?) Kennedy spent some of his formative years living in Riverdale and Bronxville. Later, in 1954, he stayed for several months at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Midtown Manhattan, where he underwent major spinal surgery and nearly died. But Kennedy's more positive moments in New York — his best ones, according to Mr. Nasaw — were during the years that followed, while he was campaigning ahead of the 1960 election. ""We overlook the fact that he wouldn't have been president without New York City,"" Mr. Nasaw said. ""Everybody thinks that New York is this staunch, always-Democratic state."" It wasn't always so: Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican, had carried New York in the previous two elections, and Richard M. Nixon had a good chance of beating Kennedy in New York in 1960, one of the closest presidential elections in the nation's history. Kennedy turned that around when he spoke at the Al Smith dinners in Manhattan in 1959 and 1960. ""He handled the Al Smith dinners as a comedian would, and he made Nixon look like a stiff fool,"" Mr. Nasaw said. ""Those speeches were widely covered, and three weeks before the election, I think that helped him a great deal."" Enough to earn New York State's vote — 53 percent to Nixon's 47 — and ultimately to help win the presidency. As president, Kennedy visited Madison Square Garden on May 19, 1962, for a fund-raiser and dinner in honor of his birthday, where he made a speech and Marilyn Monroe famously took the stage to sing ""Happy Birthday"" to him. The next day, he returned to the Garden to give another speech to older New Yorkers, on the need for the government to help them with health care. ""When you look at those two speeches juxtaposed, it tells you a lot about this guy,"" Mr. Nasaw said. ""It tells you that he was interested in policy, and he was also the first president who was a celebrity."" More than a half-century since Kennedy's assassination, one of the most significant memorials to him in New York City is the airport that bears his name, Mr. Nasaw said. ""It's a shame,"" he added. ""We go out and we curse at J.F.K. Airport, which is sort of a great irony that one way New Yorkers were going to honor him turned out to be much less of an honor than this man deserves."" You can honor him by continuing to learn about his legacy. One way to start: Check out a Kennedy-themed walking tour in Manhattan, taking place on his centennial on Monday.

0,2017-05-27," A non-virtual, real-life Amazon bookstore opened in Manhattan on Thursday with no obvious signs of corporate guilt at having driven countless independent bookstores to oblivion with the scythe-like power of the company's e-book discounting. The store opened to a crowd waiting outside, some of them curious about the retro spectacle of a big-box bookstore, as if resurrected from the dead, selling actual books over the counter instead of the internet. All in the name of Amazon, the Colossus that ate the Indies. ""We're all about discoverability,"" said one of the friendly employees offering greetings and guidance. The store's strategy is to mine Amazon's massive online archives of reader data to steer the most popular books to shoppers. The circularity of this crème-de-la-crème process provides the sales leverage. The store stocks only 3,000 of the most popular, data-driven titles — for instance, a history best seller that's been judged a good read by 2,796 previous readers, who gave it a 4.8 approval rating on a scale of 5. Collectively, the store boasts, its stock has received 1.7 million 5-star reviews from Amazon.com customers. How to resist in this age of rampant populism? The question was once addressed by Robert Silvers, founding co-editor of The New York Review of Books, the enduring resource for dedicated readers in Gotham and beyond. Mr. Silvers preferred to mine the tastes and opinions of gifted writers and editors whom he chose for being able to offer all manner of bookish recommendations and delights, not least some serendipity. ""We do what we want and don't try to figure out what the public wants,"" he explained unapologetically. In venturing offline with its seventh brick-and-mortar store nationally, Amazon signals that it is on to something new in its ever expansive business outlook. We all may have thought that product delivery by drone was the next big Amazon thing. But the future turns out to be a typical retail store in the Time Warner Center off Columbus Circle. Another half dozen are due this year, including a second Manhattan store, on 34th Street. The speculation is that dozens more are planned nationally and that Amazon, which already handles nearly half of the nation's book sales, may eventually expand into selling far more products than the books and Kindle electronics the stores currently offer. The store is tuned for speedy business, with sales via credit or debit cards, no cash. The privileges that come with Amazon Prime are quickly honored. No prices are evident; a customer runs a book under a scanner for Amazon's shifting price system. There's no cafe to indulge idle time, and the floors don't invite flopping with a book or a cranky toddler. Ask a worker about the narrow predictability of data mining, and the reply comes: ""It's data with heart."" Amazon says its recommendations include in-house ""curators' assessments"" to add a variable touch to the crowdsourcing. Still, the store lacks the little handwritten employee recommendations posted in independent bookstores as humanizing beacons. Amazon compensates at each book pile with a small placard featuring its percentiles of popularity and review notes from blurb-savvy customers (""Far beyond the ordinary…""). ""It's weird — they keep talking about 'discovery,' but how do you discover something different in a process that channels people into a smaller and smaller focus?"" asks Chris Doeblin, owner of the independent Book Culture store and two others in the city. Rejecting Amazon's strategy of stocking mainly data-tracked titles, Mr. Doeblin delights in offering more volumes ranging widely from best selling to barely known. ""People are willing to pay more for a better experience, for a real choice,"" he insists, having survived the challenge of Amazon online and now having to face its arrival as an actual store."
0,2017-05-29," BERLIN — To the dismay of parents everywhere, the MIT Press recently published a little red and white book titled ""Communism for Kids."" It teaches children how to run gulags, imitate genocidal dictators, praise Satan and pretty much destroy Western civilization — all for a reasonable price of $12.95. The author proudly endorses Barack Obama, Joseph Stalin, Bernie Sanders, Mao, Fidel Castro and millions of other communists who murdered 80 billion people, all the while surreptitiously spreading Jewish, queer and anti-American values to the next generation of freedom-seeking youngsters. At least, that's more or less the story according to Breitbart, National Review, American Conservative, The Daily Beast, The Daily Signal, Alex Jones, Rush Limbaugh, Milo Yiannopoulos, Steven Crowder, The Blaze, Pamela Geller, The Christian Truther, The Washington Free Beacon and Fox News. Not to mention the tens of thousands of tweets, Facebook posts, YouTube videos and Amazon reviews that virulently concur. There's only one small problem: None of it is true. Anyone who reads beyond the scandalous title will immediately recognize that the book is a critique of the history of communism. But it is an immanent critique, one that begins by accepting the premises of what it seeks to criticize. Unlike the army of sock puppet reviewers, I know this because I actually read the book. In fact, I had to read it many times because, along with Sophie Lewis, I translated the book from German into English. The author is Bini Adamczak, a Berlin-based scholar who has written extensively on the communist history of the Soviet Union and its many tragedies. The idea behind the book is that one can speak truthfully and poignantly about the political philosophy and economic history of capitalism and communism in much simpler language than that of economists, political scientists and policy experts. To do so, Ms. Adamczak tells a tale of peasants surviving the transition from feudalism to capitalism, a story about workers adapting to the market demands of capitalist productivity and a parable about different, failed attempts by proletarians and unemployed people to improve their social and economic conditions through collective organizing. Scary stuff, I know. Although the narrative is full of suffering, defeat and failure, the real scandal of the book lies in its optimism, its hope that another world is still possible in the womb of the old. More outrageous, such hope cannot be decreed from above by politicians, leaders or businesspeople, but only created from below by people struggling together for a fair, dignified and free way of life. Long before the Soviet Union crushed all political tendencies that favored a more libertarian form of socialism, the name for that way of life free from the misery of wage labor was called communism. In the philosophical epilogue to her book, Ms. Adamczak explicitly confronts the problem of how to speak about communism after a century of disasters committed in its name. As she makes abundantly clear, it's not easy. And yet, that doesn't let us off the hook. The only way to truly understand the failures of communism is to take seriously the motivations, desires and ideals of those who advocated it. But to do that, one must first understand capitalism. This is where it gets very confusing for most critics of communism, because Karl Marx himself praised the productivity, efficiency and power of the market economy. If only we can harness the energy of capitalism without its exploitative effects, many communists pondered, then surely we can create a better society for all. Or: If only the workers could own the factories themselves, then surely we could unleash the productive force of society. Or rather: If only we had economic experts to better manage the market, then surely we could satisfy the needs of all. Or even: If only more machines took care of our labor, then surely all our problems would be solved. Alas, the history of communism is littered with failed attempts by communists to be better at capitalism than the capitalists themselves. As Ms. Adamczak argues, this is because most communist criticisms of capitalism take one idealized aspect of capitalist society and pit it against the others, unwittingly perpetuating the framework communism sets out to abolish. This recipe for disaster recurs throughout history, and the only way to stop it is for everyone to learn about the unsuccessful attempts at revolution, so as not to repeat those mistakes in their current struggles. Hence, ""Communism for Kids."" In the vast sea of hogwash that flooded the conservative mediasphere after the book appeared in English, the same talking-point detritus floated to the surface over and over again: The book indoctrinates children with propaganda; it promotes an evil ideology that led to the death of millions; it is published by a prestigious university that should have known better; it is hypocritical, because it costs money; and it is fundamentally anti-American, anti-Christian and anti-family (and by implication, it's foreign, Jewish and queer). One reviewer even called it the ""most dangerous book on economics ever written for kids."" One hundred percent of these criticisms are based on a misunderstanding of the title, a basic denial of the fact that all commodities cost money in capitalism and a misconceived view of how academic publishing functions. None of this concerns the book's actual content. That didn't stop the internet swarm, the proper expression of digital communication today, as the philosopher Byung-Chul Han puts it. Ms. Adamczak's original German edition was just called ""Communism: A Little Story About How Everything Could Be Different."" In fact, it's not a children's book at all, but a book written for everyone in a language that, for the most part, children, too, could understand. The title we chose for the American edition was an elegant way to convey this aspect of the book. There is no propaganda, no brainwashing and no rose-tinted stories of happy-go-lucky communist do-gooders tricking kids into drinking the Marxist Kool-Aid. When the book first appeared in Germany, which was over a decade ago, there was no such rage. So what is it about the word ""communism"" that frightens Americans so much from left to right? Did the Red Scare ever end? I think, rather, that in America the fear of the word ""communism"" is tied to a fear of the word ""capitalism,"" another no-go word in polite discourse. It's easy to talk about markets, industry, the middle class, job creators, lean start-ups, globalization and the gig economy, but to identify our entire society as capitalist and to call our economic system capitalism is to hint at the possibility of an alternative organization of life. And that is dangerous, un-American, perhaps even communist. Naming the problem may be the first step toward curing the illness, but it doesn't yet tell us how to proceed. For that, we need ideas, experiments and dreams. Is it wise to dream about utopia while living in the dystopia of the present? The German Jewish philosopher Theodor Adorno, known for his negative stance toward the world after the experience of Auschwitz, notoriously proclaimed: ""There is no right life in the wrong one."" This is usually interpreted to mean that no ethical shifts of individual lifestyle can fix the social problems that systematically result from the political and economic structure of society. Individuals act within predetermined social roles, with little sway over the content of their lives except for a choice of character mask. The real agents of society are not people but things, commodities whose song and dance on the market we must all closely observe and abide by, on pain of starvation, homelessness and death. Adorno's bleak message was not intended for his contemporaries, but for the future — that is, for our present, so that we may understand how the past failures of revolution destroyed any concrete possibility of hope for another way of life. There's another reading of Adorno's remark. We may not be able to live a wrong life rightly, but we can stop living wrongly altogether. To do that requires a depth of social imagination, the courage of collective struggle and a wellspring of political desire that seems all but evaporated in the present moment. ""Communism for Kids"" is not a message in a bottle to some imagined future audience; it is rather a collection of broken shards from lost futures still jammed in the present. It is a cry from behind the curtain of history to rectify the injustices of the past by attending to the suffering of the present. I suggest we pay attention."
0,2017-05-30," SEATTLE — On Monday, Amazon.com's share price briefly crossed the $1,000 mark for the first time in its 20-year history as a publicly traded company. Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and chief executive, has been dismissive of the preoccupation with near-term stock price swings, often quoting the influential investor Benjamin Graham, who said the market is a voting machine in the short run and a weighing machine in the long run. Mr. Bezos has made it clear he wants Amazon to be weighed by investors, not subject to a near-term popularity contest. Cracking the arbitrary threshold of a four-digit stock price is a reminder of just how heavy Amazon has become. It is now the fourth most valuable company in the world by market capitalization. The top five, Apple, Alphabet, the parent company of Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook, have emerged as the dominant forces in technology. Amazon's shares are up almost 33 percent for the year and up 368 percent over five years. Crossing the $1,000 mark, said Christian Magoon, chief executive of Amplify ETFs, which includes a fund that holds Amazon shares, ""speaks to the triumph of e-commerce and the vision of Jeff Bezos."" The investor optimism about Amazon is, in many respects, unchanged from when it went public in 1997. Amazon remains a long-term play based on a wager that online shopping will replace a healthy chunk of traditional retail over time. Even with all of Amazon's staggering growth — $136 billion in revenue last year, compared with $148 million in 1997 — e-commerce still represents only around 10 percent of total retail spending in the United States, the company's most mature market. That leaves Amazon — which accounted for 43 cents of every dollar spent online in the United States last year, according to Slice Intelligence — with a lot of room to grow. Some analysts say its gains could be especially large in the coming years as more physical retailers close stores and file for bankruptcy. ""For any stock analyst trying to find growth and return on investment in the retail sector today, they're clearly putting money into Amazon because that's where they anticipate the growth coming from,"" said Cooper Smith, an analyst at L2, a retail research firm. Ty Rogers, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment. The stock closed at $996.70 on Tuesday, up 0.09 percent. Amazon has also given investors reason to believe it is not content to remain simply an e-commerce giant. Through its Amazon Web Services business, it is now the largest provider of cloud computing services in the world. It stands to benefit for many years as hundreds of billions of dollars in information technology spending shifts from traditional purchases of hardware and software to effectively renting them in the data centers. Because profit margins in cloud computing are wider than those in the retail business, Amazon, which had only a passing familiarity with profits over most of its life, is now consistently in the black. After an embarrassing smartphone venture, Amazon demonstrated that it, too, could stay ahead of important changes in consumer technology with the invention of Echo, a voice-activated speaker powered by an artificially intelligent assistant called Alexa. Although the company says little about sales of the devices, other than that tens of millions have been sold, Alexa appears to be emerging as a significant new technology platform, and Amazon's strategy is being widely imitated by rivals. One of those rivals, Alphabet, is not too far behind Amazon in chasing the $1,000 a share milestone (the market capitalization of Alphabet, which is far more profitable than Amazon, is still about $200 billion higher than that of the internet retailer). The most powerful technology companies are becoming even more powerful. Of course, that is no guarantee of staying power. Apple and Microsoft, much older than Amazon, each lost its way for a time. And tech pioneers like Hewlett-Packard, which split into two companies two years ago, and IBM have struggled to adapt to technology changes. Amazon is known for being ruthlessly competitive on prices for products it sells on its website, but that does not extend to its share price. Last week at the company's annual investor meeting in Seattle, a woman who said she was a longtime Amazon shareholder beseeched Mr. Bezos to split the company's stock to help make it more accessible to less wealthy investors. Mr. Bezos said Amazon considered such possibilities from time to time but had no plans for a split."
1,2017-05-30," We're following major developments in the markets throughout the day. Check below for the latest updates. Amazon's share price briefly topped $1,000 in early trading on Tuesday, a symbolic milestone for Jeff Bezos' e-commerce company. Amazon's stock is up sharply over the last three months, the latest surge in a climb that has lasted two decades. Another big tech stock is also near the $1,000 mark: Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is trading around $996 a share, having also risen sharply in recent months. Amazon is making itself indispensable on a number of fronts, most notably e-commerce and cloud computing. It is also expanding into areas like artificial intelligence and entertainment services. Our tech columnist recently wrote that of the big five tech companies — Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft — the one he would have the hardest time giving up was Amazon. Among the many things Amazon has going for it: • After years of unprofitability, it is reliably turning in profit. • Long the runaway leader in e-commerce, Amazon has tens of millions of subscribers for its Prime service. • The company is getting serious about drone delivery. • It has a surprise hit with the Echo, its artificial-intelligence-powered personal assistant. • It continues to dominate the book-selling industry, and — in a move rich with irony — is opening its own physical bookstores. • Bookstores aren't all. It has ambitious plans to expand further into brick and mortar retail. • It is exploring new ways to expand in retail, including filing a patent for a custom clothing manufacturing system. • It is pushing further into entertainment services, including a recent deal to stream National Football League games. • Its original television and film programming is good and getting better. The series ""Transparent"" is already a major hit, and the company just struck a deal to adapt Colson Whitehead's novel, ""The Underground Railroad,"" into a film directed by the Oscar winner Barry Jenkins. • All this, and it is adding jobs — this year, Amazon said it would add 100,000 jobs to meet demand on a number of fronts. And those are just headlines from the last six months. • Deutsche Bank's annual global financial services conference in New York began on Tuesday and runs for two days. The lender's chief executive, John Cryan, opened the event and participated in a keynote conversation with Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock. • Don't forget to read the DealBook Morning Agenda."

0,2017-06-05," Fear of no choice is starting to help Amazon's cloud rivals. Amazon's web-services division has monopoly-like features — it is huge and growing, and size makes it operationally and financially more efficient. Yet Jeff Bezos' company won't walk away with all the spoils. Customers are worried about being locked in, and that will keep competitors in business. Companies have come to realize it is simpler, cheaper and more convenient to store data and run applications on servers owned and operated by the likes of Amazon, Alphabet and Microsofts. Uncertainty over the cost implications is receding rapidly, according to surveys conducted by Bain and Morgan Stanley and highlighted by Kleiner Perkins's Mary Meeker in her annual ""Internet Trends"" presentation last week. The providers of cloud services have grown rapidly as a result. First-quarter revenue at Amazon Web Services was about 3.5 times as big as in the same period three years ago. At $3.7 billion for the period, it accounted for more than 10 percent of Amazon's total sales, and it was by far the most profitable slice. The operating margin for Amazon Web Services has nearly doubled over the last two years to around 25 percent. Not coincidentally, information technology managers have started to worry about the difficulty of switching cloud suppliers — a particular problem if one outfit, like Amazon Web Services, comes to dominate. This concern rocketed between 2012 and 2015, according to Ms. Meeker, with the proportion of respondents bothered by it surging from 7 percent to 22 percent. As in other sectors including, for instance, finance, companies will often ensure that at least two suppliers of each service stay in business, to retain the option of shifting between the two and maintain price competition. This doesn't always happen in technology. Alphabet's Google will, for example, claim 78 percent of United States search revenue this year, eMarketer estimated. However, it is a different calculus when a company is storing its data and building its business on a different company's platform. Real dangers include an Amazon shutdown — as happened in March — or hacking, both of which could threaten a customer's survival. For all the market sway enjoyed by Amazon Web Services, that means enterprises will want Microsoft and Alphabet to stay in the game."
1,2017-06-05," • Apple gave a sneak peek of HomePod, a speaker, to rival Amazon's Echo and Google's Home. It's the first brand-new hardware product for Apple since the Apple Watch. • The company also showed new iPads at its annual developer conference, which typically focuses on software instead of hardware. • Also unveiled: a new iMac Pro, upgraded iMacs and MacBooks, and updates to its operating systems. Amazon, with the Echo, pioneered a device that lets you play music, look up basic information and control your lighting and other home accessories. Now Apple's answer to the Echo — the HomePod — is here, kind of. Apple showed off HomePod on Monday, and it will be available in December. Apple had long been rumored to be working on a device meant to take on the Echo, which has become a surprise hit since Amazon released it nearly three years ago. The category is getting pretty crowded: Last year, Google released a talking home computer of its own, called Google Home, and Microsoft's assistant, Cortana, is also making its way to home speakers. So how will Apple compete? In a very Apple-like manner: The speaker, powered by the Siri voice assistant, looks spiffier than either Amazon's or Google's version — it is a seven-inch-tall canister wrapped in a shiny mesh speaker. The company also said it had prioritized the speaker's sound, which can be lackluster on rival devices. HomePod has an array of speakers to create virtual surround sound. ""You don't have to know what any of that is; just know that it sounds incredible,"" said Phil Schiller, Apple's marketing chief, who added that HomePod would be priced at $349. Although Apple appears to be trying to make up ground on Amazon and Google, the primary casualty may be Sonos. That company offers a wireless multispeaker system that allows users to listen to music throughout the home, similar to HomePod's ability to chain together speakers. The big question, though, is whether the intelligence inside Apple's speaker is good for anything beyond music. Apple was early to the voice game with Siri on the iPhone, but rivals have since lapped it — their voice-command devices are faster, they know more, and they are less annoying to use. Apple promises the new Siri is better, but the improvements it showed were only minor. (With the announcement of HomePod, Apple seems to be finally embracing the technologies it has long put on the back burner. Read more from Farhad Manjoo in his State of the Art column.) Apple's developer conference typically showcases software improvements. In a departure from that routine, Apple showed a lot of new hardware this time. That included updated versions of the iPad, which has been declining in sales. Apple showed that it was continuing to bet on the tablets by unveiling an iPad upgrade that the company's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said was pushing the device ""further than it ever has before."" The new version of the iPad Pro has a 10.5-inch display, 20 percent larger than the previous 9.7-inch model, and it will start at $649. Apple said the size made it perfect for displaying a virtual keyboard comparable to a full-size physical keyboard. The company also highlighted a feature called ProMotion that increases the refresh rate and makes motion smoother in video content. After Steve Jobs introduced the original iPad in 2010, tablets exploded in popularity, but iPad sales have slumped for more than a year now. So Apple, under increasing pressure from investors to strengthen its revenue, has upgraded iPads more frequently than many of its other products. The company introduced a cheaper version of the 9.7-inch iPad, priced at $329, in March and a 12.9-inch iPad Pro, compatible with an Apple stylus and keyboard, in 2015. Some of Apple's rivals have capitalized on the iPad's stumbles. Amazon said recently that its tablet sales had grown substantially compared with last year. Amazon's Kindle Fire tablets are extremely cheap, starting at $50, and they allow for basic functions like reading e-books, streaming Netflix and listening to music. Apple's predicament seems to be that for existing iPad customers, their tablets are still quite capable and running strong, giving them little reason to upgrade. For new customers, the iPad may be overkill for basic tasks, especially if you can just pay $50 for a media tablet from Amazon. One of Apple's splashiest hardware debuts was a brand new iMac Pro that will support up to 18 core processors and include a graphic chipset called Radeon Vega. Translation: It is Apple's all-in-one desktop on steroids. ""It's going to be the most powerful Mac we've ever made,"" said John Ternus, Apple's vice president for hardware engineering. The new iMac Pro may help compensate for Apple's previous professional desktop, the Mac Pro, which was widely panned by critics and customers. The iMac Pro will start at $5,000 and ship in December. With this device, Apple is broadly catering to members of the professional community, like filmmakers and hard-core coders. For years, these users have felt left behind as Apple has focused on consumer-oriented products like the iPhone, shifting away from high-performance equipment for professionals. The company also announced upgrades of its 27-inch and 21.5-inch iMacs, its desktop computers, which will start at $1,099, with additional models at $1,299 and $1,799. And Apple lowered some prices for its MacBooks and said the MacBook Air, its entry-level lightweight laptop, would get a speed increase. The 21.5-inch model with 4K high resolution will start at about $1,300, with a new 13-inch MacBook Pro starting at $1,300. Last year was rough for the Mac. Fans of the MacBook Pro waited for Apple to unveil a major upgrade after the laptop had remained relatively unchanged for about four years. But when Apple introduced a new MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar, a virtual touch strip embedded into its keyboard, customers were divided. Some fans concluded that the Mac was now in the back seat because Apple was prioritizing the iPhone, the iPad and the Apple Watch. Every year, Apple updates the underlying operating systems that power its devices. The changes are geeky — remember, they are aimed at software developers — but they eventually trickle down to how we use iPhones, Macs and Apple Watches. The most important update was to iOS, the operating system that underpins Apple's biggest seller, iPhones, as well as iPads. Apple introduced iOS 11, with improved camera software; upgrades for Siri; an expansion of its mobile payment system, Apple Pay; and a new version of Apple Maps, with indoor mapping and features to prevent distracted driving. Because the show is about giving new tools to developers, Apple also focused on emerging technologies. Specifically, Apple highlighted augmented reality, a way for people to view and digitally manipulate the physical world around them through the lens of their smartphone cameras. The iPhone already supports augmented reality with games like Pokémon Go. On Monday, Apple said it was offering a new tool kit for bringing advanced augmented reality applications to the iPhone and the iPad. Mr. Cook has spoken several times of Apple's interest in augmented reality, hinting that the company could be developing an augmented reality headset. Apple demonstrated changes to the operating system for the Apple Watch including a new watch face that uses Siri to suggest directions, show calendar items and generally predict what you will want to see. The most substantive changes focused on fitness, including the ability to track new types of high-intensity workouts. Apple also unveiled a new operating system for its Mac computers, called High Sierra. The company made privacy a key selling point with this and said the next version of its Safari web browser would block videos that automatically start playing and stop advertising trackers. While users will probably welcome those changes, the development was another blow to web publishers, who rely on ads that Apple will now block. Apple added optional ad blocking to the iPhone and the iPad last year."
0,2017-06-07," To the Editor: Re ""At Amazon's New Bookstore, No Coffee but All the Data You Can Drink,"" by Francis X. Clines (Editorial Observer, May 28): The description of the new Amazon retail bookstore in Manhattan gives the feel of all the warmth of the website, with a smaller selection. I have run an independent, family-friendly, politically progressive community bookstore for the past 34 years. Our selection depends not on an algorithm at all; it relies on what we judge our readers will like or feel is important. Our store invites that cranky toddler, the person who needs a safe space to rant about the latest lies of the Trump administration, the cancer patient who needs to talk and that local teacher who knows our staff can find what she needs. I hope that we will continue to serve readers who understand that a monopoly in the book industry will not serve a country of independent thinkers. NANCY BRAUS, PUTNEY, VT."
1,2017-06-07," Facebook. Amazon. Apple. Netflix. Google. Not only do they dominate our daily lives, but as their stocks continue to soar, these technology giants may also dictate our financial futures. In the last three years, their share prices have risen far faster than the major market indexes — Amazon leads the way, up 206 percent; Apple trails the pack with a 67 percent gain — as investors of virtually every stripe have piled into these companies. But this gold-rush mentality, reminiscent of investor frenzies for Nifty 50 stocks in the late 1970s and the dot-com boom and bust at the end of the last century, is giving investors pause. Not because they think these companies will crack, as many did in previous market corrections, but because in the parlance of the industry, the trade has become very crowded. ""There is valuation anxiety out there, that is for sure,"" said Ed Yardeni, an independent investment strategist who often highlights the influence of these stocks in his research notes. ""No one is feeling totally comfortable holding stocks that are this expensive."" Despite some nervousness that a bubble might be building, stock indexes remain near recent record highs, without adjustment for inflation. On Wednesday, stocks ended slightly higher in cautious trading on the eve of several potentially market-moving events on Thursday, including the British election and testimony from James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed up 0.16 percent on Wednesday, led by gains in bank stocks. Other markets have been robust recently, including those for gold, a traditional haven, and the virtual currency Bitcoin. But oil prices and the United States dollar have weakened, with the Bloomberg dollar spot index at its lowest levels since the Nov. 8 election. The stock market, however, remains the main attraction. Late in any bull market, investing in highflying momentum stocks requires balancing greed and fear. Everyone wants to keep making money, but everyone also lives in fear that the party will suddenly end. According to the data provider FactSet, since 2012, mutual fund, pension fund and hedge fund holdings of stock in the five technology giants have more than doubled, to $1.4 trillion, from $558 billion — a consequence of investors' buying up stocks that are rapidly increasing in value. As is its wont, Wall Street has given voice to this unease with a nickname: Faang, an acronym for the five stocks that evokes a gruesome end more than it does the exuberance of the moment. The push into these stocks has been driven by retail investors via traditional mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and direct ownership. Through these channels, retail investors now own 60 to 70 percent of these stocks — an exposure of very large amounts of money to a small selection of stocks that investment specialists say is unprecedented. It is also dangerous because a prolonged bout of selling in such a small number of stocks could spur a wider sell-off in the market. ""In terms of magnitude, we have not seen this,"" said Jim Paulsen, an independent stock market strategist. In Mr. Paulsen's view, a long period of subpar economic growth since 2009 has given the Faang stocks their special aura. Most companies have struggled to show consistent earnings and sales growth over this period. So when Facebook's net earnings leap to $10 billion, from $1.4 billion, in four years or Amazon's sales jump to $135 billion, from $74 billion, investors take notice. ""You have this small cadre of companies that are showing extraordinary growth in a very sluggish economy,"" Mr. Paulsen said. ""So yes, you can see how valuations would get extended."" Stock market historians say it would be unfair to compare today's technology companies to the more speculative names that characterized the dot-com boom and bust. Progress can easily be measured via earnings and the cash-generating abilities these companies have, as opposed to counting eyeballs on the web, which was the norm in that era. Still, the question remains: How much more can the stock market valuations of these companies grow relative to the earnings they produce? For example, the current stock market size of the Faang companies is $2.4 trillion, or about 13 percent of the size of the United States economy. By comparison, their combined earnings were just $77 billion last year — with more than half that amount from Apple, the world's richest company. Of course, in many cases, investors are calculating that in the long term, earnings growth will catch up with sales expansion as well as heavy investment spending aimed at putting competitors out of business. Amazon, whose $2.3 billion in earnings last year supports a market capitalization of $483 billion, is the most profound example in this regard. Still, it is not today's earnings that investors are betting on, but tomorrow's, the argument goes. Surprisingly, some of the most passionate advocates for these companies are value investors. These investment professionals have earned reputations for snapping up companies trading at deep discounts relative to the market, not chasing stocks that fly high above it. Bill Nygren, a value investor for more than 30 years, oversees the $5.8 billion Oakmark Select Fund, and his No. 1 holding in the fund is now Google's parent, Alphabet. Mr. Nygren contends that the company is trading at a bargain to the market, as opposed to a premium, if Google's cash pile and the potential of YouTube to make a lot of money in the future are considered. ""I have not heard anyone advance the argument that the Google search engine is not even an average business,"" Mr. Nygren said. ""Yet that is how the market is pricing it."" Another well-known value manager who is betting big on Faang stocks is Chris Davis, the lead stock picker for the $11.8 billion New York Venture Fund, where Amazon is his top position. While skeptics see just $2 billion in earnings, he and his analysts see a company that has generated more than $15 billion in cash and is ready for a higher market rating because of the profitability of its web services division. ""Amazon is more fully valued than when we bought it,"" Mr. Davis said. ""But we have never seen a company with such competitive advantages."" As these stock prices continue to rise, analysts agree that investors have little choice but to stick to their guns. That is because the Faang stocks have become such large components of the major stock market measures. For a manager not to match the share of an Apple or an Amazon in a benchmark would result in an actively managed fund trailing its index and its peers. And as investors pour billions of dollars into exchange-traded funds — a record $314 billion in the last year — no active manager can afford to lag the competition for too long. So be it a mutual fund, hedge fund, sovereign wealth fund or family office, the strategy has been consistent — put aside any fears, and stay invested. ""It's like you are riding a missile that you know could explode at any moment beneath you,"" said Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research company based in Vail, Colo. He has warned in his reports that some of these stocks have entered a stage of mania. ""But,"" he said, ""you have no choice but to be sucked into the trade."""
2,2017-06-07," What can $50 buy? An inexpensive pair of sneakers, maybe dinner for two in San Francisco or a couple of tickets to the ballgame. But few ever imagined that it could also buy a tablet computer capable of running apps and streaming Netflix. Yet that is what Amazon has delivered with its  Fire tablets, with starting prices of $50 for the seven-inch model and $80 for the eight-incher. The newest versions of these tablets, which are set to be released this week, are unabashedly slow and unflashy — but just capable enough to be worth this meager sum. This low-cost-for-no-frills strategy appears to be working well for the retail giant. Sales of Amazon's touch-screen tablets jumped by double digits last year from a year earlier, the company has said. IDC, the research firm, said low-cost Fires had propelled Amazon to No. 3 in the tablet market, after Apple and Samsung. Amazon's tablet success stands out because sales of the devices as a whole have been shrinking. Slowing tablet sales have compelled Apple to refresh its iPads more frequently than many of its other products. In fact, Apple on Monday introduced yet another new iPad with a 10.5-inch screen and a starting price of $649. After testing Amazon's Fire 7 and Fire HD 8 for a week, here's my verdict: These cheap tablets are ideal for families with children who treat gadgets like toys that can be slammed on a table or thrown against the ground. But if you're an adult who needs to get the slightest amount of work done on a tablet, you should probably spend the extra money on a big-screen smartphone or an iPad. Here's what you need to know about what you get — and what you don't — from a $50 Amazon tablet. The best thing about the new tablets is how they feel to hold. Weighing about 10 ounces and 13 ounces, the seven-inch and eight-inch devices were designed to be easily carried in one hand. After spending hours holding the Fire with one hand to read e-books and to watch Netflix videos, my wrist did not feel strained. The compact size also makes these tablets great for children with small hands. The Fire 7 also had surprisingly long battery life for a device this inexpensive. Amazon says it gets about eight hours of juice while juggling various tasks, like browsing the web and running apps. I watched about four and a half hours of video before its battery drained. That's modest, but enough for playing a feature-length movie before tucking a child into bed. Amazon says the eight-incher has a battery life of 12 hours. While the Fires have mediocre displays with dull colors and noticeable pixelation even when reading e-books, the lower quality is acceptable at this price. I wouldn't use a Fire for reading digital comics, which usually have a wide range of colors and sharp illustrations, but the tablet is sufficient for flipping through e-books, which are just black text on white pages. For internet speeds, the Fires were reasonably fast at downloads. In my tests on a Wi-Fi network, Apple's $329 iPad had download speeds of 92 megabits a second, compared with the Fire 7, at 48 megabits a second. While the Fires were only about half as fast as the pricier iPad, 48 megabits a second was more than enough to smoothly stream video and quickly download apps and e-books. The worst part of the Fires is the overall computing power. The tablets are so slow at loading apps and processing tasks that even typing memos is painful; whenever you make a mistake, there is a lag as you backspace to type the correct letter. The sluggishness also makes the Fires terrible for scrolling through web articles. Don't buy an Amazon tablet if you plan to use it for email, web browsing or playing games with heavy graphics. Another major component lacking from Amazon's tablets is access to Google's official app store, the largest mobile software shop with more than 2.5 million apps. The tablets run a modified version of Google's Android that instead showcases Amazon's App store. While there are hundreds of thousands of apps inside Amazon's app store, I found that some of my favorite apps were missing — namely 1Password, an app for managing passwords. Perhaps the biggest design oversight of the Fire 7 is the placement of the speaker on the back of the tablet. Most other tablets feature the speakers on the bottom or sides so that blockage isn't a problem. But if you place the tablet bottom-side down on a flat surface to listen to music from the speaker, the sound will be muffled. Instead, you have to lay it screen-side down. The same problem occurs if you hold it with a protective cover on: The back flap covers the speaker. (The Fire 8 does not have this problem, because the speakers are on the side.) Lastly, if you pay the bare minimum of $50 for the seven-incher or $80 for the eight-incher, you are getting a tablet that shows ads, or what Amazon calls ""special offers."" What that means is the lock screen, which is what you see when you wake up the device, will shuffle through different ads, like e-book or app promotions. You can pay an extra $15 to buy versions of the tablets without sponsored screens. With all that said, would you pay $50 for an adequate e-book reader and TV show and movie player that was easy to carry around everywhere? My guess would be yes. But perhaps the most compelling value proposition is a hidden one: keeping your child's hands off your fancy iPad."
0,2017-06-08," Just as giant streaming services like Netflix and Amazon have quickly established themselves as movie production entities, resentment and panic from studios and filmmakers (and what some might term a critical peanut gallery) have grown more blatant. At this year's Cannes Film Festival, the 70th, the great Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar, the president of the festival's competition jury, said at a news conference that he couldn't imagine awarding a competition film that would not be shown in a theater. This came shortly after the festival issued a statement saying that in the future its competition section would not consider films that would not be shown theatrically in France. The wording of that statement was ambiguous — some films in the competition come to the festival with no distribution deals in place, so how do you determine their French theatrical future in those cases? As for Mr. Almodóvar's throwdown, it had some unpleasant implications. Would the jury leader effectively blackball the two Netflix movies in competition, Bong Joon-ho's ""Okja"" and Noah Baumbach's ""The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)""? The fun continued into the festival last month, where some members of the news media reportedly booed the Netflix logo at the beginning of ""Okja,"" then booed some more when the first 10 minutes of the movie were projected in the wrong aspect ratio, a glitch that inspired some Infowars-style conspiracy theories on Twitter. Once the movie was shown correctly, it earned an ovation and attendant critical praise on social media. Mr. Baumbach's movie was also warmly received, and in postscreening exchanges with reporters, he enacted what is becoming a very familiar dance, explaining that his movie, while ideally meant to be exhibited on a big screen, benefited substantially from the artistic freedom Netflix had afforded him. (Neither ""Okja"" nor ""Meyerowitz"" took home any awards, as it happened.) While Netflix garnered controversy without actively seeking it, Amazon quietly took Todd Haynes's new movie, ""Wonderstruck,"" to the competition. As of this writing, there was no news of either company's having made major acquisitions at the festival. Efe Cakarel, the founder and chief executive of the streaming service Mubi, which rides hard for cinephile art house fare, told me I shouldn't be too surprised by this. ""The first few years I came to Cannes, all I did was explain to film producers what streaming video on demand even was,"" he told me in a phone interview just after this year's festival (his 10th). ""And if you even broached the idea of acquiring rights to first-run movies for streaming, they looked at you like you were crazy. Remember, Cannes 2007 was right before the introduction of the iPhone. Three years before the iPad. Yes, YouTube was around, but that sort of thing wasn't even close to what YouTube was about then. Although you could tell, by looking at the way people used their laptops, there was a readiness to engage with long-form material."" Mubi acquired its first title from Cannes last year, the charming Finnish period drama ""The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli Maki,"" based on a true story about a boxer and his match with a fearsome American opponent. This year Mubi picked up ""Lover for a Day,"" the latest film from the redoubtable, moody French auteur Philippe Garrel. As Mr. Cakarel notes, though, having the likes of Amazon and Netflix in the production game means that at a festival like Cannes, fewer and fewer films are arriving without a distributor. ""There were 18 films in competition with 13 already bought,"" Mr. Cakarel said. ""Every year it's getting more and more intense, and that's in part because companies such as Netflix and Amazon are part of the Cannes machine, so to speak. They're financing, producing, distributing films, often with an eye to getting them to Cannes. So now we are in the business of negotiating prebuys, too."" So, Mr. Cakarel concluded, ""If you want to work with Paolo Sorrentino, you have to have the conversation with him today, before he's even embarked on whatever he is going to do next."" Mr. Sorrentino recently made a big international splash with a television mini-series, ""The Young Pope,"" rather than a feature film. This year Cannes offered attendees looks at series by two top-drawer film directors and Cannes veterans, Jane Campion and David Lynch. Ms. Campion, whose ""The Piano"" won the Palme d'Or in 1993, showed all six hourlong episodes of ""Top of the Lake: China Girl,"" the second iteration of a mystery series starring Elisabeth Moss (which will air on SundanceTV and stream on Hulu beginning in September), while Mr. Lynch, whose ""Wild at Heart"" won the Palme in 1990, brought the first two hours of ""Twin Peaks,"" a revival of his 1990s ABC prime-time show that is now airing on Showtime. Mr. Lynch, who expressed outrage about a decade back over the very idea of watching a movie on a phone (his words, which included ""are you kidding me"" became a kind of mantra for theatrical-experience purists), is coming back to a form of cinematic storytelling after a long absence. (His last feature film was ""Inland Empire,"" from 2006.) He and others have described the ""Twin Peaks"" revival not as a multiepisode television series but as an 18-hour movie. Judging from what I've seen, it certainly feels like that. And it's such a singular work that it's likely to toss the whole argument for film's superiority over television (or vice versa) out the window, even as the borders between the two media grow sufficiently porous to render the question moot. In any event, movie or television series, it is absolutely available to watch on your phone, courtesy of the Showtime Now app."
1,2017-06-08," If you go to see ""Wonder Woman,"" don't leave your sons at home. Take your daughters too, of course, as you will want them to witness the next-level girl power of the title character and the Amazons who raise her. But the point is not simply to show our children that women can be heroes. The point is to show our daughters and sons alike where true heroes get their strength. The movie begins with an inviting origin story. Wonder Woman, whose real name is Diana, is a demigod raised by warriors on an all-female paradise island. But the story moves from the sunny beach to the Western Front of World War I, where it both darkens and reveals its heart. Wonder Woman marshals her supernatural force behind the single aim of stopping human suffering, which means ending the war. Diana is undeniably tough, but it's her yawning tenderness, not her mythical strength, that sets her apart from the men alongside her and the standard-issue male superhero. In a haunting scene that resonates with the news of our time, she withers when she comes upon the devastation of a gas attack. Wonder Woman's compassion is the fuel of her force. She's not bowed down by anguish; she's pulled back like a catapult. That Wonder Woman unleashes her wrath only when she's exposed to inhumanity raises a question that belongs at our dinner tables: What is the purpose of having power? You can't spend time on a playground or in a classroom (or in a boardroom or a war room) without having to grapple with this one. Making ""Wonder Woman"" a full-family experience can open conversations with our children about how they might use their own influence. Would our daughters and sons stand passively by if they saw someone being bullied? Or would they use their own power to stick up for those who have less of it? Not surprisingly, the film has plenty of examples of sexism. For instance, when Diana dares to crash an all-male meeting, an appalled commander demands to know ""Who is this woman?"" Parents can use this to talk about gender politics unfolding in our children's schools. Frustratingly persistent evidence shows that males continue to dominate the airtime of coeducational classes, even in college and law school, and even when females are in the majority. To achieve equity in classroom participation, we need to continue to encourage our young women to speak up. Further, we need to remind our daughters and our sons to use their leverage as Diana would: To stand up to those who interrupt girls or prevent them from speaking, especially interrupters who are flexing their privilege. To be clear, guys aren't alone in riding roughshod over their peers. But the common cultural responses to female and male aggression reveal a double standard. Young women who abuse their social power are often given the hard-to-shake label of ""mean girls,"" while similar behavior among young men is often ignored, because ""boys will be boys."" When we stop instinctively dismissing male aggression and at the same time slow our judgmental reactions to what we view as female aggression, we can have fair conversations with our children about how power should be exercised. We can ask whether it's O.K. for boys to tease one another, or for a child to watch a boy be teased and say nothing. And we can wonder if a young woman might be penalized for assertive behavior that is routinely overlooked in young men, and what actions should be considered out of bounds for anyone. Our children won't face the epic evildoers of the DC Comics world, but they will certainly encounter, or flirt with being, pint-size tyrants. Those who seek to abuse power offer one model of how force can be employed. ""Wonder Woman"" offers another. Diana serves up a welcome example of a leader who draws her strength from her humanity, and uses it only to protect herself or to defend others. In this respect, we should all want for our daughters to be like Wonder Woman, and our sons, too."
0,2017-06-09," Q. Where do I find the dimensions of a digital photo on my computer? Amazon's photofinishing service says the pictures need a resolution of ""450 by 630"" for a five-by-seven-inch print. A. Even if you do not have a photo-editing program that displays the picture's resolution and other information, you can quickly see the width and height (measured in pixels) of a selected photo with the computer's operating system. On a Windows PC, for example, hovering the mouse over an image thumbnail should display the photo's dimensions in the pop-up Info Tip box. On a Mac, the information is displayed under a preview of the picture when you click on the file in the Finder's ""column view,"" which you can select from the View menu in the Finder. The photo's pixel dimensions and other embedded data — like the file format and size, exposure setting, and type of camera used to take it — can be seen in the picture's Properties or Info box. On a PC, right-click on the file, select Properties from the menu and click on the Details tab in the Properties box. On a Mac, right-click (or hold down the Control key and click) the image thumbnail and choose Get Info. Photo-processing sites list minimum pixel dimensions and other requirements for the pictures you upload so that the finished prints are as sharp and clear as possible. Digital images that are too small will look blurry and jagged on paper, so be sure your files meet the site's guidelines. If possible, it is best to use photos that have been imported from the camera, as pictures that were emailed or downloaded from sharing sites may have been converted to a lower resolution to reduce the file size. Amazon's Photo Quality Tips page has a list of optimal photo resolutions based on the print size or project you want to produce from your digital images, as does Shutterfly and other photo-printing sites. For further reading on the topic, the online Adobe Photoshop User Guide has a detailed explanation of pixel dimensions and printed image resolution, and the Digital Photography School site has a tutorial of its own."
1,2017-06-09," Taylor Swift is returning her music catalog to streaming services, ending the digital music world's highest-profile feud and affirming that streaming is now the dominant music format. On Thursday evening, Ms. Swift's management announced on Twitter that since her latest album, ""1989,"" has now sold 10 million copies around the world, she ""wants to thank her fans by making her entire back catalog available to all streaming services tonight at midnight."" For Spotify in particular, Ms. Swift's return has great symbolic significance. Shortly after she released ""1989,"" in October 2014, Ms. Swift removed her entire catalog from Spotify, saying later, ""I'm not willing to contribute my life's work to an experiment that I don't feel fairly compensates the writers, producers, artists and creators of this music."" It was the highest-profile protest at a moment when many artists were highly suspicious of streaming, and concerned that the new format would erode their sales of CDs and downloads. The next year, Ms. Swift battled publicly with Apple over the introduction of Apple Music, Spotify's streaming competitor. Her public criticism led the company to change its royalty policy overnight. But Ms. Swift's return is a sign of the dominance of streaming, and of its maturation as an essential part of the music business, from the marketing of singles to the industry's sales figures. In March, the Recording Industry Association of America, a trade group, reported that in 2016 streaming services generated $3.9 billion in sales in the United States, representing 51 percent of revenues. Spotify, which operates both free and paid tiers, had for years staunchly refused requests from record labels and artists — including, apparently, Ms. Swift — to restrict music to its paid levels, which pay higher royalties. But this year, in a renegotiation with the Universal Music Group, the world's largest music conglomerate, Spotify agreed to let labels put new music only on the paid tier for limited periods, in exchange for lower royalty rates. Ms. Swift's music is returning to all major streaming services, including Spotify, Amazon and Google Play, and will be on both free and paid levels of Spotify. (Her music is already on Apple Music, which has also financed a concert film for her and put her in commercials.) On Twitter, some listeners also nursed a darker intention to Ms. Swift's timing: Tonight is also when Katy Perry, her biggest pop rival, is releasing a new album."
0,2017-06-11," SEATTLE — Amazon's warehouses have a reputation as often grueling environments for the workers who pick, pack and load orders there. Managers are pushed hard, too, according to the plaintiff in a new lawsuit against the internet retailer. The lawsuit, filed this month by Michael Ortiz, a former shift manager for Amazon in several warehouses in the San Francisco Bay Area, accuses Amazon of failing to pay him overtime wages. The suit, filed in Contra Costa County Superior Court, says that Amazon improperly classified Mr. Ortiz as exempt from overtime in violation of California labor regulations. Mr. Ortiz's lawyer, Scott Cole, said he would seek class-action status for the suit with the addition of other plaintiffs. Kristen Kish, an Amazon spokeswoman, said the company would not comment on pending litigation. While most of the entry-level workers at Amazon's warehouses, known as associates, are eligible for overtime pay, salaried managers are not under Amazon policy. In an interview, Mr. Ortiz, 34, said he and other managers had been promised when they were hired that their jobs would consist mostly of supervisory work. Instead, most of his job ended up being manual labor, some of it dangerous, he said. ""When we were hired, we were told we would be managers working on high-end things,"" Mr. Ortiz said. ""In reality, the bulk of the managers got stuck doing very tedious work which ultimately caused me to be injured."" There have been other cases in which workers have argued that Amazon improperly denied them overtime. In 2014, the United States Supreme Court ruled unanimously that Amazon warehouse workers were not entitled to overtime pay for the time they spent waiting to pass through security screenings, which are used to deter theft. Cases such as Mr. Ortiz's are more common and could have a better chance of success, especially in California, which is among the states regarded as having the most employee-friendly labor laws in the country. In California, the burden of proof is on employers to show that workers should not receive overtime pay, which they can do by demonstrating that more than half of a manager's job consisted of managerial responsibilities, labor lawyers said. ""Amazon faces a heavy burden to show that the workers truly fit within the narrow exemption to overtime pay that the California Legislature established,"" said Jahan Sagafi, a lawyer at Outten & Golden in San Francisco who represents workers in lawsuits against employers, but is not involved in Mr. Ortiz's case. ""Just assigning them managerial-sounding work may not be enough, depending on how much they do and what it entails, exactly."" Mr. Ortiz was working as a shift manager at an Amazon delivery station in Richmond, Calif. He said he had worked for Amazon for about 11 months until he was terminated last December after he slipped and cut his eye while climbing on a conveyor belt to free up a jam of packages. Standing on a conveyor belt is a violation of Amazon policy. Mr. Ortiz said his supervisor encouraged him to report that he had fallen on the stairs and that he had later been fired by Amazon when witness accounts conflicted with his version of events. Mr. Ortiz first spoke to a reporter for The New York Times early this year, not long after his injury. At the time, Mr. Ortiz said a friend and colleague in the same facility at Amazon had sustained the injury, not him. In a phone interview after filing the suit, Mr. Ortiz apologized for the deception, saying that at the time of his first contact he was appealing his termination at the company. ""There was a small chance that I would be able to keep my job, so that is why I had to distance myself from the story,"" he said."
1,2017-06-11," We are again nearing what appear to be all-time highs in the stock market, and when that happens, people tend to say and do strange things. This time around, Amazon, Apple, Google (in the form of its parent company, Alphabet), Microsoft and Netflix are worth $2.4 trillion all on their own, accounting for 13 percent of the entire American economy.

Well, then it's time to rethink just how much risk your brain is set to bear — and whether you need safer investments to put it at rest.

0,2017-06-15," You're an astronomically wealthy tech mogul who has mastered the art of getting people to spend money with your company over the internet. How do you come up with fresh ideas for giving some of your fortune away? If you're Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon.com, you fire up Twitter, naturally. On Thursday, Mr. Bezos sent a tweet to his more than 222,000 followers asking for suggestions for philanthropic giving. He specifically asked for ideas that could help the world in the near term, a contrast to long-term personal investments he has made in for-profit companies with social impact, like Blue Origin, a space firm, and The Washington Post. Mr. Bezos wrote, ""I'm thinking I want much of my philanthropic activity to be helping people in the here and now — short term — at the intersection of urgent need and lasting impact."" As an example of the kind of near-term effort he has in mind, Mr. Bezos singled out a commitment Amazon recently made to provide a homeless shelter for families, Mary's Place, with a permanent home in a new Amazon office building that will be built starting later this year. The prospect of someone with Mr. Bezos's wealth — he is the second-richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with a fortune of well over $80 billion — increasing his giving was greeted enthusiastically by people who work in philanthropy. His approach is unusual compared with many big philanthropists from the technology field, like Bill Gates, a founder of Microsoft, whose foundation has tackled long-term global health problems like malaria, among other challenges. ""I would call it surprising, but welcome,"" said Jacob Harold, the president of Guidestar, a national database of nonprofits. ""It's rare for big-dollar donors to be honest about their desire for short-term results."" Mr. Harold said that he ""would be worried if every donor was saying this,"" but that Mr. Bezos's approach could have a meaningful effect. Mr. Bezos did not say on Twitter how much money he planned to commit to philanthropic giving. Given the magnitude of his wealth and the generosity of others in technology like Mr. Gates, his philanthropy has been relatively modest. He and his family have donated $15 million to Princeton University, his alma mater, and recently gave $35 million to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, the largest donation in that institution's history. Mr. Bezos has also characterized Blue Origin, the for-profit space company that he is funding with about $1 billion of his wealth annually, as an effort to help save Earth in the long run by providing means to move heavy industry off the planet. Mr. Bezos asked people to reply to his post with their ideas. A little more than five hours after his request, there were more than 3,600 such replies, including suggestions for contributing to affordable housing, veterans' organizations and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender causes. Larry Brilliant, the acting chairman of the Skoll Global Threats Fund, a philanthropy created by Jeff Skoll, one of eBay's founders, said that crowdsourcing philanthropic ideas had had mixed success in large part because of the challenge of identifying ones that have promise. ""The denominator of ideas you will get in, the vast majority of ideas which are not good, not viable, will flood this process,"" said Mr. Brilliant, who formerly ran Google's philanthropic arm."
1,2017-06-15," Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, is well on his way to becoming the richest person in the world, with a net worth of more than $80 billion. What's less certain is what he plans to do with his fortune, and how he could reinvent philanthropy. On Thursday, after questions from The New York Times about the level of his giving, Mr. Bezos posted on Twitter a ""request for ideas"" for philanthropy. ""I'm thinking about a philanthropy strategy that is the opposite of how I mostly spend my time — working on the long term,"" he wrote. ""For philanthropy, I find I'm drawn to the other end of the spectrum: the right now."" Citing a homeless program in Seattle, Amazon's hometown, that the company is working with, he said he was seeking to help people ""at the intersection of urgent need and lasting impact,"" adding, ""If you have any ideas, just reply to this tweet..."" The message was classic Bezos — challenging conventional wisdom, seeking the wisdom of the market and highlighting his various businesses. Yet it failed to answer a question that is likely to follow him more often if and when he becomes the richest man: What are his plans to give away some or all of his wealth? Mr. Bezos, who owns about 17 percent of Amazon, has enjoyed what could be the most rapid personal-wealth surge in history. As Amazon's share price has more than tripled since 2015, its leader has added more than $50 billion to his net worth, bringing his current total to nearly $83 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He is now less than $7 billion shy of taking the title of the world's richest person from Bill Gates, who has held the crown for 18 of the past 23 years. Mr. Bezos' wealth is proof of Amazon's seemingly unstoppable growth and dominance in a wide range of fields, including online retailing and cloud computing. It adds another Horatio Alger story to the mythmaking machine of American wealth — showcasing someone from the middle class who was adopted by his Cuban-immigrant stepfather, quit his Wall Street job to start selling books online from his garage and created a company now worth nearly a half trillion dollars. Yet until Thursday, his philanthropy remained largely a mystery. He is the only one of the top five billionaires in America who has not signed the Giving Pledge, the promise created by Mr. Gates and Warren Buffett for the superrich to give away at least half of their wealth. He has never appeared on the Philanthropy 50, a list of America's 50 largest donors, that is published yearly by The Chronicle of Philanthropy. According to public data and news reports, Mr. Bezos and his family have bestowed around $100 million in total on charities — about one-tenth of 1 percent of his fortune. He has not created a personal foundation for making charitable gifts, according to databases that track nonprofits. Although he sits on the board of the Bezos Family Foundation and his parents, Mike and Jackie Bezos, run it, Mr. Bezos' name doesn't appear anywhere on its website. He and his wife, MacKenzie, did give $15 million in 2015 to Princeton University, their alma mater. The Bezos family — including Jeff and MacKenzie, his parents and his siblings — recently donated $35 million to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. Before that, they made two donations, totaling $30 million, to the center. In 2011, Mr. Bezos donated $10 million dollars to Seattle's Museum of History and Industry. And last month, Mr. Bezos gave $1 million to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. His purchase of The Washington Post in 2013 for $250 million was seen by many as a form of philanthropy — using his wealth to support important journalism — but The Post is a for-profit business. He has said that his space exploration company, Blue Origin, aims to save Earth by putting industry in space, but it, too, is a for-profit venture. Still, Mr. Bezos has never said publicly what he plans to do with his fortune, what causes he might support or even whether he will give away some or most of it. ""The pressure on Bezos to step up is going to grow if he becomes the richest man,"" said David Callahan, the founder and editor of Inside Philanthropy, a philanthropy information site. ""It's a little surprising it hasn't grown already."" Mr. Bezos declined to comment for this article. His Twitter invitation on Thursday came after repeated questions on Wednesday from The Times about his giving levels and the lack of public information on his philanthropy. A spokesman declined to comment on whether the queries prompted the post. The Twitter post — while offering the most insight so far about his philanthropy thinking — did not commit to any funding levels or to creating a foundation or an L.L.C., as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and other billionaires have done. Experts on nonprofits and friends of Mr. Bezos say he has been more focused on building Amazon and would probably turn to philanthropy later. The more wealth he creates today, they said, the more he can give away later. Granted, money has never been Mr. Bezos' public goal. Like many of today's tech tycoons, he has said his mission is changing the world and satisfying customers rather than getting rich. In a commencement speech at Princeton in 2010, he recounted his choice to quit his comfortable job in finance in 1994 to take a risk on selling books online. ""I took the less safe path to follow my passion,"" he said, ""and I'm proud of that choice."" He does enjoy some of the trappings of being a billionaire. Last fall, he bought the most expensive home ever sold in Washington, D.C., when he paid $23 million for the former Textile Museum, which he plans to turn into a single-family residence. Aside from his main residence in Seattle, he has a $24 million home in Beverly Hills, Calif., and a ranch in Texas. He is one of the largest landowners in America, with nearly 300,000 acres. Yet Mr. Bezos has so far refused the kind of charitable pledges common among billionaires today. The Bezoses' giving has largely been a family affair, with Mr. Bezos' role hard to determine. Nonprofit experts said the Bezos Family Foundation, while funded with Amazon stock, is mainly led by Mr. Bezos' mother. The foundation has given away tens of millions of dollars, mainly to causes related to child brain development and early education. It's typical, of course, for the wealthy to shift to philanthropy later in life. Mr. Gates was accused of not being charitable enough before he became the richest man in 1995, with a fortune of $12.9 billion. By the end of the 1990s, he had given away more than $2 billion through foundations he created that focused on health and technology. Then, in 1999, he ramped up his giving just before stepping down as Microsoft's chief executive and setting up the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, with more than $20 billion in funding. Mr. Bezos and Amazon have stepped up their giving in recent years, after critical coverage in the Seattle press. A 2012 article in The Seattle Times called Amazon a ""virtual no-show in hometown philanthropy,"" but since then, the company has given millions to local institutions and causes. And judging from his Twitter post and conversations with people who know Mr. Bezos, he wants to forge a new path for addressing social problems rather than just writing checks to nonprofits. His desire to get ideas from the public and fund ""here and now"" philanthropy suggests what could be a bold new direction for philanthropy. Mr. Bezos also sees for-profit ventures as a more effective way to solve certain social problems. ""In many cases, for-profit models improve the world more than philanthropy models, if they can be made to work,"" he told Charlie Rose in 2010. ""We know that he hasn't been very receptive to traditional philanthropy,"" said Steve Delfin, a Washington-area philanthropy adviser to companies and wealthy families. ""My guess is that at some point, he will create an innovative new model or a hybrid approach. And maybe, like Amazon, he'll do it better."""

1,2017-06-16," Are you a woman? Have you been a woman? Do you know any women? O.K. Great. Watch the fifth episode of Jill Soloway's ""I Love Dick,"" streaming on Amazon. Right now. You can also watch the four preceding episodes, but you don't have to. Go ahead. I'll wait. Last week, if you ran into me at the theater or the library or the beach at Coney Island, you heard me sell you on this episode, ""A Short History of Weird Girls."" Whip smart, radical, keen and poignant, it is the best 20 minutes of television I've seen in years. Directed by Mx. Soloway, who identifies as nonbinary and prefers gender-neutral pronouns, and written by the playwrights Annie Baker and Heidi Schreck, the episode comprises four monologues in which characters explore how sexual identity has shaped, sharpened and dented their lives. Three women, and one gender-nonconforming character played by Roberta Colindrez, each recite a letter to Dick, here a MacArthur-winning artist and cowboy hobbyist played by Kevin Bacon. As their present-day selves stand in the forefront of the frame narrating their sexual histories, younger versions of them kiss and clutch and ache and blunder in the background. Near the end of her section, the character of Chris, played by Kathryn Hahn, says: ""Sometimes when I walk down the street, I look into the faces of every woman that I pass, and I wonder what she sees. I wonder about the history of her desire."" Watch this episode and you will, too. ""I Love Dick"" is an adaptation of the 1997 book by Chris Kraus, a smart and dizzy work of autofiction, in which a married narrator much like Ms. Kraus details her obsession with a media theorist named Dick. In Mx. Soloway's adaptation, created with Sarah Gubbins, the action has moved to Marfa, Tex., where Chris, an experimental filmmaker, becomes fixated by Dick, who leads an artist's colony and occasionally shears sheep. She writes him a series of hectic, breathless lust letters. The fifth episode doesn't advance the romantic plot; it does something a lot braver, in a manner as formally ambitious as anything on ""Mr. Robot"" or ""Master of None"" or ""The Leftovers."" It insists — here comes the revolutionary part — that sexual identity is crucial to a broader sense of identity, of a piece with emotional and intellectual development. Other episodes in the series play Chris's helpless lust for laughs, but this one takes women's desires seriously in all their convolution and excitement and shame. ""I don't care how you see me,"" Chris tells an imagined Dick. ""I don't care if you want me. It's better that you don't. It's enough that I want you."" Maybe that doesn't sound so world-shattering to you. It does to me. I've spent my adult life as a theater critic, which means accepting that in a lot of what I see, female characters will be relegated to tidy niches (girlfriend or mother, temptress or innocent), the better to tell men's stories. If women's sexual desire is discussed at all, it's usually presented as pathetic (Helena in ""A Midsummer Night's Dream,"" say) or screwy (like Blanche in ""A Streetcar Named Desire""), while what men see and want and do typically drives the action. Often that's O.K. I like men. I like their stories. I'm a big Sam Shepard fan. But seeing women too expansive and untidy for pigeonholing narrate their own lives, well, that's a thrill. So is their demand to be seen as flawed heroes instead of helpmates, sexual subjects as well as sexual objects. Though the format of the ""Dear Dick"" letters might suggest that each woman is defining herself in relation to him, in this episode the objectified Dick is on the sidelines, on a sofa, wearing nothing but a Navajo blanket. (No complaints.) If the stories in ""A Short History of Weird Girls"" feel real, it's because they are. In the ""I Love Dick"" writers' room, staffed exclusively with women and those who don't identify as male or female, writers were asked to share their own sexual experiences. After a week binge-watching films by artists such as Hito Steyerl, Agnès Varda and Chantal Akerman, Ms. Baker and Ms. Schreck assembled those stories into the four monologues. Ms. Baker declined to discuss the episode. (Her most recent play, ""The Antipodes,"" depicts a writers' room, but it's more macho and apocalyptic than intimate.) But Ms. Schreck, who spoke over a latte in a cafe near her Park Slope home and who credits Ms. Baker with the episode's genesis, sees ""A Short History of Weird Girls"" as a deliberate corrective to the television and movies she saw as a teenager and a young woman. A fan of horror films, she ""associated trying sex with getting killed, from the time I was probably 13 or 14,"" she said. ""Growing up, almost all the sex scenes I saw were made by men, written by men,"" she said. ""I couldn't find myself in there. I was always craving sex scenes that felt like what sex was to me."" Ms. Schreck, who used at least one of her own stories in the Chris section, said that the ""I Love Dick"" episode ""was a great experiment in allowing sexuality to feel as unpredictable and varied as it does in your own psyche."" (I should note that Ms. Schreck, who is also an actress, appeared in one of the oddest and funniest sexual situations that's ever lodged in my psyche, in Erin Courtney's 2004 stage comedy, ""Demon Baby."" I should also note that she recently sold a series based on Mary Gaitskill's ""Bad Behavior,"" another work that takes female sexuality seriously, to the Sundance Channel.) Mx. Soloway, speaking by phone from Los Angeles, described feeling ""a little bit scared"" upon seeing the script and its heavy use of voice-over. Then Mx. Soloway began ""to imagine this episode as these women giving their testimonies in the court of the world"" and decided to submit it as the show's directing entry for this year's Emmy Awards, in part to encourage the thousands of members of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences to watch it, too. ""You reel a little bit after watching it,"" Mx. Soloway said. ""You just kind of go: 'What was that? Was that an episode of television? What did I just see?'"" If we're being writers'-room honest, I don't love everything about the episode. There's some confusion as to when and why the present-day women stand apart from their histories and when they embed themselves in flashbacks. It's also unclear whether the glowing blur that occasionally overtakes them (a homage to Naomi Uman's experimental film ""Removed"") represents sexual desire or a more comprehensive sense of identity. But when I watched it, it made me reel. When I streamed it again, more reeling. Dear Dick, Thanks."
2,2017-06-16," Hey, did you hear the one about organic drones? When Amazon announced on Friday that it would buy the grocery retailer Whole Foods for more than $13 billion, the news that one business behemoth would be swallowing another was too juicy for the armchair comics of Twitter and Facebook to let pass without comment. It is the custom of internet life in the 21st century to compete for likes, shares and retweets with wry or snarky comments on the news. Amazon's latest acquisition was no exception. Whole Foods has long been a punch line for people uncomfortable with everything the organic retailer represents. A bourgeois supermarket that caters to people for whom good old Tropicana orange juice just isn't good enough, not when there's juice that's been squeezed by hand from organic oranges plucked from a sun-dappled field by magical unicorns who are raised in only the most humane ways. What's an extra few dollars when you're rushing off to yoga? (Sometimes the company has made the joke too easy. Two years ago, for instance, a Whole Foods in California put three stalks of asparagus in a plastic tub full of water, and tried to charge $5.99 for ""asparagus water."" The product was pulled from the shelf pretty quickly, after a day of ridicule.) And Amazon, along with its founder, chairman and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, has been developing a reputation as a benevolent ruler of modern mass consumption. The online retailer has succeeded by being an extremely convenient way to buy nearly anything and have it delivered with startling speed, even though there might be a little discomfort about the carbon footprint and the closing of beloved bookshops. But at least, customers could rationalize that. Mr. Bezos was using his fortune to pay for great journalism at The Washington Post, along with some charitable work. And fans of innovation do seem to enjoy his company's experiments with talking cylinders for the home and drone deliveries. But underneath all that there are hints of a darker narrative, one where employees face grim pressures. It's a bit like Loki and Deadpool going into the avocado business. It's just the sort of dystopian comedy the internet loves on a Friday. The comments generally fell into four groups. ""For that price, what'd they get? Two bags of granola?,"" wrote Kevin Ridder on Facebook under The New York Times's report of the sale. ""I too have spent $13.7 billion at Whole Foods Market but somehow I only have a half used container of Almond Milk to show for it,"" wrote Penton Tabitha on Facebook. ""Jeffrey, Based on your recent purchase, you may also be interested in: - Wegmans - Trader Joe's - Kroger"" Wrote Romeo Papa on The New York Times."
3,2017-06-16," We're following major market developments throughout the day. Stock in the upscale supermarket chain Whole Foods surged Friday morning after the announcement of its $13.4 billion sale to Amazon. Shares in other grocery giants and retailers plummeted. Stock in Whole Foods rose 27.6 percent. Kroger dropped 13.2 percent and United Natural Foods fell 15.6 percent. Despite announcing a $310 million deal this morning with the men's clothing company Bonobos, Walmart fell 5.4 percent. Target was also down 8.8 percent. • European Union finance ministers meet in Luxembourg a day after E.U. officials agreed to unlock 8.5 billion euros, or $9.5 billion, for Greece to ensure it meets a huge debt payment next month. • The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Robert Kaplan, will deliver a speech in Dallas at 12:45 p.m. Eastern time. • The Bank of Japan held its benchmark interest rate steady, but signaled that it was confident an economic recovery was gaining momentum. • Don't forget to read the DealBook Morning Agenda. Société Générale said on Friday that the initial public offering of ALD, its auto leasing and fleet management arm, raised 1.16 billion euros, or about $1.3 billion. The offering of 80.8 million shares, or about 20 percent of the company, was priced at €14.30 a share, Société Générale said. Shares of ALD rose 1.6 percent in early trading in Paris on Friday. ""We are delighted with the success of the I.P.O. of ALD, which is a key milestone for the strategic development of our subsidiary,"" Frédéric Oudéa, the French bank's chief executive, said in a news release. Société Générale has said that the listing would allow ALD to gain greater visibility, as well as better capacity to pursue growth opportunities in the corporate and business-to-consumer markets. — CHAD BRAY"
4,2017-06-16," Shares of Walmart, Target, Kroger and Costco, the largest grocery retailers, all tumbled on Friday. And no wonder. Grocery stores have spent the last several years fighting against online and overseas entrants. But now, with its $13.4 billion purchase of Whole Foods, Amazon has effectively started a supermarket war. Armed with giant warehouses, shopper data, the latest technology and nearly endless funds — and now with Whole Foods' hundreds of physical stores — Amazon is poised to reshape an $800 billion grocery market that is already undergoing many changes. And much of the battle is expected to take place online, Amazon's home turf. ""This shows that online is going to be very dominant in the grocery business — and very quickly,"" said Errol Schweizer, a former Whole Foods executive. The grocery business is facing a slew of upstart companies trying to figure out how to make a business of getting food on the kitchen table. Instacart delivers food from grocery stores to doorsteps, while FreshDirect delivers from its own warehouse. Blue Apron delivers boxes of food packaged to make meals. In addition, Lidl and Aldi, two European discount grocers, have recently announced enormous expansions in the United States. Aldi plans to invest $3.4 billion to grow from 1,600 stores to 2,500 stores by 2022, while Lidl, which recently opened a handful of locations, plans to operate 100 by the middle of next year. They are taking on a handful of major companies that have dominated the grocery market. Walmart supercenters, Kroger, Safeway and Publix accounted for about 36 percent of the market in 2013, according to the most recent data from the United States Department of Agriculture. While the grocery giants have been under attack, they have advantages of their own. Walmart has 4,500 stores, for example, compared with the 460 Whole Foods, putting it in far more markets. Walmart has also tried to move swiftly into e-commerce, setting up grocery pickup at many stores. A spokesman for Walmart, Randy Hargrove, said the company felt ""great"" about its ""fast-growing"" e-commerce and online grocery businesses. But even before the deal, many of the stores have been showing signs of stress. On Thursday, shares in Kroger fell nearly 19 percent after the company lowered its guidance. On Friday, the company put on a strong face. ""As we've done in the past, we will evolve our business to deliver what our customers want and need today and into the future,"" Kristal Howard, a spokeswoman for Kroger, said in an email. Whole Foods has had its own struggles. Once a pioneer of the organic foods movement, Whole Foods has more recently struggled to shed its image as too pricey, too upscale and too out-of-touch with customers who want more natural foods at more affordable prices. It recently overhauled its board, and Gabrielle Sulzberger, a private equity executive who is married to Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., the chairman and publisher of The New York Times, was named the company's chairwoman. In recent years, competitors moved into its niche. Kroger and Albertsons have bulked up their organic offerings, and organic food has been one of the strongest areas of growth in the grocery business: Last month, the Organic Trade Association announced that sales of organics had increased by 8.4 percent to $43.3 billion, or more than 5 percent of grocery sales. But with Amazon, the equation changes entirely. It is unclear how Amazon will use Whole Foods, as the company would not go into detail about its plans. Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, is known for making unconventional decisions. But he is also known for having big ambitions, and that could mean a more frontal assault on Walmart — a face-off between the old and the new dominant forces in the retail world. Any heated competition among retailers could be a win for consumers who will be able to pick up their organic sugar beets from Canada, fresh turbot from the North Atlantic and papayas from Guatemala at ever-cheaper prices. And Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods may allow the e-commerce giant to court a much different customer. Walmart's vast rural footprint often allows it to be the cheapest option in town, while Whole Foods' stores are in more affluent areas. Amazon recently began to creep into an important part of Walmart's turf — low-income customers — when it slashed the price of its Amazon Prime membership for people with electronic benefits transfer cards, which people on food stamps and other government assistance programs use. Those customers pay $5.99 a month rather than the $10.99 a month or $99 a year other customers pay for Prime, which provides free two-day shipping, streaming video and other benefits. The deal could also help solidify Amazon's existing grocery business. The company's strategy could be ""as much defensive as it is offensive,"" said Burt P. Flickinger III, managing director of Strategic Resource Group, a global consulting firm. Mr. Flickinger recently returned from a research trip to Britain, where he said Lidl had significantly ""slowed down"" Amazon's growth. ""Shoppers, vendors, people with whom we talked across the country said that Lidl literally transformed everybody's standard of living, whether they shopped at Lidl or not,"" he said. ""They either stopped shopping at Amazon, or they shopped a lot less."" As the supermarket war heats up, some grocery store chains, analysts said, may recognize they cannot compete in a grocery store price war. ""The bottom-tier operators are either going to have to close stores or they're going to get sold to the next bigger guy in order to stay alive,"" said Mickey Chadha, an analyst at Moody's Corporation. Morton Williams, a chain of upscale grocery stores in New York, has already adjusted to newer digital delivery services like Fresh Direct and Instacart. But now, executives fear how Amazon could use its digital expertise to expand Whole Foods in Manhattan. ""Fresh Direct and Instacart are already factored into our numbers,"" said Avi Kaner, the co-owner of Morton Williams. ""The thing that could result in greater risk to us is if Amazon invested in the Whole Foods locations in Manhattan to make them more delivery-centric."" Tim Hayduk, 46, likes to shop at the Morton Williams near his office and also enjoys the sense of community that independent grocery stores engender. Now, he worries that more will disappear, as grocery stores big and small compete in an increasingly cluttered market. ""It's sad to see the mom and pops disappear,"" Mr. Hayduk said ""The neighborhood grocery store is really important. You need a quick and easy place."""
5,2017-06-16," (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good evening. Here's the latest. 1. President Trump lashed out at the deputy attorney general over the investigation into Russian election meddling. Acknowledging for the first time publicly that he is under investigation, Mr. Trump appeared to accuse Rod Rosenstein, above, of leading what the president called a ""witch hunt."" We obtained a memo showing that members of Mr. Trump's transition team were ordered to preserve materials related to the investigation. The administration also released new memos stating that it would allow ""Dreamers,"" or undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, to stay — for now. _____ 2. In a speech in Miami, President Trump announced that he was revoking parts of the ""terrible and misguided"" Obama-era policy of rapprochement with Cuba. Arguing that the détente had enriched the Cuban military, Mr. Trump said he would reinstate travel and commercial restrictions to force concessions from the Castro government. But the reversal could hurt small businesses on the island too. There were mixed reactions in Miami's Little Havana. _____ 3. ""Will they send a drone to remove my wallet?"" The news that Amazon is buying Whole Foods for $13.4 billion inspired legions of armchair comics on social media. And we asked Amazon's founder about his philanthropic plans. Jeff Bezos, who is on his way to becoming the richest person in the world, then took to Twitter to solicit ideas. _____ 4. Russia says it might have killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, above, in an airstrike in the Syrian desert. The strike occurred on May 28 outside Raqqa, and the Russian military says it also killed 30 field commanders and as many as 300 fighters. But rumors of Mr. Baghdadi's death have circulated before, and the Pentagon said it had no indication that this one was true. _____ 5. Anger surged over the government's response to the Grenfell Tower fire in London. Hundreds are homeless and the death toll stands at 30, a figure that could rise to 70. The police said they were opening a criminal investigation to determine if negligence had led to the blaze. Among the first victims to be identified: Mohammed Alhajali, a 23-year-old Syrian refugee, above, who had reached Europe by sea. _____ 6. ""My son loved this city, and this city killed my son. And a murderer gets away."" That was Valerie Castile, above, the mother of Philando Castile, whose name became known around the world when he was fatally shot by a police officer — and his girlfriend streamed the aftermath on Facebook Live. The Minnesota police officer, Jeronimo Yanez, was acquitted of second-degree manslaughter and endangering safety by discharging a firearm. _____ 7. A young woman in Massachusetts was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter for urging her boyfriend to kill himself. Michelle Carter, who was 17 at the time of Conrad Roy III's suicide, faces up to 20 years in prison. It was a rare legal finding that, essentially, a person's words alone can directly cause someone else's suicide. _____ 8. Helmut Kohl, the leader who reunified Germany, died at 87. Mr. Kohl was chancellor from 1982 to 1998. He was remembered as a giant of epochal times that redrew Europe's political architecture and dismantled the minefields and watchtowers of the Iron Curtain. _____ 9. ""We wanted to be somewhere different, see something different."" That was the prevailing sentiment at Flint Northwestern High School in Michigan when the time came to plan the prom. The students wanted to escape their anxiety about the city's water crisis, poverty and gun violence. They donned elaborate, color-coordinated outfits for their milestone bash, aboard a riverboat in Detroit. Some had never been to the city before, though it's only an hour away. _____ 10. If you've seen the buddy movie ""The Hangover,"" you have basically seen ""Rough Night,"" starring Scarlett Johansson, our critic says. (She doesn't think that's a good thing.) The movie, about a bachelorette party weekend gone wrong, flips the gender roles, but leaves the cliché-ridden script intact. Instead, you might consider the latest Pixar movie, ""Cars 3,"" which is ""both breezy fun and a pain-free life lesson delivery vehicle"" for adults as well as children. _____ 11. Finally, the late-night hosts riffed on President Trump's assertion that the Russia investigation is a ""WITCH HUNT."" ""Yes, it's just like the Salem witch trials,"" Stephen Colbert joked.

6,2017-06-16," Led by co-founder John Mackey, Whole Foods Market quickly grew from a small store in Austin, Tex., to the largest natural-foods supermarket chain in the United States. But as organic foods grew in popularity, Whole Foods was squeezed by lower-cost grocery rivals. 1978: Born in Austin Mr. Mackey, 25, co-founded Safer Way Natural Foods, a 2,000-square-foot store in Austin, Tex., with his then girlfriend. 1980: First Whole Foods Market Mr. Mackey joined his rival Clarksville Natural Grocery to open the first Whole Foods Market, with 19 employees. A year later, the store was nearly destroyed in a flood. It reopened within a month thanks to the rebuilding efforts of employees and Austin residents. 1984: Expansion Begins The company's expansion began with the opening of a store in Houston. Within a year, Whole Foods Market had about 600 workers. 1988: Beyond the Lone Star State Whole Foods Market expanded outside of Texas with the acquisition of the similarly named Whole Food Company of New Orleans. It was the company's sixth store. Whole Foods's early growth came largely from mergers and acquisitions. 1992: From Austin to Wall Street Now operating 12 stores in Texas, California, North Carolina and Louisiana, Whole Foods Market went public. The prospectus stated that ""a significant segment of the population now attributes added value to high quality natural food."" Marian Burros, a food reporter for The New York Times, wrote that ""these gleaming new supermarkets — 13,000 to 27,000 square feet of floor space — bear about as much resemblance to the grungy, 1960s fern-bedecked natural food co-op, with its shriveled produce and flour stored in trash cans, as McDonald's does to Lutèce."" Later that year, the company expanded into the Northeast with the purchase of the Boston-based supermarket chain Bread and Circus. 1996: From Hippie to Hip Capitalist Whole Foods acquired Fresh Fields, a Maryland-based chain with 22 stores. Mr. Mackey's natural foods empire now consisted of 70 stores in 16 states. While still small compared to traditional supermarket chains, the natural and organic foods company grew at more than 20 percent a year. The next year, revenue surpassed $1 billion. 1997: Whole Foods, Whole Paycheck Whole Foods started its store brand, 365 Everyday Value. The private label was later used to combat the perception that Whole Foods, sometimes known as ""Whole Paycheck"" for its notoriously high prices, was too expensive for everyday people. 2002: Fighting Unions Mr. Mackey says he is pro-employee, but anti-union. In Madison, Wis., workers voted to unionize, a victory that was later decertified. Mr. Mackey told The Times that the vote came from his inattention to worker concerns. The following year, he visited all the Whole Foods stores in the United States to bond with employees. 2004: Manhattan's Largest Supermarket Whole Foods, which already operated a 40,000-square-foot store in Chelsea, opened its flagship 58,000-square-foot store in the basement of the Time Warner Center. On opening day, a line stretched out the door. 2006: Wall Street and Foodies Grow Disillusioned Critics began to complain that Whole Foods was straying from its roots. The newer stores focus on prepared food and include in-store restaurants and spas. Bruised by competition with traditional grocery stores, the stock dropped by nearly 40 percent. 2007: An Ill-Fated Merger The Federal Trade Commission challenged the acquisition of Wild Oats, claiming that the deal would create a natural-foods monopoly. The F.T.C. discovered that Mr. Mackey had used a pseudonym to write anonymous blog posts attacking Wild Oats. ""The end game is now under way for OATS,"" Mr. Mackey wrote in one. ""Whole Foods is systematically destroying their viability as a business market by market, city by city."" Two years later, Whole Foods agreed to sell 13 stores to resolve the complaint. 2008: Selling a Stake to a Private Investor Squeezed by the financial crisis and traditional grocery stores, Whole Foods stock plummeted 76 percent in one year. The company sold a 17 percent stake to Green Equity Investors, an affiliate of Los Angeles-based private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners. 2009: Obamacare and a Boycott Mr. Mackey wrote an Op-Ed in The Wall Street Journal quoting Margaret Thatcher and arguing that ""the last thing our country needs is a massive new health care entitlement."" His company's liberal-minded customers responded with a boycott. 2013: The G.M.O. Label Whole Foods became the first retailer in the United States to label all genetically modified foods. The company's stock peaked at $65.24. 2015: Wall Street Sours Wall Street analysts grew increasingly negative as organic food became cheaper and more popular at big supermarket chains. ""Conventional retailers can get it into their stores more cheaply, and they can be more predatory on pricing,"" Mark Retzloff, a pioneer of the natural and organic foods retail business, told The Times. ""If one of those stores is just down the street from a Whole Foods, there's a big segment of their customer base that isn't going to shop at Whole Foods anymore."" 2017: Under Hedge Fund Duress After the activist hedge fund Jana Partners took a stake in Whole Foods and pushed for change, the company overhauled its board in May and began a push to cut costs. Gabrielle Sulzberger, a private equity executive who is married to Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., the chairman and publisher of The New York Times, became chairwoman. In an interview with Texas Monthly published on June 14, Mr. Mackey criticized activist investors. ""It's the idea that business is about a bunch of greedy bastards running around exploiting people, screwing their customers, taking advantage of their employees, dumping their toxic waste in the environment, acting like sociopaths,"" he said. Two days later, Amazon agreed to buy Whole Foods for $13.4 billion."

8,2017-06-16," Are you a woman? Have you been a woman? Do you know any women? O.K. Great. Watch the fifth episode of Jill Soloway's ""I Love Dick,"" streaming on Amazon. Right now. You can also watch the four preceding episodes, but you don't have to. Go ahead. I'll wait. Last week, if you ran into me at the theater or the library or the beach at Coney Island, you heard me sell you on this episode, ""A Short History of Weird Girls."" Whip smart, radical, keen and poignant, it is the best 20 minutes of television I've seen in years. Directed by Mx. Soloway, who identifies as nonbinary and prefers gender-neutral pronouns, and written by the playwrights Annie Baker and Heidi Schreck, the episode comprises four monologues in which characters explore how sexual identity has shaped, sharpened and dented their lives. Three women, and one gender-nonconforming character played by Roberta Colindrez, each recite a letter to Dick, here a MacArthur-winning artist and cowboy hobbyist played by Kevin Bacon. As their present-day selves stand in the forefront of the frame narrating their sexual histories, younger versions of them kiss and clutch and ache and blunder in the background. Near the end of her section, the character of Chris, played by Kathryn Hahn, says: ""Sometimes when I walk down the street, I look into the faces of every woman that I pass, and I wonder what she sees. I wonder about the history of her desire."" Watch this episode and you will, too. ""I Love Dick"" is an adaptation of the 1997 book by Chris Kraus, a smart and dizzy work of autofiction, in which a married narrator much like Ms. Kraus details her obsession with a media theorist named Dick. In Mx. Soloway's adaptation, created with Sarah Gubbins, the action has moved to Marfa, Tex., where Chris, an experimental filmmaker, becomes fixated by Dick, who leads an artist's colony and occasionally shears sheep. She writes him a series of hectic, breathless lust letters. The fifth episode doesn't advance the romantic plot; it does something a lot braver, in a manner as formally ambitious as anything on ""Mr. Robot"" or ""Master of None"" or ""The Leftovers."" It insists — here comes the revolutionary part — that sexual identity is crucial to a broader sense of identity, of a piece with emotional and intellectual development. Other episodes in the series play Chris's helpless lust for laughs, but this one takes women's desires seriously in all their convolution and excitement and shame. ""I don't care how you see me,"" Chris tells an imagined Dick. ""I don't care if you want me. It's better that you don't. It's enough that I want you."" Maybe that doesn't sound so world-shattering to you. It does to me. I've spent my adult life as a theater critic, which means accepting that in a lot of what I see, female characters will be relegated to tidy niches (girlfriend or mother, temptress or innocent), the better to tell men's stories. If women's sexual desire is discussed at all, it's usually presented as pathetic (Helena in ""A Midsummer Night's Dream,"" say) or screwy (like Blanche in ""A Streetcar Named Desire""), while what men see and want and do typically drives the action. Often that's O.K. I like men. I like their stories. I'm a big Sam Shepard fan. But seeing women too expansive and untidy for pigeonholing narrate their own lives, well, that's a thrill. So is their demand to be seen as flawed heroes instead of helpmates, sexual subjects as well as sexual objects. Though the format of the ""Dear Dick"" letters might suggest that each woman is defining herself in relation to him, in this episode the objectified Dick is on the sidelines, on a sofa, wearing nothing but a Navajo blanket. (No complaints.) If the stories in ""A Short History of Weird Girls"" feel real, it's because they are. In the ""I Love Dick"" writers' room, staffed exclusively with women and those who don't identify as male or female, writers were asked to share their own sexual experiences. After a week binge-watching films by artists such as Hito Steyerl, Agnès Varda and Chantal Akerman, Ms. Baker and Ms. Schreck assembled those stories into the four monologues. Ms. Baker declined to discuss the episode. (Her most recent play, ""The Antipodes,"" depicts a writers' room, but it's more macho and apocalyptic than intimate.) But Ms. Schreck, who spoke over a latte in a cafe near her Park Slope home and who credits Ms. Baker with the episode's genesis, sees ""A Short History of Weird Girls"" as a deliberate corrective to the television and movies she saw as a teenager and a young woman. A fan of horror films, she ""associated trying sex with getting killed, from the time I was probably 13 or 14,"" she said. ""Growing up, almost all the sex scenes I saw were made by men, written by men,"" she said. ""I couldn't find myself in there. I was always craving sex scenes that felt like what sex was to me."" Ms. Schreck, who used at least one of her own stories in the Chris section, said that the ""I Love Dick"" episode ""was a great experiment in allowing sexuality to feel as unpredictable and varied as it does in your own psyche."" (I should note that Ms. Schreck, who is also an actress, appeared in one of the oddest and funniest sexual situations that's ever lodged in my psyche, in Erin Courtney's 2004 stage comedy, ""Demon Baby."" I should also note that she recently sold a series based on Mary Gaitskill's ""Bad Behavior,"" another work that takes female sexuality seriously, to the Sundance Channel.) Mx. Soloway, speaking by phone from Los Angeles, described feeling ""a little bit scared"" upon seeing the script and its heavy use of voice-over. Then Mx. Soloway began ""to imagine this episode as these women giving their testimonies in the court of the world"" and decided to submit it as the show's directing entry for this year's Emmy Awards, in part to encourage the thousands of members of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences to watch it, too. ""You reel a little bit after watching it,"" Mx. Soloway said. ""You just kind of go: 'What was that? Was that an episode of television? What did I just see?'"" If we're being writers'-room honest, I don't love everything about the episode. There's some confusion as to when and why the present-day women stand apart from their histories and when they embed themselves in flashbacks. It's also unclear whether the glowing blur that occasionally overtakes them (a homage to Naomi Uman's experimental film ""Removed"") represents sexual desire or a more comprehensive sense of identity. But when I watched it, it made me reel. When I streamed it again, more reeling. Dear Dick, Thanks."
9,2017-06-16," Hey, did you hear the one about organic drones? When Amazon announced on Friday that it would buy the grocery retailer Whole Foods for more than $13 billion, the news that one business behemoth would be swallowing another was too juicy for the armchair comics of Twitter and Facebook to let pass without comment. It is the custom of internet life in the 21st century to compete for likes, shares and retweets with wry or snarky comments on the news. Amazon's latest acquisition was no exception. Whole Foods has long been a punch line for people uncomfortable with everything the organic retailer represents. A bourgeois supermarket that caters to people for whom good old Tropicana orange juice just isn't good enough, not when there's juice that's been squeezed by hand from organic oranges plucked from a sun-dappled field by magical unicorns who are raised in only the most humane ways. What's an extra few dollars when you're rushing off to yoga? (Sometimes the company has made the joke too easy. Two years ago, for instance, a Whole Foods in California put three stalks of asparagus in a plastic tub full of water, and tried to charge $5.99 for ""asparagus water."" The product was pulled from the shelf pretty quickly, after a day of ridicule.) And Amazon, along with its founder, chairman and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, has been developing a reputation as a benevolent ruler of modern mass consumption. The online retailer has succeeded by being an extremely convenient way to buy nearly anything and have it delivered with startling speed, even though there might be a little discomfort about the carbon footprint and the closing of beloved bookshops. But at least, customers could rationalize that. Mr. Bezos was using his fortune to pay for great journalism at The Washington Post, along with some charitable work. And fans of innovation do seem to enjoy his company's experiments with talking cylinders for the home and drone deliveries. But underneath all that there are hints of a darker narrative, one where employees face grim pressures. It's a bit like Loki and Deadpool going into the avocado business. It's just the sort of dystopian comedy the internet loves on a Friday. The comments generally fell into four groups. ""For that price, what'd they get? Two bags of granola?,"" wrote Kevin Ridder on Facebook under The New York Times's report of the sale. ""I too have spent $13.7 billion at Whole Foods Market but somehow I only have a half used container of Almond Milk to show for it,"" wrote Penton Tabitha on Facebook. ""Jeffrey, Based on your recent purchase, you may also be interested in: - Wegmans - Trader Joe's - Kroger"" Wrote Romeo Papa on The New York Times."
10,2017-06-16," We're following major market developments throughout the day. Stock in the upscale supermarket chain Whole Foods surged Friday morning after the announcement of its $13.4 billion sale to Amazon. Shares in other grocery giants and retailers plummeted. Stock in Whole Foods rose 27.6 percent. Kroger dropped 13.2 percent and United Natural Foods fell 15.6 percent. Despite announcing a $310 million deal this morning with the men's clothing company Bonobos, Walmart fell 5.4 percent. Target was also down 8.8 percent. • European Union finance ministers meet in Luxembourg a day after E.U. officials agreed to unlock 8.5 billion euros, or $9.5 billion, for Greece to ensure it meets a huge debt payment next month. • The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Robert Kaplan, will deliver a speech in Dallas at 12:45 p.m. Eastern time. • The Bank of Japan held its benchmark interest rate steady, but signaled that it was confident an economic recovery was gaining momentum. • Don't forget to read the DealBook Morning Agenda. Société Générale said on Friday that the initial public offering of ALD, its auto leasing and fleet management arm, raised 1.16 billion euros, or about $1.3 billion. The offering of 80.8 million shares, or about 20 percent of the company, was priced at €14.30 a share, Société Générale said. Shares of ALD rose 1.6 percent in early trading in Paris on Friday. ""We are delighted with the success of the I.P.O. of ALD, which is a key milestone for the strategic development of our subsidiary,"" Frédéric Oudéa, the French bank's chief executive, said in a news release. Société Générale has said that the listing would allow ALD to gain greater visibility, as well as better capacity to pursue growth opportunities in the corporate and business-to-consumer markets. — CHAD BRAY"
11,2017-06-16," Shares of Walmart, Target, Kroger and Costco, the largest grocery retailers, all tumbled on Friday. And no wonder. Grocery stores have spent the last several years fighting against online and overseas entrants. But now, with its $13.4 billion purchase of Whole Foods, Amazon has effectively started a supermarket war. Armed with giant warehouses, shopper data, the latest technology and nearly endless funds — and now with Whole Foods' hundreds of physical stores — Amazon is poised to reshape an $800 billion grocery market that is already undergoing many changes. And much of the battle is expected to take place online, Amazon's home turf. ""This shows that online is going to be very dominant in the grocery business — and very quickly,"" said Errol Schweizer, a former Whole Foods executive. The grocery business is facing a slew of upstart companies trying to figure out how to make a business of getting food on the kitchen table. Instacart delivers food from grocery stores to doorsteps, while FreshDirect delivers from its own warehouse. Blue Apron delivers boxes of food packaged to make meals. In addition, Lidl and Aldi, two European discount grocers, have recently announced enormous expansions in the United States. Aldi plans to invest $3.4 billion to grow from 1,600 stores to 2,500 stores by 2022, while Lidl, which recently opened a handful of locations, plans to operate 100 by the middle of next year. They are taking on a handful of major companies that have dominated the grocery market. Walmart supercenters, Kroger, Safeway and Publix accounted for about 36 percent of the market in 2013, according to the most recent data from the United States Department of Agriculture. While the grocery giants have been under attack, they have advantages of their own. Walmart has 4,500 stores, for example, compared with the 460 Whole Foods, putting it in far more markets. Walmart has also tried to move swiftly into e-commerce, setting up grocery pickup at many stores. A spokesman for Walmart, Randy Hargrove, said the company felt ""great"" about its ""fast-growing"" e-commerce and online grocery businesses. But even before the deal, many of the stores have been showing signs of stress. On Thursday, shares in Kroger fell nearly 19 percent after the company lowered its guidance. On Friday, the company put on a strong face. ""As we've done in the past, we will evolve our business to deliver what our customers want and need today and into the future,"" Kristal Howard, a spokeswoman for Kroger, said in an email. Whole Foods has had its own struggles. Once a pioneer of the organic foods movement, Whole Foods has more recently struggled to shed its image as too pricey, too upscale and too out-of-touch with customers who want more natural foods at more affordable prices. It recently overhauled its board, and Gabrielle Sulzberger, a private equity executive who is married to Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., the chairman and publisher of The New York Times, was named the company's chairwoman. In recent years, competitors moved into its niche. Kroger and Albertsons have bulked up their organic offerings, and organic food has been one of the strongest areas of growth in the grocery business: Last month, the Organic Trade Association announced that sales of organics had increased by 8.4 percent to $43.3 billion, or more than 5 percent of grocery sales. But with Amazon, the equation changes entirely. It is unclear how Amazon will use Whole Foods, as the company would not go into detail about its plans. Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, is known for making unconventional decisions. But he is also known for having big ambitions, and that could mean a more frontal assault on Walmart — a face-off between the old and the new dominant forces in the retail world. Any heated competition among retailers could be a win for consumers who will be able to pick up their organic sugar beets from Canada, fresh turbot from the North Atlantic and papayas from Guatemala at ever-cheaper prices. And Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods may allow the e-commerce giant to court a much different customer. Walmart's vast rural footprint often allows it to be the cheapest option in town, while Whole Foods' stores are in more affluent areas. Amazon recently began to creep into an important part of Walmart's turf — low-income customers — when it slashed the price of its Amazon Prime membership for people with electronic benefits transfer cards, which people on food stamps and other government assistance programs use. Those customers pay $5.99 a month rather than the $10.99 a month or $99 a year other customers pay for Prime, which provides free two-day shipping, streaming video and other benefits. The deal could also help solidify Amazon's existing grocery business. The company's strategy could be ""as much defensive as it is offensive,"" said Burt P. Flickinger III, managing director of Strategic Resource Group, a global consulting firm. Mr. Flickinger recently returned from a research trip to Britain, where he said Lidl had significantly ""slowed down"" Amazon's growth. ""Shoppers, vendors, people with whom we talked across the country said that Lidl literally transformed everybody's standard of living, whether they shopped at Lidl or not,"" he said. ""They either stopped shopping at Amazon, or they shopped a lot less."" As the supermarket war heats up, some grocery store chains, analysts said, may recognize they cannot compete in a grocery store price war. ""The bottom-tier operators are either going to have to close stores or they're going to get sold to the next bigger guy in order to stay alive,"" said Mickey Chadha, an analyst at Moody's Corporation. Morton Williams, a chain of upscale grocery stores in New York, has already adjusted to newer digital delivery services like Fresh Direct and Instacart. But now, executives fear how Amazon could use its digital expertise to expand Whole Foods in Manhattan. ""Fresh Direct and Instacart are already factored into our numbers,"" said Avi Kaner, the co-owner of Morton Williams. ""The thing that could result in greater risk to us is if Amazon invested in the Whole Foods locations in Manhattan to make them more delivery-centric."" Tim Hayduk, 46, likes to shop at the Morton Williams near his office and also enjoys the sense of community that independent grocery stores engender. Now, he worries that more will disappear, as grocery stores big and small compete in an increasingly cluttered market. ""It's sad to see the mom and pops disappear,"" Mr. Hayduk said ""The neighborhood grocery store is really important. You need a quick and easy place."""
12,2017-06-16," (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good evening. Here's the latest. 1. President Trump lashed out at the deputy attorney general over the investigation into Russian election meddling. Acknowledging for the first time publicly that he is under investigation, Mr. Trump appeared to accuse Rod Rosenstein, above, of leading what the president called a ""witch hunt."" We obtained a memo showing that members of Mr. Trump's transition team were ordered to preserve materials related to the investigation. The administration also released new memos stating that it would allow ""Dreamers,"" or undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, to stay — for now. _____ 2. In a speech in Miami, President Trump announced that he was revoking parts of the ""terrible and misguided"" Obama-era policy of rapprochement with Cuba. Arguing that the détente had enriched the Cuban military, Mr. Trump said he would reinstate travel and commercial restrictions to force concessions from the Castro government. But the reversal could hurt small businesses on the island too. There were mixed reactions in Miami's Little Havana. _____ 3. ""Will they send a drone to remove my wallet?"" The news that Amazon is buying Whole Foods for $13.4 billion inspired legions of armchair comics on social media. And we asked Amazon's founder about his philanthropic plans. Jeff Bezos, who is on his way to becoming the richest person in the world, then took to Twitter to solicit ideas. _____ 4. Russia says it might have killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, above, in an airstrike in the Syrian desert. The strike occurred on May 28 outside Raqqa, and the Russian military says it also killed 30 field commanders and as many as 300 fighters. But rumors of Mr. Baghdadi's death have circulated before, and the Pentagon said it had no indication that this one was true. _____ 5. Anger surged over the government's response to the Grenfell Tower fire in London. Hundreds are homeless and the death toll stands at 30, a figure that could rise to 70. The police said they were opening a criminal investigation to determine if negligence had led to the blaze. Among the first victims to be identified: Mohammed Alhajali, a 23-year-old Syrian refugee, above, who had reached Europe by sea. _____ 6. ""My son loved this city, and this city killed my son. And a murderer gets away."" That was Valerie Castile, above, the mother of Philando Castile, whose name became known around the world when he was fatally shot by a police officer — and his girlfriend streamed the aftermath on Facebook Live. The Minnesota police officer, Jeronimo Yanez, was acquitted of second-degree manslaughter and endangering safety by discharging a firearm. _____ 7. A young woman in Massachusetts was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter for urging her boyfriend to kill himself. Michelle Carter, who was 17 at the time of Conrad Roy III's suicide, faces up to 20 years in prison. It was a rare legal finding that, essentially, a person's words alone can directly cause someone else's suicide. _____ 8. Helmut Kohl, the leader who reunified Germany, died at 87. Mr. Kohl was chancellor from 1982 to 1998. He was remembered as a giant of epochal times that redrew Europe's political architecture and dismantled the minefields and watchtowers of the Iron Curtain. _____ 9. ""We wanted to be somewhere different, see something different."" That was the prevailing sentiment at Flint Northwestern High School in Michigan when the time came to plan the prom. The students wanted to escape their anxiety about the city's water crisis, poverty and gun violence. They donned elaborate, color-coordinated outfits for their milestone bash, aboard a riverboat in Detroit. Some had never been to the city before, though it's only an hour away. _____ 10. If you've seen the buddy movie ""The Hangover,"" you have basically seen ""Rough Night,"" starring Scarlett Johansson, our critic says. (She doesn't think that's a good thing.) The movie, about a bachelorette party weekend gone wrong, flips the gender roles, but leaves the cliché-ridden script intact. Instead, you might consider the latest Pixar movie, ""Cars 3,"" which is ""both breezy fun and a pain-free life lesson delivery vehicle"" for adults as well as children. _____ 11. Finally, the late-night hosts riffed on President Trump's assertion that the Russia investigation is a ""WITCH HUNT."" ""Yes, it's just like the Salem witch trials,"" Stephen Colbert joked. ""When those young women were accused of witchcraft and then said, 'We did witchcraft,' in an interview with Lester Holt.""

""Conventional retailers can get it into their stores more cheaply, and they can be more predatory on pricing,"" Mark Retzloff, a pioneer of the natural and organic foods retail business, told The Times. ""If one of those stores is just down the street from a Whole Foods, there's a big segment of their customer base that isn't going to shop at Whole Foods anymore."" 2017: Under Hedge Fund Duress After the activist hedge fund Jana Partners took a stake in Whole Foods and pushed for change, the company overhauled its board in May and began a push to cut costs. Gabrielle Sulzberger, a private equity executive who is married to Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., the chairman and publisher of The New York Times, became chairwoman. In an interview with Texas Monthly published on June 14, Mr. Mackey criticized activist investors. ""It's the idea that business is about a bunch of greedy bastards running around exploiting people, screwing their customers, taking advantage of their employees, dumping their toxic waste in the environment, acting like sociopaths,"" he said. Two days later, Amazon agreed to buy Whole Foods for $13.4 billion."
14,2017-06-16," With Amazon buying the high-end grocery chain Whole Foods, something retail analysts have known for years is now apparent to everyone: The online retailer is on a collision course with Walmart to try to be the predominant seller of pretty much everything you buy. Each one is trying to become more like the other — Walmart by investing heavily in its technology, Amazon by opening physical bookstores and now buying physical supermarkets. But this is more than a battle between two business titans. Their rivalry sheds light on the shifting economics of nearly every major industry, replete with winner-take-all effects and huge advantages that accrue to the biggest and best-run organizations, to the detriment of upstarts and second-fiddle players. That in turn has been a boon for consumers but also has more worrying implications for jobs, wages and inequality. To understand this epic shift, you can look not just to the grocery business, but also to my closet, and to another retail acquisition announced Friday morning. Men's dress clothing, mine included, can be a little boring. Like many male office workers, I lean toward clothes that are sharp but not at all showy. Nearly every weekday, I wear a dress shirt that is either light blue, white or has some subtle check pattern, usually paired with slacks and a blazer. The description alone could make a person doze. I used to buy my dress shirts from a Hong Kong tailor. They fit perfectly, but ordering required an awkward meeting with a visiting salesman in a hotel suite. They took six weeks to arrive, and they cost around $120 each, which adds up fast when you need to buy eight or 10 a year to keep up with wear and tear. Then several years ago I realized that a company called Bonobos was making shirts that fit me nearly as well, that were often sold three for $220, or $73 each, and that would arrive in two days. Bonobos became my main shirt provider, at least until recently, when I learned that Amazon was trying to get into the upper-end men's shirt game. The firm's ""Buttoned Down"" line, offered to Amazon Prime customers, uses high-quality fabric and is a good value at $40 for basic shirts. I bought a few; they don't fit me quite as well as the Bonobos, but I do prefer the stitching. I'm on the fence as to which company will provide my next shirt order, and a new deal this week makes it a doubly interesting quandary: Walmart is buying Bonobos. Walmart's move might seem a strange decision. It is not a retailer people typically turn to for $88 summer weight shirts in Ruby Wynwood Plaid or $750 Italian wool suits. Then again, Amazon is best known as a reseller of goods made by others. Walmart and Amazon have had their sights on each other for years, each aiming to be the dominant seller of goods — however consumers of the future want to buy them. It increasingly looks like that ""however"" is a hybrid of physical stores and online-ordering channels, and each company is coming at the goal from a different starting point. Amazon is the dominant player in online sales, and is particularly strong among affluent consumers in major cities. It is now experimenting with physical bookstores and groceries as it looks to broaden its reach. Walmart has thousands of stores that sell hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of goods. It is particularly strong in suburban and rural areas and among low- and middle-income consumers, but it's playing catch-up with online sales and affluent urbanites. Why are these two mega-retailers both trying to sell me shirts? The short answer is because they both want to sell everything. More specifically, Bonobos is known as an innovator in exactly this type of hybrid of online and physical store sales. Its website and online customer service are excellent, and it operates stores in major cities where you can try on garments and order items to be shipped directly. Because all the actual inventory is centralized, the stores themselves can occupy minimal square footage. So the acquisition may help Walmart build expertise in the very areas where it is trying to gain on Amazon. You can look at the Amazon acquisition of Whole Foods through the same lens. The grocery business has a whole different set of challenges from the types of goods that Amazon has specialized in; you can't store a steak or a banana the way you do books or toys. And people want to be able to make purchases and take them home on the spur of the moment. Just as Walmart is using Bonobos to get access to higher-end consumers and a more technologically savvy way of selling clothes, Amazon is using Whole Foods to get the expertise and physical presence it takes to sell fresh foods. But bigger dimensions of the modern economy also come into play. The apparel business has long been a highly competitive industry in which countless players could find a niche. Any insight that one shirt-maker developed could be rapidly copied by others, and consumer prices reflected the retailer's real estate costs and branding approach as much as anything. That helps explain why there are thousands of options worldwide for someone who wants a decent-quality men's shirt. In that world, any shirt-maker that tried to get too big rapidly faced diminishing returns. It would have to pay more and more to lease the real estate for far-flung stores, and would have to outbid competitors to hire all the experienced shirt-makers. The expansion wouldn't offer any meaningful cost savings and would entail a lot more headaches trying to manage it all. But more and more businesses in the modern economy, rather than reflecting those diminishing returns to scale, show positive returns to scale: The biggest companies have a huge advantage over smaller players. That tends to tilt markets toward a handful of players or even a monopoly, rather than an even playing field with countless competitors. The most extreme example of this would be the software business, where a company can invest bottomless sums in a piece of software, but then sell it to each additional customer for practically nothing. The apparel industry isn't that extreme — the price of making a shirt is still linked to the cost of fabric and the workers to do the stitching — but it is moving in that direction. And that helps explain why Walmart and Amazon are so eager to put a shirt on my back. Already, retailers need to figure out how to manage sophisticated supply chains connecting Southeast Asia with stores in big American cities so that they rarely run out of product. They need mobile apps and websites that offer a seamless user experience so that nothing stands between a would-be purchaser and an order. Larger companies that are good at supply chain management and technology can spread those more-or-less fixed costs around more total sales, enabling them to keep prices lower than a niche player and entrench their advantage. These positive returns to scale could become even more pronounced. Perhaps in the future, rather than manufacture a bunch of shirts in Indonesia and Malaysia and ship them to the United States to be sold one at a time to urban office workers, a company will have a robot manufacture shirts to my specifications somewhere nearby. If that's the future of clothing, and quite a few companies are working on just that, apparel will become a landscape of high fixed costs and enormous returns to scale. The handful of companies with the very best shirt-making robots will win the market, and any company that can't afford to develop shirt-making robots, or isn't very good at it, might find itself left in the cold. If retail were the only industry becoming more concentrated, it would be one thing. But a relative few winners are taking a disproportionate share of business in a wide range of industries, including banking, airlines and telecommunications. A study by the Obama White House's Council of Economic Advisers found that in 12 of 13 industry sectors, the share of revenue earned by the 50 largest firms rose between 1997 and 2012. That in turn may help explain why the income gap has widened in recent years. Essentially, the corporate world is bifurcating between winners and losers, with big implications for their workers. Research by Jae Song of the Social Security administration and four colleagues found that most of the rise of inequality in pay from 1978 to 2013 was because some companies were paying more than others — not because of a wider gap between high-paid and low-paid workers within a company. ""Employees inside winning companies enjoy rising incomes and interesting cognitive challenges,"" the Stanford economist Nicholas Bloom, one of the co-authors of that paper, wrote recently in Harvard Business Review. ""Workers outside this charmed circle experience something quite different."" And David Autor of M.I.T. and four colleagues found in a recent paper that the rise of these ""superstar firms"" — the big winners in the kind of face-off that Walmart and Amazon are now engaged in — is a likely explanation for the decrease in the share of the overall economic pie that is going to workers. How much of that is because of shifting technology — as opposed to changing corporate behavior, or loose antitrust policy — is an open debate. What isn't is this: The decision by Amazon and Walmart to compete for my grocery business — as well as for space in my closet — is a tiny battle in a war to dominate a changing global economy. And for companies that can't compete on price and technology, it could cost them the shirt off their backs."
15,2017-06-16," Amazon agreed to buy the upscale grocery chain Whole Foods for $13.4 billion, in a deal that will instantly transform the company that pioneered online shopping into a merchant with physical outposts in hundreds of neighborhoods across the country. The acquisition, announced Friday, is a reflection of both the sheer magnitude of the grocery business — about $800 billion in annual spending in the United States — and a desire to turn Amazon into a more frequent shopping habit by becoming a bigger player in food and beverages. After almost a decade selling groceries online, Amazon has failed to make a major dent on its own as consumers have shown a stubborn urge to buy items like fruits, vegetables and meat in person. Buying Whole Foods also represents a major escalation in the company's long-running battle with Walmart, the largest grocery retailer in the United States, which has been struggling to play catch-up in internet shopping. On Friday, Walmart announced a $310 million deal to acquire the internet apparel retailer Bonobos, and last year it agreed to pay $3.3 billion for Jet.com and put Jet's chief executive, Marc Lore, in charge of Walmart's overall e-commerce business.  ""Make no mistake, Walmart under no circumstances can lose the grocery wars to Amazon,"" said Brittain Ladd, a strategy and supply chain consultant who formerly worked with Amazon on its grocery business. ""If Walmart loses the grocery battle to Amazon, they have no chance of ever dethroning Amazon as the largest e-commerce player in the world."" The idea of Amazon, a company founded 23 years ago on the premise of shopping from the comfort of a computer screen, moving forcefully into the crowded field of brick-and-mortar retail, with its limitations on selection and lack of customer reviews, once seemed ludicrous. But in the past several years, the company has dabbled with stores, opening or planning more than a dozen bookstores around the country. In Seattle, it recently opened two grocery drive-through stores where customers can pick up online orders, along with a convenience store called Amazon Go that uses sensors and software to let shoppers sail through the exits without visiting a cashier. The addition of Whole Foods takes Amazon's physical presence to a new level. The grocery chain includes more than 460 stores in the United States, Canada and Britain with sales of $16 billion in the last fiscal year. Mikey Vu, a partner at the consultancy Bain & Company who is focused on retail, said, ""They're going to be within an hour or 30 minutes of as many people as possible."" Founded in 1978 in Austin, Tex., Whole Foods is best known for its organic foods, building its brand on healthy eating and fresh, local produce and meats. It has also long been caricatured as ""Whole Paycheck"" for the high prices it charges for groceries. That conflicts with a core tenet of Amazon, which has made low prices part of its mission as a retailer. Analysts speculated that Amazon could use its $99-a-year Prime membership service, which gives customers free, two-day shipping and other benefits, to offer Whole Foods customers a better price on groceries, as it does for books in its bookstores. The stores could also serve as an advertisement to get more customers to sign up for Prime; in September the financial firm Cowen & Company estimated that Prime had 49 million subscribers in the United States, representing about 44 percent of households. Amazon has been on a multiyear offensive to open warehouses closer to customers so it can deliver orders in as little as two hours, and Whole Foods stores will further narrow Amazon's physical proximity to its shoppers. The stores could become locations for returning online orders of all kinds. Amazon could also use them to cut delivery times for online orders. The $13.4 billion deal, which does not include net debt, immediately raised questions about whether Amazon's experiments with automation, like the cashier-less checkout technology it is testing in its Amazon Go store, could eventually lead to job losses at Whole Foods stores. ""Amazon's brutal vision for retail is one where automation replaces good jobs,"" Marc Perrone, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, said in a statement. ""That is the reality today at Amazon, and it will no doubt become the reality at Whole Foods."" Drew Herdener, a spokesman for Amazon, said it has no plans to use the Amazon Go technology to automate the jobs of cashiers at Whole Foods and no job reductions are planned as a result of the deal. Whole Foods workers are not unionized. The move to buy Whole Foods is a further sign of the outsize ambitions of Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive and founder, who came under fire from Donald J. Trump during the presidential campaign last year, when Mr. Trump said Mr. Bezos had a ""huge antitrust problem because he's controlling so much."" Nicole Navas Oxman, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, declined to comment about whether its antitrust division saw any issues with the proposed acquisition. Law professors who specialize in antitrust said it was unlikely regulators would block the deal. ""One question would be, does an online seller of groceries compete with a brick-and-mortar grocery store, and I think the answer is 'yes, at some level, but that overlap is probably not terribly great,'"" said John E. Lopatka, a professor of antitrust law at Penn State University. If the deal goes through, Amazon and Whole Foods will still only account for about 3.5 percent of grocery spending in the United States, making it the country's fifth-largest grocery retailer, according to estimates by John Blackledge, an analyst at Cowen & Company. Groceries are purchased five times a month on average by shoppers, compared with the four times a month Amazon Prime customers typically shop on the site and two times for people who do not have Prime memberships, Cowen estimates. ""If you open up groceries, it could increase the frequency,"" Mr. Blackledge said. For Whole Foods, the deal represents a chance to fend off pressure from activist investors frustrated by a sluggish stock price as it has faced fierce competition from Costco, Safeway and Walmart, which have begun offering organic produce and kitchen staples, forcing Whole Foods to slash prices. Money managers, unhappy with the pace of the turnaround effort, have pushed for more, taking aim at the board, its grocery offerings and its pricey real estate holdings. In response, Whole Foods has revamped its board and replaced its chief financial officer. Gabrielle Sulzberger, a private equity executive, was named the company's chairwoman. Ms. Sulzberger is married to Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., the chairman and publisher of The New York Times. Investors are betting there may be other buyers interested in Whole Foods, and by late Friday the company's shares rose above Amazon's $42 a share offer, nearly 30 percent higher for the day. Amazon closed at $987.71 a share, up 2.4 percent. Even with the bigger physical presence Amazon will gain through Whole Foods, it will have far less reach than Walmart and its Sam's Club warehouse chain, which together account for about 18 percent of the grocery market. Walmart has almost 10 times the number of stores as Whole Foods does. ""We feel great about our position, with more than 4,500 stores around the country and fast growing e-commerce and online grocery businesses,"" Greg Hitt, a spokesman for Walmart, said in a statement."
16,2017-06-16," Walmart has agreed to acquire the men's clothing company Bonobos for $310 million. The purchase is part of a sweeping effort by the world's largest retailer to revamp its business model as it tries to better compete with Amazon, which on Friday announced that it would buy the upscale grocer Whole Foods for $13.4 billion. Bonobos, founded 10 years ago in New York, began by selling simple chino pants on the internet. In recent years, it has expanded to offer shirts, suits and other men's clothing, and has opened dozens of brick-and-mortar locations, as well as boutiques in Nordstrom department stores, a previous investor in the start-up. Yet even as Bonobos has become a more conventional retailer, it has maintained its online ethos, offering generous shipping and return policies and calling its customer-service agents ninjas. Even its stores have a twist — customers are fitted on site, but the clothes are later mailed. This sensibility, and Bonobos's sustained growth, are what attracted the interest of Walmart. Walmart is working aggressively to transform itself into a dominant force in e-commerce. When the company bought Jet.com last year for $3.3 billion, it installed the Jet founder, Marc Lore, to lead its e-commerce efforts in the United States and gave him a mandate to expand quickly. Less than a year later, Mr. Lore and his team have already begun transforming the way Walmart sells things online — and now have bought their most prominent retail brand to date. The deal has been widely rumored since April. When Recode first reported news of the sales talks, some observers speculated that Walmart's ownership would damage the Bonobos brand. But for now, there are no plans to offer Bonobos's $98 chinos or $128 dress shirts in Walmart's 5,000-plus stores. Instead, Walmart is hoping to learn from Bonobos. Its co-founder and chief executive, Andy Dunn, will oversee Walmart's digital brands, which also include the independent women's brand ModCloth. ""I saw Walmart acquire Jet and then ModCloth, and, I thought, they get the future of e-commerce is brands,"" Mr. Dunn said in a telephone interview. The deal is taking place as the retail industry faces broad upheaval, as scores of traditional bricks-and-mortar sellers struggle to keep customers who are increasingly used to buying online. Onetime retail stalwarts like Macy's and Sears have seen sales drop as they struggle to figure out e-commerce strategies, while a host of smaller retailers have filed for bankruptcy protection. Walmart, which has long grappled with how to keep up with Amazon, redoubled its efforts last year by acquiring Jet, a promising but unprofitable marketplace. It is paying Mr. Lore a princely sum to spearhead the revamping of its e-commerce strategy. The Jet deal led to a flurry of changes for Walmart's online sales model. It began offering free two-day shipping without requiring a membership fee, as Amazon does. It drastically expanded the number of items being sold online. It brought on talent like Jenny Fleiss, a founder of Rent the Runway. And it created Store No. 8, a division meant to help hatch new online businesses. It has also gotten serious about acquiring more brands born on the internet. Walmart and Mr. Lore had already spent $166 million buying start-ups like ModCloth and Shoebuy.com. But buying Bonobos is the biggest step yet. ""It's another rung in our strategy of moving fast,"" Mr. Lore said in a phone interview. There are early signs that Walmart's effort is paying off. Walmart's e-commerce sales in the first quarter grew 63 percent from the same time a year ago, with most of the gains coming from Walmart.com. To Mr. Lore, buying a brand like Bonobos is not just about adding third-party apparel. It is also about acquiring the audiences that these start-ups have already attracted, and using Walmart's resources to expand. ""We're offering customers something new by buying these proprietary brands,"" he said. Partnering with Walmart — the biggest bricks-and-mortar retailer around — might have seemed extremely off brand for Bonobos. But Mr. Dunn argued that since the Recode report, his company has not suffered a blow to its growth rate. And he contended that working for the Walmart of 2017 was exciting, particularly with Mr. Lore — a longtime mentor — reimagining the company's e-commerce strategy. ""I'm here because of Marc,"" Mr. Dunn said, adding, ""I think Walmart is misunderstood in some ways."""
17,2017-06-16," Amazon.com just bought its way to the top of the food chain. The e-commerce giant is going whole hog for United States grocery stores with the $13.7 billion acquisition of the upscale chain Whole Foods Market. Amazon's comfort with low margins and knowledge of logistics make it so fearsome a rival that investors in the sector ran for cover. A relentless focus on the long-run opportunity of selling practically everything to everyone has been the hallmark of Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and chief executive. For most of its history, Amazon, a nearly half-trillion-dollar company, has been run at break-even with its prodigious cash flow plowed back into price reductions, expansion into new areas and investment to ensure faster delivery. So groceries are a natural target. Americans spend about $800 billion a year on Cheerios, kale and ground beef, according to Cowen research. It is also a business whose profitability is notoriously low. Whole Foods, for example, generated a net margin of 3.2 percent last year. That is astronomical by Amazon's standards. Its own margin was 1.7 percent. The deal nevertheless creates some seismic shifts. For one thing, it is Amazon's biggest acquisition ever by a considerable sum. While Mr. Bezos has been tinkering with rolling out bookstores, Whole Foods vastly increases Amazon's bricks-and-mortar presence with 460 stores. And the deal expands Amazon's work force by about a quarter. In exchange for this strategic deviation, Amazon gets access to a great many wealthy customers and information about their food-buying habits. Mr. Bezos could easily extend the benefits of his company's popular Prime membership into goods and services at grocery stores, thus giving them additional reason to buy even more from Amazon. It also has been trying to shrink shipping costs. Amazon lost $7 billion in subsidizing deliveries last year. Having customers pick up their purchases in Whole Foods stores might help. There is a strong sense from investors that Amazon is upending the entire business. Its own market value increased by $15 billion on the news. More significantly, it caused about $30 billion to disappear from Costco, Walmart Stores, Kroger, SuperValu and other grocery vendors. Fears of Amazon's domination went global, as British supermarket chains were hit, too. And it is possible that delivery start-ups like Instacart may be affected. Grocery stores aren't a winner-take-all proposition, but Amazon may be about to eat a lot of lunches."
0,2017-06-17," Joke all you want about drone-delivered kale and arugula. Amazon's $13.4 billion bet to take on the $800 billion grocery business in the United States by acquiring Whole Foods fits perfectly into the retailer's business model. Unlike almost any other chief executive, Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, has built his company by embracing risk, ignoring obvious moves and imagining what customers want next — even before they know it. Key to that strategy is his approach to failure. While other companies dread making colossal mistakes, Mr. Bezos seems just not to care. Losing millions of dollars for some reason doesn't sting. Only success counts. That breeds a fiercely experimental culture that is disrupting entertainment, technology and, especially, retail. Mr. Bezos is one of the few chief executives who joke about how much money they've lost. ""I've made billions of dollars of failures,"" Mr. Bezos said at a 2014 conference, adding that it would be like ""a root canal with no anesthesia"" if he listed them. There was the Fire phone, for instance, which was touted as being crucial to Amazon's future. It was one of the biggest bombs since New Coke. At one point, Amazon cut its price to 99 cents. That did not help. For any other company, this would have been a humiliating experience with severe repercussions. Wall Street did not blink, even when Amazon wrote off $170 million related to the device. ""If you're going to take bold bets, they're going to be experiments,"" Mr. Bezos explained. ""And if they're experiments, you don't know ahead of time if they're going to work. Experiments are by their very nature prone to failure. But a few big successes compensate for dozens and dozens of things that didn't work."" It is an approach baked into the company since the beginning — and one that is difficult, if not impossible, for competitors to emulate. Consider how Amazon Web Services began as a small internal cloud computing project to help Amazon's core business. Then the company started selling excess cloud capacity to other companies. Before Google and Microsoft realized it, Amazon had created a high-margin multibillion-dollar business that was encroaching on their turf. They are still struggling to catch up. If the cloud computing business just grew, Amazon Prime was a bold bet from the beginning, the equivalent of an all-you-can-eat buffet for shoppers: Pay an annual fee and all shipping costs for the year are covered. Amazon's shipping expenses ballooned, but revenue soared so much that no one minded. ""When you have such a long-term perspective that you think in decades instead of quarters, it allows you to do things and take risks that other companies believe would not be in their best interests,"" said Colin Sebastian, an analyst with the investment firm Robert W. Baird & Company. Amazon began, for those too young to remember, as a discount internet bookseller in 1995. In the headiness of the late-1990s dot-com boom, it became the symbol of how this new invention called the World Wide Web was going to change everything. Then, like many of the leading dot-com companies, it blew up. The world wasn't quite ready for Amazon. It came very close to going under. Mr. Bezos redoubled his focus on customers, largely closed the company off to the media and got to work doing some serious experiments. Amazon developed, for instance, the Kindle e-reader, which for a time seemed likely to kill off physical books entirely. One thing the retailer did not do was make much money. In its two decades as a public company, Amazon has had a cumulative profit of $5.7 billion. For a company with a market value of nearly $500 billion, this is negligible. Walmart, which has a market value half that of Amazon, made a profit of $14 billion in 2016 alone. Huge profits at Amazon were always put aside so the company could invest more. This has tended to drive both skeptics — there are still a few, even now — and competitors crazy. ""Did Amazon Just Jump the Shark?"" was the headline on an article on the investing website Seeking Alpha on Friday. But the tens of millions of customers do not care whether Amazon is hugely profitable. They care if it is making their lives easier or better. ""Jeff Bezos is making shopping great,"" said Chris Kubica, an e-book consultant and software developer who watches Amazon closely. ""He's made me come to expect better from every checkout counter. Oh, I can scan my entire shopping cart full of groceries in one go, without stopping, as I roll into the parking lot? Yes, please. Where do I park?"" After the company's disastrous foray with the Fire Phone, Amazon could have done what many other also-rans in smartphones do and keep putting out devices that most people ignore in favor of Apple and Samsung devices. Instead, in 2014 it released Echo, a speaker that looks like a small poster tube. The Alexa intelligent assistant, which runs on it, can play music and tell jokes, and now Google, Apple and Microsoft are copying it. ""Bezos is ahead of the game, always,"" said Sunder Kekre, a professor at the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University. ""Be it drones or Amazon Go"" — a grab-and-go shopping experiment that eschews human cashiers — ""he is able to craft smart business strategies and position Amazon quite distinctly from competitors."" As Amazon pushes on with its ceaseless experimenting, however, it risks being seen as less of a cute disrupter of the old and as more of a menace. It has hired many workers for its warehouses, but it is also betting heavily on automation. Amazon Go, after all, is an attempt to drain the labor out of shopping. ""Amazon runs the risk of becoming too big,"" Mr. Kekre said. Some Amazon critics would like the Whole Foods deal to be the trigger for reining in the company. The Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a frequent foe of Amazon, noted that the company is ""rapidly monopolizing online retail"" and that both Prime and Echo ""are strategies for locking in consumers and ensuring they don't shop anywhere else."" Amazon declined to comment for this article. Where will it all end? Mr. Kubica has thought about this. Amazon can be understood as a decades-long effort to shorten the time between ""I want it"" and ""I have it"" into as brief a period as possible. The logical end of this would be the something Mr. Kubica jestingly called Amazon Imp, short for ""implant"" and also ""impulse,"" Mr. Kubica said. It would be a chip inserted under the skin. ""The imp would sense your impulses and desires,"" Mr. Kubica wrote in an email, ""and then either virtually fulfill them by stimulating your brain (for a modest payment to Amazon, of course) or it would make a box full of goodies for you appear on your doorstep (for a larger fee, of course)."" Every desire fulfilled. ""I am sure that Amazon even now is building it,"" Mr. Kubica said."
1,2017-06-17," Imagine this scene from the future: You walk into a store and are greeted by name, by a computer with facial recognition that directs you to the items you need. You peruse a small area — no chance of getting lost or wasting time searching for things — because the store stocks only sample items. You wave your phone in front of anything you want to buy, then walk out. In the back, robots retrieve your items from a warehouse and deliver them to your home via driverless car or drone. Amazon's $13.4 billion purchase of Whole Foods, announced Friday, could speed that vision along. Amazon has already made shopping for almost everything involve spending less time waiting, doing work or interacting with people, and now it could do the same for groceries. It's already trying with a store in Seattle, Amazon Go, that has no salespeople or checkout lines. Our mental image of job-killing automation is robots in factories or warehouses. But the next jobs to disappear are probably ones that are a much bigger part of most people's daily lives: retail workers and cashiers in stores and restaurants. For a long time, economists argued that routine jobs like factory and clerical work were vulnerable to automation but that jobs in both the service and knowledge sectors were safer. They require human skills that are hard for machines to imitate, like judgment and adaptability. These skills are useful when an executive makes strategic business decisions or when a chef fries one customer's egg and scrambles another's. But it has become increasingly clear that parts of every job will be automated — and that the service sector is next. Although certain service jobs like health aide or preschool teacher still seem safe, others, like those in retail and food service, are already being displaced. It's not hard to teach a machine to do routine tasks like scanning bar codes, stocking shelves or dunking fries in oil. Eight million people, 6 percent of American workers, are retail salespeople and cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Cashier jobs are expected to grow 2 percent by 2024, significantly slower than 7 percent job growth over all, and technology is the main reason, according to the bureau. Half the time worked by salespeople and cashiers is spent on tasks that can be automated by technology that's currently in use, according to a recent McKinsey Global Institute report. Two-thirds of the time on tasks done by grocery store workers can be automated, it said. Another report, by Forrester, estimated that a quarter of the tasks salespeople do would be automated this year, and 58 percent by 2020. Estimates like these are guesses at best, because imagining the future is an act of science fiction. And even when technologies exist, companies adopt them slowly. That's one reason productivity isn't increasing at the rate economists might expect, even though more work is able to be automated. But there is evidence that retail jobs are transforming rapidly. Look no further than the Amazon Go store. It has no cashiers or checkout lines. People scan their phones to enter, and sensors with computer vision monitor what they put in their carts. When they leave, they are automatically charged for what they have bought. Amazon calls it ""just walk out technology."" Amazon Go is open only to Amazon employees for now, and has reportedly had problems during its testing phase, particularly when the store is crowded. But the technology will improve as Amazon and other retailers keep testing and developing it. Elsewhere, Amazon uses automatic payment technology, drones that deliver purchases, and robots that restock shelves and fill boxes. Lowe's stores in California have customer service robots that roam the aisles to answer customers' questions and monitor inventory. The Eatsa chain of restaurants has no human workers in sight. Customers order on store iPads or on their phones, and pick up their meals from a cubby that shows their name. Several fast-food chains, including McDonald's and Panera, also use digital kiosks for customers to order and pay by themselves. Companies won't invest in technology unless it's less expensive than employing people, and most retail workers make near minimum wage. But in a case study of grocery stores, McKinsey found that the savings from automation were three times the cost, and 68 percent of the savings were from reduced labor costs. Retailers say automating certain tasks doesn't necessarily displace employees, but frees them to do other things that are more valuable to customers. Lowe's, for instance, said its customer service robot answered simple questions so employees could provide more personalized expertise, like home project planning. Whole Foods, before the Amazon acquisition, made a similar argument to Forrester. ""We intentionally don't over-automate our stores, at least not on the front end,"" an executive told Forrester, which didn't name the person in its report. ""We want to have the personal touch of real people."" But shoppers often prefer to save time by interacting with fewer people, especially when they just need coffee or paper towels — thus the convenience of online ordering for in-store pickup at places like Walmart and Starbucks. If salespeople and cashiers lose their jobs in large numbers, as economists say seems likely, they could be in better shape in some ways than those who have lost jobs in industries like manufacturing. Sales jobs are not geographically confined, and high turnover means wider availability. On the other hand, said David Autor, an M.I.T. economist, it would make the job market even more challenging for a group of workers who already struggle to find stable, well-paid employment and are unlikely to have the education to move into better jobs. Amazon said it had no plans to lay off Whole Foods workers or use Amazon Go technology to automate cashiers' jobs. Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the M.I.T. Initiative on the Digital Economy, said Amazon's plans could be much bigger than simply automating stores. ""The bigger and more profound way that technology affects jobs is by completely reinventing the business model,"" he said. ""Amazon didn't go put a robot into the bookstores and help you check out books faster. It completely reinvented bookstores. The idea of a cashier won't be so much automated as just made irrelevant — you'll just tell your Echo what you need, or perhaps it will anticipate what you need, and stuff will get delivered to you."""
2,2017-06-17," When big tech companies make big moves, it's natural to see the news in earthshaking terms. So it was no surprise that Amazon's deal to buy Whole Foods for $13.4 billion generated many fantastical predictions: For instance, Amazon could use every Whole Foods store as a distribution center or even a drone-delivery launchpad, with every order summoned by Alexa, the company's voice assistant, creating a kind of ""frictionless"" retail experience that would hasten its plan to — what else? — take over the world. Sure, all of this seems plausible at some point in the future. In particular, an Amazon presence in groceries might transform it from a company you shop at every once in a while to one you think about several times a week. This is not a novel idea: It was the key reason Walmart got into the grocery business in the 1980s, a move that accelerated its shift from a regional chain into the world's largest physical retailer. Yet if there's one thing I've learned about Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and chief executive, after years of watching Amazon, it's that he doesn't spend a lot of time predicting future possibilities. He is instead consumed with improving the present reality on the ground, especially as seen through a customer's eyes. The other thing to know about Mr. Bezos is that he is a committed experimentalist. His main way of deciding what Amazon should do next is to try stuff out, see what works, and do more of that. So the best way to think of this deal is to look at Whole Foods as a kind of guinea pig for Amazon — a pricey, organically sourced one, perhaps, but a guinea pig all the same. Amazon almost certainly doesn't know yet how exactly Whole Foods will fit into its long-term plans. You can expect it to make few dramatic changes to Whole Foods in the near future. Instead, Mr. Bezos and his team will most likely spend years meticulously analyzing and tinkering with how Whole Foods works. They will begin lots of experiments. When something works, they will do more of that, then more, and then even more. They may take over the world all the same — and, in the process, probably usher in big changes to large swaths of the economy, affecting everything from labor to urban planning — but they'll do it in ways we won't be able to predict now. ""I think they look at this as an opportunity to learn,"" said Venky Harinarayan, an early Amazon executive who later worked at Walmart, and who also ran a venture capital firm in which Mr. Bezos was a big investor. ""It's an experiment for everyone — I don't know if anyone has figured out yet how to use a store to service online customers at massive scale. That's the experimental piece."" In this light, I suspect that the Whole Foods deal starts less with a strategic end-goal and more with this insight: Shopping for food is broken. Both the in-store experience and the many attempts at online delivery — from Webvan to Instacart to Amazon's own service, Amazon Fresh — have failed to create the sort of seamless buying experience we enjoy with nonfood e-commerce. Shopping for food is time-consuming — about 16 percent of Americans spend nearly an hour shopping for food every weekend, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Grocers have also been relatively untouched by the many customer service features we've come to associate with online shopping — for instance, customer reviews and recommendations. Supermarkets are also pretty labor-intensive. Consider checking out: You have to put all your stuff in a cart, and then someone else takes everything out to scan it, and then everything has to be carefully bagged for the trip home. And then someone else comes along to collect the carts. On top of all this, the margins are low and there is a shameful amount of waste — about 10 percent of the American food supply is wasted at the retail level, according to the Department of Agriculture. But online grocery delivery also isn't so great. Delivery services tend to be far more expensive than in-store shopping, and it's still not quite painless: You have to order ahead of time, you often have to deal with last-minute substitutions, and the whole process is still quite labor-intensive and wasteful. (Ask me about the many pounds of ice-filled plastic bags I have to dispose of every time I shop at Amazon Fresh.) And it's not just food. In a larger sense, all physical retail needs reimagining. Competition from online commerce has gutted malls and department stores, but no one in retail believes that all physical stores are going away. Lots of shoppers like stores, and lots of merchandise categories benefit from a physical presence: You want to try out the clothes you buy, or you want to compare the iPad's keyboard to Microsoft Surface's. So there's an opportunity for someone to figure out the future of the physical store — what it should sell, what it might look like, how it would integrate with online shopping and how it might become far friendlier than it is today. In a single purchase, then, Whole Foods gives Amazon a playground to try out lots of ideas. Should stores be laid out more like warehouses, to optimize for online delivery? Could you make grocery checkout lines invisible, the way Amazon is trying to do with its experimental grab-and-walk-out convenience store in Seattle? Or maybe there's some other innovation lurking in the deal that no one has thought of yet. But wait a second, isn't $13.4 billion a lot for an experiment? Amazon didn't respond to a request for comment. ""No doubt it's a big deal; it's a large amount of money,"" Mr. Harinarayan said. But he also noted that Amazon is flying high. Like most other members of my Frightful Five collection of indomitable tech giants — Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and Alphabet, Google's parent company — Amazon has experienced a huge growth in its stock market value over the past couple years. The Whole Foods deal represents less than 3 percent of its $470 billion market cap: not just a guinea pig, but a cheap one, too."
3,2017-06-17," Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week's news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. This week, Farhad and Mike also talked with Cade Metz, who just joined The Times as a technology reporter. Farhad: Hello, Mike! There's a lot going on in the world, but can I just say: How great is it that the Warriors won the N.B.A. championship and proved, once and for all, that the Bay Area is the best? California4Eva! Anyway, how are you? Mike: Ahoy, Farhad! I don't care about sports, so I won't pretend to now for the sake of exchanging pleasantries. You know what I do care about? Artificial intelligence. No, I'm not referring to your intellect, Farhad. I'm making a quick segue into introducing our newest addition to the tech team, Cade Metz. He just joined us. Cade: Yes, I am the first A.I. reporter ever at The Times. I'm a bot trained from reams of data detailing the behavior of some Silicon Valley hack during his five years at Wired magazine, incluing al thos typos. So when I insult you and Farhad on Twitter, don't take it personally. That's just the way I was built. O.K., that's not true. I'm not a bot. I'm just some hack who covers A.I. The truth is: A.I. is a long way from mimicking the behavior of a Times reporter. I hope. Mike: Elon Musk was right. We are all doomed. Farhad: Great, let's chat about tech news. So the big thing this week was Uber, more Uber and still more Uber, with a little bit of Amazon and Whole Foods thrown in. But we'll get to all that in a bit. Let's start with other stuff. Facebook said that it would begin to explain to the public how it tackles ""hard questions"" that arise out of its service — things like how Facebook affects democracies, or whether and how kids should use it. In its first such effort, the company detailed how it's using artificial intelligence to fight the spread of terrorists online. I have to say, I was really impressed with this whole exercise. I think tech companies have long been too reluctant to talk about the potential dangers of their technology. It's great that Facebook — after, of course, a lot of questions and prodding arising out of its role in the election — is taking these issues seriously. But Cade, you're our resident A.I. expert, so could you explain what exactly Facebook is doing, and whether it'll work? Cade: Well, the people who wrote that blog post are policy folks, not engineers. They're using the term A.I. in the broadest of ways (like so many people these days). In most cases, they use A.I. to mean technology, as opposed to human involvement. Some of the stuff they talk about, like identifying an image known to be related to terrorism, will work well. But other stuff, like the experimental system that seeks to identify online conversation and other natural language that points to terrorism, won't work really well for years. (Hint: experimental is a key word). That kind of thing requires A.I. that is still very much under development. The other key bit is where they say: ""A.I. can't catch everything."" That's an understatement. When it comes to catching unwanted behavior on Facebook— whether it's someone planning an act of terrorism or spreading fake news — Zuckerberg and company still need help from real live humans who see this stuff as it happens. That means Facebook users who can flag questionable content with a click, and it means the many contractors hired to review what has been flagged and remove what needs to be removed. This is stuff is very hard, and it will continue to be very hard until A.I. gets a lot better. All that said, I agree with you, Farhad. Hard stuff should be taken seriously. Farhad: This week, Silicon Valley also celebrated the life of Charles Thacker. Cade, you're a kind of Valley historian, aren't you? What can you tell us about Thacker? Cade: If you use a computer or a smartphone or the internet, you should read our obituary of Thacker. He is one of just a handful of people who designed the fundamental technologies that drive everything we do online. In Thacker's case, he was among the researchers at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Lab in the 1970s who built the Alto, the machine with the graphical user interface that spawned the Macs and the PCs and, eventually, the smartphones that are such a big part of our everyday lives. Plus, he helped design Ethernet, the networking technology that linked the Altos together — and now links all the machines in your office, not to mention the thousands of machines inside the giant data centers that feed all the internet apps you use. Think of it like this: When Steve Jobs died, he deserved avalanche of tributes that arrived from across the globe, and Thacker deserves much the same. Farhad: Now let's get to Uber. Months after a former employee, Susan Fowler, detailed incidents of sexual harassment and rampant misogyny at the company, the company announced a huge set of reforms to its culture and workplace practices. Also, Travis Kalanick, the C.E.O. and basically the embodiment of Uber, said he would be taking a leave of absence. These are huge changes. I'm not sure if people who don't follow the tech industry get this — a few months ago, it was unimaginable that Kalanick, who has overwhelming control of the company, could ever be pressured to step away. And if Uber actually follows through on its plan to remake its culture, it will operate like a completely different company. But that's what makes me so skeptical of this plan. Can a $70 billion company really change so radically? Mike: My official assessment: I have no clue. To be honest, a lot of this seems to hinge on the personality of Travis, who is famously aggressive and obsessive. And while he's said he's taking time off right now, I do wonder whether that will hold true — especially since Uber is undergoing its most prolonged set of crises, um, ever. I think companywide DNA, instilled and fostered by the founders, is seriously difficult to change. Just ask Twitter. That said, we should give Uber a chance — just like it is giving peace a chance! — and see what the company looks like six months to a year from now. Cade: However all this shakes out, one thing is clear: Uber will continue to dominate the ride-hailing market for years to come. Its lead is just too big. But the slightly more distant future is driverless cars, and the scandals — among other things — have really hurt the company's effort to make headway in this area. The question for me is whether Uber can still compete in this race to A.I. But, well, I'm an A.I. reporter. Mike: Indeed you are, robot Cade. And now to get as far away from A.I. as possible — what do you think of Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods? Cade: Actually there is an A.I. angle. As we point out in our piece about Amazon's deal to acquire Whole Foods, this is part of a major pivot into brick-and-mortar stores. Among other things, Amazon is experimenting with systems that will let you automatically pay for your groceries as you walk out of a store with them — A.I. is everywhere! And somewhere down the line, Whole Foods can feed those efforts to streamline the way we buy stuff in person. But this can also feed the company's larger mission to sell stuff online. What Amazon is good at is building enormous supply chains and physical infrastructure (warehouses, trucks, planes, even drones) that provide ways of delivering goods to your door much quicker than competitors can. By the same token, Whole Foods puts more Amazon groceries closer to you. Those stores aren't just stores. They're part of the supply chain. Mike: This Whole Foods talk is making me hungry. Thanks for joining us, Cade. Until next week."
4,2017-06-17," Since John Mackey co-founded a precursor to Whole Foods in 1978, he has taken a hands-on management approach to the organic grocery chain. He personally oversaw each step of its national expansion. During a takeover battle 10 years ago, Mr. Mackey used a pseudonym to write anonymous blog posts attacking a competitor. So over the last two years, as Whole Foods' stock price sunk and activist investors called for changes, Mr. Mackey took the challenges to his company personally. After three decades of running a beloved chain of upscale grocers that had helped revolutionize the way Americans ate, Mr. Mackey, a hippie who rails against greed, was mired in a bare-knuckle fight with Wall Street. Last year, Mr. Mackey tried to reassert control, pledging to become more hands-on and address investor concerns. But behind the scenes, the forces that would lead Whole Foods to agree to sell itself to Amazon for $13.4 billion on Friday were already at work. In September, Neuberger Berman, a $267 billion investment firm that had been quietly building its own position in Whole Foods stock, sent a letter to the board of directors that highlighted issues with the company's business. In November, Walter Robb, Mr. Mackey's co-chief executive and heir apparent, stepped down. Mr. Mackey was once again leading the company on his own and personally pledged to increase margins and revamp operations. Those changes were not enough for Neuberger Berman, and its executives began a behind-the-scenes campaign to shake up Whole Foods last year, seeking to enlist the help of activist hedge funds. Among the things they had discussed were strategic options for the company to pursue. Then, in April, Jana Partners, an $8.5 billion activist investor, announced its position as the company's largest outside shareholder. Jana outlined a laundry list of concerns it said the company needed to address, including the way it had conducted its business, and took aim at what it said were deficiencies in customer service and distribution strategy, as well as analytics and brand development. The hedge fund also put forth a list of four nominees to replace members of the Whole Foods board. Mr. Mackey was outraged at the developments, which took place on the eve of a scheduled book tour, and vowed a fight. ""These people, they just want to sell Whole Foods Market and make hundreds of millions of dollars, and they have to know that I'm going to resist that,"" Mr. Mackey told Texas Monthly. ""That's my baby. I'm going to protect my kid, and they've got to knock Daddy out if they want to take it over."" But Jana had hit on issues that other investors, including Neuberger Berman, had raised. In April, Neuberger Berman wrote another letter urging the company to explore the possibility of a sale. In an effort to broker peace with Jana, Whole Foods said it was willing to consider some of the candidates that Jana put forward for the board. After interviewing four of them, Whole Foods said it would consider two, on the condition that Jana back down from its public aggression, Mr. Mackey said. But Jana declined to compromise. As Whole Foods' troubles spilled into public view, talk about a sale of the company began to swirl. Amazon — the leading force in e-commerce — was among the companies that had initial discussions with the Whole Foods board. Whole Foods was unsure of how serious Amazon was — Amazon's founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, had never struck a deal of this size before — and the talks did not move fast at first. Soon after that, Whole Foods announced its own board overhaul and pledged to improve short-term results. Gabrielle Sulzberger, a private equity executive who is married to Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., the chairman and publisher of The New York Times, was named the company's chairwoman. After the Whole Foods board shake-up, talks with Amazon accelerated. Facing unrelenting pressure from Wall Street, the supermarket's board soon decided that pursuing a sale to the online colossus was the best move, with Amazon providing technological know-how and the promise of bolstering operational efficiency. On Friday, Whole Foods announced it would sell itself to Amazon, a transaction — code-named ""Project Tree"" by bankers — that stands to reshape the entire grocery industry, swaths of e-commerce and possibly the retail landscape at large. By late Friday, Whole Foods stock rose above Amazon's offer of $42 a share, as investors bet on a potential bidding war over the upscale market chain. For a transaction that promises seismic changes, the talks between the two companies were fairly swift, according to people with knowledge of the matter. For Whole Foods, whose ethos was once so crunchy granola that it did not originally sell beer or meat, Amazon and its vast empire of warehouses and robots might seem an odd match. But the deep pockets of Mr. Bezos offer Whole Foods a way to escape the harsh glare of public investors who demanded cost cuts, shake-ups in management and on the board and more. Mr. Mackey did not speak to the press on Friday. A spokesman for Jana also declined to comment. Inside Whole Foods, the news of the sale to Amazon was greeted with a sense of relief, according to employees who agreed to talk on the condition of anonymity because they did not have permission to speak to the news media. Charles Kantor, who oversees Neuberger Berman's main investment in Whole Foods, said his team was caught by surprise when the news broke. ""It obviously happened very quickly,"" Mr. Kantor said. ""Remember, the board just changed, and it was all Mackey's lieutenants who would have liked nothing more than to come out on top."" Mr. Kantor also indicated that he expected the Whole Foods board to consider any other bids that were made. ""I don't think this is the final chapter,"" he added ""Amazon gets one of the best brands in the world for a very thrifty multiple."" Although Mr. Mackey was able to sell Whole Foods on his own terms, the activist investors he so loathes came out on top, too. From its brief investment in Whole Foods, Jana Partners, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, stands to make about $301 million."

1,2017-06-19," Even as Amazon's $13.4 billion bid for Whole Foods threatens to shake up food retailing, Blue Apron, a New York-based meal-delivery service, is setting its sights on a stock market debut. The service has begun pitching an initial public offering to raise as much as $586.5 million, joining a growing number of consumer-focused start-ups considering the public markets. Yet its prospective investors are aware that Blue Apron is doing so as Amazon, the colossus of e-commerce, may be changing the nature of food shopping altogether. Analysts have speculated endlessly about what Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, intends to do should he complete the blockbuster deal for Whole Foods. Amazon, they note, has already dabbled in experiments, including drive-through grocery stores and high-tech stores with no cashiers. Combining its e-commerce knowledge with Whole Foods' wares would be a no-brainer, these analysts suggest. Shares of other grocery chains plunged after Amazon's bid for Whole Foods was announced Friday, and analysts speculated about what that union would mean for food-delivery start-ups like Instacart. Shares of Kroger tumbled 9 percent Friday, although they recovered 1.6 percent Monday. Whole Foods shares, meanwhile, continued to rise Monday and closed at $43.22 — more than Amazon's cash offer of $42 a share, suggesting investors are optimistic that a higher bid may yet emerge. Other big retailers have bought or invested in internet start-ups to bolster their e-commerce capabilities. Walmart recently agreed to buy Bonobos, a men's clothing company, for $310 million, and Target led a $170 million investment into Casper, a maker of mattresses and other sleep products. Blue Apron also faces meal-kit competition from HelloFresh, Sun Basket and Purple Carrot. Such companies were founded on the premise that customers want fresh ingredients and the convenience of home delivery with the satisfaction of actually preparing their meals at home. Blue Apron is likely to argue to prospective investors that its niche in the food-delivery service is significantly different from the more general service that Amazon offers through PrimeFresh. Founded in 2012, Blue Apron is well known among the cognoscenti of podcasts and other media popular with millennials. That popularity has been a result of aggressive marketing. Blue Apron's marketing expense is enormous, and it has been growing, jumping tenfold from 2014 to 2016, to $144.1 million. Now the company is hoping to capitalize on its growth by pursuing an initial public offering. It is taking that step with the public markets appearing more welcoming to debutantes: The number of offerings tripled, to 25, in the first quarter of this year from the same time last year. Such offerings raised nearly $10 billion in proceeds in the quarter. Among those offerings was one by Snap, the parent of Snapchat and the most recent prominent consumer-focused company to go public, in March. In an amended prospectus on Monday, Blue Apron said it planned to price its shares between $15 and $17. At the midpoint of that range, the company would be valued at roughly $3 billion; at the high end, it would be valued at $3.2 billion. The company plans to sell at least 30 million shares, although underwriters can sell an additional 4.5 million shares if demand is strong enough. Since its inception, Blue Apron has posted significant gains in sales, with its revenue in 2016 more than doubling from the previous year, to $795.4 million. But it has continued to lose money — $54.9 million last year — as it has spent on marketing and growth. Its offering is being led by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Barclays. The company plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol APRN."
2,2017-06-19," Jeff Bezos went shopping and now the entire retail industry is scrambling to secure shelf space. Even before Amazon's deal to buy the upscale grocery chain Whole Foods for $13.4 billion, changes were in motion for the retail landscape: • Walmart agreed to buy the men's clothing company Bonobos for $310 million, gaining a conventional retailer with brick-and-mortar locations, and an online ethos. • Target is leading a new investment in Casper, a mattress maker that rose to prominence through e-commerce and plans to announce as soon as today that it has raised $170 million. This round of investment values Casper at approximately $750 million, not including the new investment. Target had offered to buy Casper, but the companies failed to agree on terms. The Amazon deal for Whole Foods is yet another example of the influence of activist investors — or ""greedy bastards"" as John Mackey, the Whole Foods chief executive, had referred to them. The rise of activist investors and technological change has led to a decline in the tenure and dominion of chief executives. Amazon's move also illustrates the willingness of Mr. Bezos, its chief executive, to experiment at the risk of failing. While other companies hold back, dreading colossal mistakes, Amazon has made bold bets in a way that few others can emulate. So, are we going to see fantastical changes to the way we shop? Possibly. In the short term, we are likely to see Amazon put experimentation into practice, tinkering with how Whole Foods works. Mr. Bezos is ""consumed with improving the present reality on the ground, especially as seen through a customer's eyes,"" Farhad Manjoo writes in State of the Art. We can also expect Amazon to push more speedily toward grocery stores without cashiers or checkout lines. Over the weekend, Frank Quattrone, the successful technology banker turned exonerated defendant, turned successful technology banker, began an unusually intense debate on Twitter. He questioned reporters' use of anonymous sources to break news, but several journalists, including Andrew Ross Sorkin of DealBook and Kara Swisher, executive editor of Recode, have defended journalism based on leaks. Still, for the past several days, Quattrone has criticized the practice of leaking, whether in the business world or by government officials. • The back story: The prosecutor who led the criminal case against Mr. Quattrone (which was later overturned on appeal) was … James Comey, the former F.B.I. director. Repeatedly criticizing his onetime antagonist, the banker seized upon Mr. Comey's admission during recent congressional testimony that he had caused the leaking of one of his memos to The New York Times. You wouldn't do it if you had a choice. But millions of Americans don't have an alternative. People with poor credit histories have resorted to subprime auto loans, with high interest rates and hefty fees, to buy a car because they need to get to work or to the doctor's office. These loans have continued to dog them even after their cars have been repossessed. The lenders, unable to recover the balance of the loans by reselling the cars, have been suing borrowers to collect what remains, sometimes as long as 13 years later. With defaults rising, banking regulators and economists have started to worry about the spillover from the strain of these loans. The fallout for low-income Americans could be worse than it was during the mortgage crisis: They cannot turn in the keys and walk away, like they could with mortgages. Even so, securities tied to the loans are still a profitable and sought-after investment on Wall Street. • Talks to discuss Britain's departure from the European Union started today. Prime Minister Theresa May is under increasing pressure to soften her ""Brexit"" plans with calls to keep Britain inside the bloc's customs union."

Mr. Bezos is ""consumed with improving the present reality on the ground, especially as seen through a customer's eyes,"" Farhad Manjoo writes in State of the Art. We can also expect Amazon to push more speedily toward grocery stores without cashiers or checkout lines. Over the weekend, Frank Quattrone, the successful technology banker turned exonerated defendant, turned successful technology banker, began an unusually intense debate on Twitter. He questioned reporters' use of anonymous sources to break news, but several journalists, including Andrew Ross Sorkin of DealBook and Kara Swisher, executive editor of Recode, have defended journalism based on leaks. Still, for the past several days, Quattrone has criticized the practice of leaking, whether in the business world or by government officials. • The back story: The prosecutor who led the criminal case against Mr. Quattrone (which was later overturned on appeal) was … James Comey, the former F.B.I. director. Repeatedly criticizing his onetime antagonist, the banker seized upon Mr. Comey's admission during recent congressional testimony that he had caused the leaking of one of his memos to The New York Times. You wouldn't do it if you had a choice. But millions of Americans don't have an alternative. People with poor credit histories have resorted to subprime auto loans, with high interest rates and hefty fees, to buy a car because they need to get to work or to the doctor's office. These loans have continued to dog them even after their cars have been repossessed. The lenders, unable to recover the balance of the loans by reselling the cars, have been suing borrowers to collect what remains, sometimes as long as 13 years later. With defaults rising, banking regulators and economists have started to worry about the spillover from the strain of these loans. The fallout for low-income Americans could be worse than it was during the mortgage crisis: They cannot turn in the keys and walk away, like they could with mortgages. Even so, securities tied to the loans are still a profitable and sought-after investment on Wall Street. • Talks to discuss Britain's departure from the European Union started today. Prime Minister Theresa May is under increasing pressure to soften her ""Brexit"" plans with calls to keep Britain inside the bloc's customs union."
6,2017-06-19," Walmart's market capitalization dropped 5 percent, losing $11 billion, after Amazon unveiled its $13.4 billion deal to buy Whole Foods Market on Friday. Meanwhile, Whole Foods shares closed Friday nearly 2 percent above the agreed price, implying that some investors think a rival bid could emerge. But even for Walmart, that would be a stretch. Whole Foods' filing suggests it wasn't shopped around. Amazon became serious only in late April, when the company's team signed confidentiality agreements. That means some shareholders, notably Jana Partners, an activist owner of an 8 percent stake, could be receptive to a higher price. A grocery industry buyer like Walmart could also cut costs, helping to justify paying more than the 27 percent premium Amazon is offering. Then there's the defensive value. If investors were right to sell off grocery chain stocks across the board in the United States and Europe on news of Amazon's plunge into the sector, it could be worth keeping Jeff Bezos' online giant away from Whole Foods. Walmart is one of few candidates. Its $230 billion market value dwarfs other listed United States grocers, including Target, Kroger and Sprouts Farmers Market, as well as Albertsons, which is private. Its balance sheet cash could in theory finance nearly half the acquisition, and with total debt at about 1.5 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, it could borrow more. Adding an upscale brand might help Walmart attract new customers and lift its grocery business. Yet that would be a change of direction. Its recent strategy has been to improve its e-commerce offering, including with Friday's deal to buy the men's clothing online retailer Bonobos. Financially, too, topping Mr. Bezos' offer would be tough. Assume Walmart is able to cut Whole Foods' operating costs by a generous 3 percent, or about $450 million a year. Taxed at 35 percent and capitalized on a multiple of 10, those savings are worth just under $3 billion today, roughly the same as Amazon's premium. Walmart would be irrational to pay more, especially since it would also have to cover a $400 million break fee. This math applies to any interloper. And even hefty cost cuts wouldn't make Whole Foods' Ebitda expand enough for the after-tax return on an acquisition to exceed the 8.6 percent weighted average cost of capital Morningstar attaches to the company. Whatever magic Mr. Bezos has in mind, his advisers have done the trick of making his deal hard to beat."
0,2017-06-20," The conglomerate was supposed to be dead, a relic of a bygone era of corporate America. Investors, we have been repeatedly told, want smaller, nimbler, more focused companies. And yet there is Amazon. Just when it seemed that sprawling empire building had gone out of vogue — eulogies were written last week for General Electric after Jeffrey Immelt, its chief executive, retired under pressure from shareholders — Amazon announced that it was buying Whole Foods for $13.4 billion. The deal will put Amazon in the brick-and-mortar grocery store business, which will exist alongside an ever-increasing bevy of disparate interests: the selling of everything from electronics to toothpaste online; payments and credit; cloud computing; production and distribution of movies and television programming; book publishing; shipping and logistics operations; and on and on. It is actually a myth that conglomerates disappeared. They are now just dressed up with a bit of Silicon Valley flair, and dress down in the boardroom, with chief executives who wear sneakers. Amazon is just one of these new-economy conglomerates. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is another. Facebook is quickly becoming a conglomerate, too. Michael C. Jensen, a professor emeritus at Harvard Business School, famously — and successfully — made the case in the 1970s and 1980s that conglomerates like RJR, which owned tobacco and food brands like Nabisco, wasted ""billions in unproductive capital expenditures and organizational inefficiencies."" That is very likely true of today's tech-enabled conglomerates, too, which are spending, and often losing, tens of billions of dollars annually on all sorts of projects and acquisitions that may or may not turn out to be successful. But investors are seemingly willing to give these new behemoths a free pass in the name of growth and innovation — until they aren't. If there is any lesson from the last breed of industrial conglomerates, it is that there is a natural life cycle to most of them. The model begins like this: A company that is successful in one area turns itself into a conglomerate by using its free cash flow to finance the development or acquisition of businesses in other areas — at first, ones that are similar to their current business, and later often ones that are farther afield. And then the company does this again and again. When such an economic machine works, it works extraordinarily well. But when any one of the major levers in the machine breaks or even stalls, the entire enterprise comes under pressure. Shareholders start complaining that the sum of the parts would be worth more separately than together. ""You look at companies that got really big in the world, the record is not very good,"" Charles T. Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway — the world's largest conglomerate — told investors several years ago. His business partner, Warren Buffett, stunned shareholders this year when he suggested that he expected shares of Berkshire to rise immediately after his death because of speculation that the company would be broken up and thus would be worth more. (He and Mr. Munger both believe that Berkshire is better off intact, but Mr. Buffett thinks investors' knee-jerk reaction will be to believe the opposite.) When it comes to Amazon (or Alphabet, or any of the new conglomerates), the question is whether there is something fundamentally different about these businesses given their grounding in digital information — especially as they expand into complex brick-and-mortar operations like upscale supermarkets. In an age of big data and artificial intelligence, are businesses that look disparate really similar? And can one company's leadership really oversee so many different businesses? When does it become too big to manage? Google's own internal list of top-10 principles seems to include an anti-conglomerate provision: ""It's best to do one thing really, really well."" Leaving aside the question of whether that maxim may have been more suitable to the Google of a decade ago, it certainly hasn't stopped the company from jumping into all sorts of businesses outside its flagship search and advertising business. Some of these businesses — which include Android, YouTube, Waze, Nest Labs, self-driving cars and internet distribution — have been more successful than others. Most of these were brought under the Google umbrella through acquisition, evidence of how the company has used the enormous proceeds of its advertising business to subsidize its entrance into all sorts of other enterprises. Facebook, too, is expanding its offerings through acquisition, buying Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus VR. And for now, there are no obvious signs that looking after a wider array of businesses is weakening the management at Alphabet, Facebook or, for that matter, Amazon. In fact, a recent article in the Yale Law Journal made a compelling case that Amazon has built perhaps the ultimate economic mousetrap — one impervious to the natural life cycle of a conglomerate, but one that might ultimately prove to be anticompetitive. The author, Lina M. Khan, a Yale Law student who has written about antitrust law and competition policy, argued that Amazon had created a ""platform market"" and can use its size and scale to subsidize its entrance into new businesses through predatory pricing. ""The economics of platform markets create incentives for a company to pursue growth over profits, a strategy that investors have rewarded,"" Ms. Khan wrote. ""Under these conditions, predatory pricing becomes highly rational — even as existing doctrine treats it as irrational and therefore implausible."" Even more provocatively, she contends that Amazon's role as both a distributor and cloud provider for many of its competitors gives it an unfair advantage. ""This dual role also enables a platform to exploit information collected on companies using its services to undermine them as competitors,"" Ms. Khan wrote. Amazon has thus far been left alone by regulators because it has helped reduce prices of most products. It is not a natural monopoly. ""Can prices ever be 'too low'?"" the Federal Trade Commission asks on its website. ""The short answer is yes, but not very often."" On its webpage about predatory pricing, the agency explains how the government thinks about competition. ""A firm's independent decision to reduce prices to a level below its own costs does not necessarily injure competition, and, in fact, may simply reflect particularly vigorous competition."" That may be true. But in Amazon's case, it has the potential to become so dominant in so many areas that its impact could be more than simply lowering prices for consumers; it could put large companies out of business. Were that to happen, this new breed of Silicon Valley conglomerates may become more powerful — and resilient — than the 20th-century conglomerates of yore. If Amazon were to use its acquisition of Whole Foods, along with the profits from its other businesses, to lower prices so much that it put out of business a company like Walmart, with its 1.5 million United States employees, would that be a good outcome? Or is that just a natural part of capitalism? The view of Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is clear. The man who is assembling the 21st century's most fearsome new conglomerate once explained his view of competition this way: ""Your margin is my opportunity."""
1,2017-06-20," SEATTLE — For many people, buying clothing online is not worth the hassle of getting a pair of pants or a shirt that does not fit. Many retailers have sought to eliminate that risk by offering free returns on clothing, but now Amazon is going even further. On Tuesday morning, the company revealed a new program called Prime Wardrobe that allows people to order clothing — from three to 15 items at a time — without actually buying it. Amazon will charge them only for the items they keep. Customers can return the items they don't want in a resealable box with the preprinted shipping label that the order came in. The service will be an option only for members of Amazon Prime, the company's membership service, which, for $99 a year, gives customers fast shipping at no extra charge, a streaming video service and other benefits. The company did not say when Prime Wardrobe would be available. It is hard to predict what impact this will have on the company's clothing sales, but it follows a pattern at Amazon of eliminating so-called friction points to online shopping that have made it surprisingly successful in the apparel category. By the end of this year, analysts expect that Amazon will become the largest apparel retailer in the United States, at a time when many traditional brick-and-mortar retailers are closing stores or filing for bankruptcy. And retailers received a new reason to worry about Amazon's ambitions in recent days after the company announced it had agreed to acquire Whole Foods, the high-end grocery chain, for $13.4 billion. Amazon isn't the first online company to offer a try-before-you-buy program. The eyewear retailer Warby Parker has long let customers try on up to five pairs of glasses at home for as long as five days, with no obligation to buy any of them. Another online clothing retailer, Stitch Fix, offers a similar home try-on service. To use it, customers must pay a nonrefundable $20 ""styling fee"" through which they receive personalized clothing recommendations. The fee can be applied as a credit toward any items the customer buys. Prime Wardrobe will let customers try on more than a million items of clothing, accessories and shoes from brands including Calvin Klein, Levi's, Adidas, Hugo Boss and Lacoste without buying them. Customers will then have seven days to return the items they don't want. Earlier this year, JackThreads, an apparel start-up that also allowed people to try on clothing at home, shut down. Previously, Amazon has tried to make its customers more comfortable with shopping for clothing online by offering free shipping on returns of most apparel. This allowed customers to buy clothing and receive refunds for any items they returned. Free shipping on returns can easily erode the profits of an online retailer if customers use the option often, but Amazon can ease the sting somewhat because it also collects fees from its Prime members. With Prime Wardrobe, Amazon will actually discourage clothing returns in a subtle way. The retailer will cut 10 percent off the purchase price of an order for anyone who keeps three to four items, and 20 percent off for anyone who keeps five or more items."
2,2017-06-20, Amazon agreed to buy the grocery chain Whole Foods for $13.4 billion.
3,2017-06-20," Blood is running in the retail aisle. Sears, the most iconic name in American retailing, told its investors in March that ""substantial doubt exists related to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern."" The appliance retailer HH Gregg went defunct at the end of May, and once-celebrated companies like Bebe and Limited are desperately trying to survive as online-only storefronts. The carnage has spread beyond empty shopping malls and big-box stores to the grocery trade. Last week, a poor earnings report cost Kroger, the nation's second-largest food retailer, 19 percent of its stock market value in a matter of hours — and that was before Amazon announced its acquisition of Whole Foods Market. So why might Amazon, the giant of online shopping, want to spend $13.4 billion on 461 brick-and-mortar stores of the sort other retailers are shedding left and right, along with a coffee roaster, 11 food distribution centers and manufacturing plants that do things like bake bread and gut fish? One obvious possibility is that Amazon could try to cut delivery times and costs by letting shoppers order online and then pick up their goods at the nearest Whole Foods. Another is that Amazon, for some reason, wants to grab a share of the low-profit grocery business, where online sales have not taken off, and see whether its technological wizardry can revolutionize food shopping. But there may be a less obvious explanation of Amazon's interest in Whole Foods: Perhaps it wants to be a bit more like Apple. There's no question that Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has built a hugely successful business. But a large part that business comes from selling the products of others. Only a tiny fraction of its retail sales — its Kindle e-reader, its Echo home control center, the audio books published by its Audible subsidiary, its Amazon Original videos — are exclusive to Amazon. The company makes money on the rest only if the prices on its website, with delivery costs added in, are below those elsewhere. What that means is that Amazon's margins are skinny. Last year its business that provides cloud-based web services for businesses and governments, with $12 billion of revenue, brought in three times the pre-tax profit Amazon reaped from $125 billion in retail sales. How to solve this problem? An envious glance at one of their company's best-known competitors might offer Amazon executives an answer. In 2016, not a stellar year, Apple Inc. reported net income equal to 21 percent of sales — a ratio 12 times higher than Amazon's. A large part of Apple's profit is generated at its retail stores. Apple doesn't disclose such information, but its Apple Stores are believed to have annual sales above $5,500 per square foot. No other retailer comes close. The corresponding figure for Macy's, to take one example, is around $200. Apple doesn't need flashy stores in expensive locations to distribute phones and computers; those can be ordered on the internet. The Apple Stores, meticulously planned from their online appointment books to the transaction processing system that emails a receipt before you've walked out the door, sell an experience, not electronics. Their purpose is to persuade customers that Apple has extraordinarily exciting products for which premium prices are entirely justified. Whole Foods started out with a similar idea, but its approach hasn't been working well. Its customer count dropped 2.6 percent last year as shoppers rebelled against high prices for food that didn't seem worth the premium. In a phone call with investors on May 10, John Mackey, the company's chief executive, said Whole Foods was striving for ""lower costs, lower prices and higher sales."" That doesn't sound like the mantra of a high-end retailer. Aside from its troubled grocery business, though, Whole Foods brings Amazon two important assets: affluent customers and locations in high-income neighborhoods. Amazon might use these assets to broaden its business in a way it cannot do online. Online retailing allows retailers access to millions of customers, but that's not always a benefit. One of the challenges of e-commerce is that it's difficult to segment the market. Every customer has access to the same web pages. Online merchants may take advantage of information about individuals' browsing history and past purchases to offer different prices to some than to others, but there's no way to make online shopping a special experience with Apple-style margins. For that, it's still critical to bring customers in the door. That's where Whole Foods comes in. Whole Foods's stores are sizeable, averaging nearly 40,000 square feet. Imagine Amazon carving out a fifth of that space, with separate entrances, and creating boutiques with well-trained staff and dynamic merchandising. Under the Amazon name or some newly created brand, those boutiques could sell exclusive products and services to shoppers on their way to grab a kale-and-red-currant salad for lunch or a pound of locally raised grass-fed beef for dinner, without detracting from Amazon's online business. They could sell excitement at profit margins Amazon will never achieve from selling books and backpacks on the internet — profit margins that look a lot more like Apple's."

Just Tweet Him"" (Inside Wealth column, Business Day, June 16): Jeff Bezos's generosity is an example for all who care about making life better today and for future generations. I will add my voice to the crowdsourcing and propose an option: Mr. Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, should give his money to the more than 700 community foundations across our country, and urge others to give to their community foundations. It's fine to place faith in just one issue area, but a community foundation can help make the most impact on a range of issues in the place someone cares about. They are experts on local challenges, from homelessness and hunger to the environment and education. By diversifying his giving and working with the experts, Mr. Bezos can be proud that his success can make a difference for others.

For that, it's still critical to bring customers in the door. That's where Whole Foods comes in. Whole Foods's stores are sizeable, averaging nearly 40,000 square feet. Imagine Amazon carving out a fifth of that space, with separate entrances, and creating boutiques with well-trained staff and dynamic merchandising. Under the Amazon name or some newly created brand, those boutiques could sell exclusive products and services to shoppers on their way to grab a kale-and-red-currant salad for lunch or a pound of locally raised grass-fed beef for dinner, without detracting from Amazon's online business. They could sell excitement at profit margins Amazon will never achieve from selling books and backpacks on the internet — profit margins that look a lot more like Apple's."

Just Tweet Him"" (Inside Wealth column, Business Day, June 16): Jeff Bezos's generosity is an example for all who care about making life better today and for future generations. I will add my voice to the crowdsourcing and propose an option: Mr. Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, should give his money to the more than 700 community foundations across our country, and urge others to give to their community foundations. It's fine to place faith in just one issue area, but a community foundation can help make the most impact on a range of issues in the place someone cares about. They are experts on local challenges, from homelessness and hunger to the environment and education. By diversifying his giving and working with the experts, Mr. Bezos can be proud that his success can make a difference for others.

0,2017-06-22," The biologist, performer and author Julia Serano is a leading transfeminist thinker and the author of ""Whipping Girl,"" which Jill Soloway, the creator of the Amazon series ""Transparent,"" cites as a major influence and the first book she gives to transgender friends, like Caitlyn Jenner. Based on Ms. Serano's experiences as a trans woman who transitioned in 2002, and deep engagement with feminist theory, her manifesto links transphobia with sexism and is a call to rethink attitudes toward femininity. She worked at the University of California, Berkeley, for 17 years doing postdoctoral research in genetics and evolutionary biology and is now a full-time writer and activist in Oakland. The following interview has been edited and condensed.  One of the main ideas ""Whipping Girl"" became known for is ""trans-misogyny."" Please explain.  After I transitioned I experienced a combination of discrimination — for being a transgender person and also for being a woman. Trans-misogyny describes this complex interplay between transphobia and misogyny that trans women are faced with.  What's an example?  Once in San Francisco I saw a trans woman dressed like an average feminine woman walk past a straight couple on the street. The man turned to the woman and sneered, ""Did you see all that crap he's wearing?"" He was referring to her dress and jewelry and makeup and all that. If a trans man had walked by, they might also have ridiculed him for being transgender. But I doubt very much they would have made fun of his masculine clothing.  When did you become a feminist? And why?  I identified as a feminist, or feminist ally, throughout my adult life. But after my transition around 2002, I began writing about my experiences with sexism as a trans woman, and that led me to become more passionate about and involved in feminism.  ""Whipping Girl"" is in many ways a celebration and defense of feminine gender expression. Why did you feel femininity needed a cheerleader?  Some people have feminine traits or gravitate toward feminine gender expression. Historically these things have been ridiculed in comparison to masculine interests and gender expression. If people are going to make jokes about transgender people, they usually single out trans women. The underlying theme of the joke is how ridiculous it is that someone who was a man would decide to be a woman, to be feminine. The assumption is that femaleness and femininity are inferior. That's part of the joke. Just as feminists have long argued that women are men's equals, we should also be saying that femininity is masculinity's equal.   Most feminist and women's groups today include trans women. But there are still tensions. Recently the Nigerian novelist and feminist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie sparked controversy with comments suggesting that trans women aren't really women.  I don't think Adichie is opposed to transgender people per se. But she did go out of her way to make the case that trans women belong in a separate category. Feminism is about putting an end to sexism, and as a feminist I personally want to see the end of sexism in all its forms: homophobia or transphobia or traditional sexism or whatever. I don't see why trans women need to be forced out into our own group separate from women in order to end sexism. It's worth pointing out that there was a time when a lot of straight feminists similarly wanted to isolate lesbians. They accused them of being a threat to women and women's liberation. We see how wrong that was now.  Have you felt pressured to conform to certain norms of femininity?  It's complicated. Just like women more generally, trans women vary a lot. Some are high femme. Some butch. I call myself a femme tomboy — I have a little of both. But there is a sense that to be taken seriously as a trans woman, you should fit into the ideal of femininity as much as possible. Yet trans women who are very feminine are often accused of going over the top and presenting a stereotyped idea of what women should be. A lot of my trans women friends identify as queer or lesbian so they are not canonically feminine. We are very diverse, but the trans women who get media attention tend to fit the more feminine ideal or expectations.  Do you swing optimistic or pessimistic in terms of your trans activism?  In spite of the many obstacles, I tend to think we progress a little all the time. But since the election, I have been shocked at the rise of the alt-right and about how outspoken strongly sexist, racist, queer-phobic voices have become.  You began life as a male; fast-forward almost five decades and you're a trans woman feminist activist. Could you have imagined that?  Not in the way you might be thinking. It's true that when I was a young boy, I couldn't have imagined I would be a trans woman. But as soon as I learned about trans people, I thought transitioning might be a possible pathway for me. But being trans has influenced me in surprising ways. Not being able to take my gender for granted from a young age forced me to become a critical thinker. And facing the obstacles of living my life as an out trans woman has made me more self-confident — not just about my trans identity, but about everything. As a young adult, I mostly saw myself as a biologist and musician, but nowadays I'm working as a writer and activist.  Do you have any sisterly advice for Chelsea Manning as she embarks on her public life as a trans woman?  I don't feel comfortable addressing her or anyone specifically. But I would say to younger people in general that when it comes to trans people and transitioning, the only thing you can do is try not to let other people's expectations dictate what you do or what you become."
0,2017-06-23," The next time you check out at Whole Foods, you might meet my friend Esther at the register. In a few years, you might meet a robot. Or no one at all. Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods is expected to revolutionize the grocery business, accelerating a trend toward increasing automation and the elimination of cashiers and other human workers. The Amazon Go store in Seattle, devoid of sales clerks and checkout lines, offers a glimpse of what this ""just walk out"" grocery shopping experience might look like. I'm not looking forward to it. While interactions with cashiers may seem insignificant, or at times even a nuisance, they also foster sociability between strangers. I first met Esther 10 years ago when she worked as a cashier at a mom-and-pop bakery in Manhattan, where I'd come to study how adults over 65 used neighborhood spaces to develop social connections that helped them avoid social isolation and live independently. Esther provided care along with pastries to the older people who congregated at the bakery. She knew exactly how her patrons took their coffees and brought orders to the table for people struggling with canes and walkers. She shared her homemade soup with an octogenarian who came each evening, patiently listened to customers' long-winded stories, and admired pictures of grandchildren. A computer could have done many of Esther's tasks, perhaps more efficiently. But for anyone who's ever experienced an alarmed electronic voice at self-checkout blaring that you have an ""unauthorized item in the bagging area"" when you just don't see the point of bagging Tic Tacs, technology also has its shortcomings. Besides, while a robot might be able to learn that you take your coffee black with two sugars, how special does that make you feel? Ephemeral contact with cashiers and other service workers can be especially important to people at risk of isolation, such as older people who live alone, those with chronic illnesses and the unemployed. My sister, who suffers from schizophrenia, values her interactions with employees at the CVS where she picks up her medications. ""It makes me happy,"" she said about the cashier's friendly hello. She mentioned a pharmacist who rings up her monthly refills: ""She always asks how I am, says, 'Oh, I haven't seen you in a while, where have you been?' It really helped when I got out of the hospital."" Six years ago, she spent three months in Bellevue Hospital because of a psychotic break, and at first didn't want to take medication or attend treatment sessions, worried that the people around her had weapons. Despite that initial resistance, she has faithfully taken the drugs that control her delusions and has not returned to the hospital since. Her exchanges with the pharmacy staff served as informal check-ins that gave her a little extra help adhering to an unfamiliar medication regimen. Services like Walgreens' express pharmacy kiosks, which allow customers to reduce the interaction required to refill a prescription in person, mean encounters like these may already be dwindling. Fleeting retail interactions can also help people during major life transitions. I learned this when I ended a 13-year relationship and moved to San Francisco, a city where I knew almost no one. I worked from home and could have gone days without speaking to another human being. But I discovered how quickly I could become a regular at the coffee shops, eateries and bars I frequented. Service workers often filled in important connective social tissue before I worked up enough nerve to chat with other customers. A few friendly words with the servers and bartenders made me feel less alone. Eventually some became friends. At the same time, San Francisco was a pioneer in automation. At Eatsa, a quinoa bowl joint, you don't have to interact with any other humans. You just order on your phone, and a ""personalized cubby"" spits out your food. Robots make coffee at Cafe X, and self-driving food delivery robots roam the streets of the Mission District. We seem to have fewer and fewer opportunities to interact with people, especially those outside of our usual social circles, of different races, classes or nationalities. In our polarized political climate, we cannot afford to squander them. That's one reason I choose to ride the bus to work as a college professor, side-by-side with Walmart employees and other retail workers at the mall where the bus route terminates. Most people who can afford a car would rather drive to the mall, reducing the chances of serendipitous conversation with strangers. Will they soon be able to avoid them in the mall, too? What's good for business is not always good for people. We need to consider the trade-offs of increasing automation and use our dollars to push for the kind of shopping experience we want and the kind of communities we want to live in. Next time you're at the store and have the opportunity to bypass the register, spare a few moments to chat with the cashier instead. You can always shop on Amazon at home."
0,2017-06-25," To the Editor: Re ""Amazon to Buy Whole Foods for $13 Billion"" (front page, June 17): As I read the article, I had memories of my parents going to the local grocer down the street to buy the food we would be eating that night. My mother or father would talk to the grocer about his family, and the grocer would ask about our family. He would wrap our meat in brown paper, and other items were placed in a sack. The vegetables were seasonal and from a local farm. Now I am not saying that I want to go back to the local grocer days, because I really enjoy the exotic fruits and vegetables that I get from the big grocery stores. But there is something that doesn't seem right about ordering groceries online. Have Americans become so unsocial and disconnected? I like it when the person at the checkout counter remembers that I like potato chips and tells me about the special on my favorite ones. Sometimes the other customers would give me a good recipe. Connecting with people and connecting with your computer are not the same. ANTONIA I. DELUCA, BOLIVIA, N.C. To the Editor: The chief executive of Whole Foods, John Mackey, has built an empire on giving shelf space to products that have transformed American food culture for the better, increasing the variety and quality of organic and plant-based options in particular. At the same time, Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, has changed the retail landscape in ways that make shopping easier for consumers and thereby improve our lives. These two innovators will merge the ideals of conscious capitalism and wicked efficiency, which should be a boon for healthy, humane and sustainable food companies.

To the Editor: Re ""Amazon's Move Signals the End of the Line for Cashiers"" (Business Day, June 19): Like it or not, history tells us that change in all aspects of life, occasioned by technology, is inevitable. Exactly what changes will be wrought by Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods is hard to say, but one thing is inevitable about this and almost all technology-inspired change: Jobs will be lost. As automation of service, and even professional, jobs occurs with increasing rapidity, none of us are exempt. Rather than bemoaning this result or attempting to thwart it, we need to figure out how to provide jobs and income for the ever-increasing number of people whose jobs succumb to automation. The failure to do so will have catastrophic consequences — either in further increases in income and wealth disparities, or in the creation of a permanently oppressed underclass, or in revolution, or all three. ALAN MEISEL, PITTSBURGH To the Editor: Re ""Amazon's Growing Monopoly Bite,"" by Lina M. Khan (Op-Ed, June 21): As an independent sales rep, I'm all too aware of the havoc caused by Amazon's low prices. The destruction of competition, however, is by no means solely Amazon's doing; it's the manufacturers and distributors who always award larger dealers better pricing at the expense of smaller brick-and-mortar stores. Better sales management and implementation of minimum advertised pricing (known as MAP) is a simple, effective and perfectly legal way to protect and diversify competition instead of enabling the ""race to the bottom"" of product pricing and low profitability. When retailers can compete by offering better service and not simply better pricing, everyone wins, Amazon customers included. ERIC KLEIN, MONTCLAIR, N.J."
0,2017-06-26," A week ago, I began testing Amazon's Echo Show, a new smart speaker that has a touch screen. For due diligence on the device's capabilities, I ran it through a battery of tests, including its ability to play podcasts, book a restaurant table and list movie showtimes. Halfway through, I started to come to a conclusion: Using the new smart speaker and its screen is not much different from asking Siri on an iPad to book a restaurant table or saying ""OK, Google"" to an Android-based phone to create a calendar appointment. Keep those similarities in mind as the Echo Show becomes available on Wednesday, joining Amazon's expanding family of Echo products. The Echo speakers are widely adored in homes, where people have put Alexa, Amazon's virtual assistant that controls Echo, to work on tasks like creating shopping lists, setting kitchen timers, playing music and turning on the lights. With the $230 Echo Show, Alexa has gained some new capabilities. The touch screen means that you can ask Alexa to place a video call to a friend, pull up a YouTube video on making ice cream and show you lyrics when you play music. And unlike a tablet or smartphone, the stationary Echo Show sits at a fixed angle and stays plugged in for power at all times, similar to a digital picture frame. But the device's kinship to a smartphone's or tablet's capabilities are unmistakable. Asking Alexa to do a video call with Echo Show reminded me of asking Siri to do a FaceTime call on an iPhone. Ditto for when I asked Alexa what my day looked like on the Echo Show, which produced the same summary of events as when I asked Google the same question on an Android phone. After a week of tests, while I concluded that the product is ideal on a kitchen counter or an office desk, I also decided it was superfluous if you already own an Echo speaker and a smartphone or tablet. Whether or not you will be persuaded to buy one will probably hinge on your affinity for Alexa. The setup process for the Echo Show was one of the easiest and fastest I have ever experienced: Just plug it in and enter your Wi-Fi password and Amazon credentials. From there, I could start putting Alexa to work. (If you use third-party services like Spotify, you have to log in to those as well.) The Echo Show's screen constantly stayed on with a background photo of my choice. It displayed the time while rotating through captions showing future calendar events, the weather and tips on questions I could ask Alexa. Video calling and video playback are the most important features of the Echo Show. After a command like ""Alexa, show me how to roast a duck from YouTube,"" the screen loaded a list of YouTube videos; each video is numbered, so you could ask Alexa to play a specific clip by naming the number. You could also ask Alexa to place a call to another Echo customer. When I tried it, the Alexa app synchronized with my smartphone's address book to determine who else was using an Echo. Then just by asking Alexa to call the name of a contact, I could immediately commence a video call. What was also nice about the Echo Show's being stationary is that it remained fixed on a flattering angle of my face. (If you're tired of staring up people's nostrils on FaceTime calls, you'll know what I mean.) There's another task that the Echo Show handled better than the Echo speaker: shopping on Amazon. By saying, for example, ""Alexa, order me some batteries,"" you get the screen to show a list of batteries to choose from. By contrast, with the Echo speaker, the device could only reorder batteries you had bought before — or, if you hadn't ordered batteries before, choose a pack of batteries for you. For audio, the Echo Show included two small stereo speakers. They sounded loud and clear but lacking in bass. Compared with fancy speakers, the Echo Show sounded average, but it's adequate for watching YouTube videos in the kitchen or streaming music if you aren't a nitpicky audiophile. The Echo Show is buggy. In my tests with a fellow product reviewer as well as an Amazon spokesman, video calls were inconsistent. While video calls from my apartment looked clear and sounded good, other calls placed from the New York Times building failed to show any video — and, soon after, the calls disconnected. (In both locations, I used a strong Wi-Fi connection.) There were also some quirks with so-called Skills, which are essentially third-party apps that you can install to expand Alexa's capabilities. For example, for looking up recipes in the kitchen, I tried a skill by AllRecipes. But when I told Alexa, ""Show me how to make pasta,"" the device loaded a list of recipes from AllRecipes.com, and then I had trouble quitting the app. The command ""Go home"" was supposed to quit the AllRecipes Skill, but it got stuck until I said, ""Alexa, quit."" When I was shopping, the Echo Show displayed a pared-down list of items from Amazon. For example, when I asked Alexa to buy a dog bed, the screen showed only 18 results for dog beds. But searching ""dog bed"" on Amazon.com brought up hundreds. That's not to say that more is better, but shopping on the Echo Show will make you wonder if you are missing out on better options. What I found most baffling about the Echo Show was that the screen always stayed on. Even when I asked Alexa to turn the screen off, it dimmed the screen and showed the time. While that made it act like a digital clock, the background of the screen was still lit up black, emitting a faint glow in the dark. What's more, the screen turned back on when the camera detected motion. In other words, light sleepers will not want an Echo Show on their night stands. Amazon said that third-party Skills had not yet been finalized for the Echo Show, and that for shopping, the device displayed only the top search results to simplify the interface for customers. The company did not have a clear explanation for my video-calling issues. But the worst part about the Echo Show is its aesthetic design. Reminiscent of a black doorstop, the Echo Show looks like an uninspired piece of tech that you'd find in a Brookstone store or SkyMall catalog. The Echo Show's greatest strengths are its stationary applications: getting a quick glance at your calendars while checking the time, for instance, or having a dedicated TV screen in the kitchen for learning recipes. Calendar addicts in the office, people who cook with Alexa and, more broadly, Alexa fans with multiple Echo products deployed throughout the home will love having another Echo, this time with a screen. But the average person would be wise to wait before buying the Echo Show. The device is the priciest in the Echo family — $50 more than the Echo speaker and $180 more than the Echo Dot, the miniature version of the speaker. And it remains to be seen what third-party companies do with applications designed for an always-on screen that stays put. Until then, you could always grab a tablet you already own, put it on a stand and leave it plugged in. The results will most likely be the same."
0,2017-06-27," Europe has long been tough on American tech companies. From Facebook to Google to Amazon and Apple, few have escaped the glare. European regulators have dinged the behemoths on antitrust, privacy and tax issues. This week, Europe's tension with American tech giants rose another notch. European Union officials on Tuesday slapped Google with a record fine of 2.4 billion euros, or $2.7 billion, over the company's search services, writes Mark Scott, a technology reporter at The New York Times. In particular, the E.U. said, Google diverted traffic from competitors' services to favor its own comparison shopping site. The case is a part of a long-running series of investigations that the E.U. has opened against Google. European officials are also looking into Android, the company's mobile software, and some of Google's advertising products. It will take some time — perhaps years of appeals and legal maneuvering — before the record fine is paid. There are other issues to untangle, such as how Google will comply with the decision to crimp its power. Still, the record sum levied by the E.U. speaks volumes about how tough Europe is willing to be on these tech companies, whose hold on people around the globe is only increasing. If Europe intended to make a statement, it succeeded."
0,2017-06-28," In the late 1970s, Jef Raskin, a pioneering technologist who was one of Apple's earliest employees, sketched out a radical vision for the future of computing. Computers, he argued, should work like home appliances. The ideal computer would require almost no learning curve or upkeep. You wouldn't have to upgrade its operating system, say, or install different programs to do things. Instead, like a washing machine or a vacuum cleaner, the device would perform a narrow set of useful tasks with the push of a button or two. Mr. Raskin started a project at Apple to realize his vision — the first cheap, easy-to-use computer for everyone. He called it Macintosh after his favorite type of apple, and he assembled a legendary team to build it. But it was not to be. Mr. Raskin's vision clashed with the loftier ideas of many at Apple, including Steve Jobs, who eventually took over the Mac team and steered it toward building the general-purpose personal computer that redefined the tech industry. Alienated and frustrated, Mr. Raskin left Apple in 1982, and spent much of the rest of his life trying to create the ""information appliance"" of his dreams. He died in 2005, never quite getting there. But now, all of a sudden, Mr. Raskin's information appliance is here, sitting on my kitchen counter. It's called the Echo Show, and it is the latest incarnation of the Echo, Amazon's voice-controlled smart speaker that has become a surprise hit. The Echo Show is easy to describe; it's an Echo with a screen, and you control it the same way you do any other Echo — by talking to Alexa, its cheery assistant. As my colleague Brian X. Chen wrote in his review, the Show is far from perfect; it has some bugs and you get the feeling that Amazon is still searching for a killer purpose for it. But these are quibbles. The Echo Show is a remarkable machine, not just for what it is now but for the way it clarifies Amazon's vision of the future of computing. It's becoming the model for a new kind of communal, household computer — a resurrection of Mr. Raskin's idea of an information appliance, as opposed to Mr. Jobs's vision of an all-purpose PC. One measure of the power of this vision is how quickly Amazon's rivals are racing to copy it; both Apple and Google have their own takes on the Echo. It's questionable how far these rivals will get. Amazon's business model, which depends on millions of households buying millions of goods, is uniquely suited to selling Echos at low prices, because Amazon is certain it can make money on the device from extra Amazon purchases. (The lowest-priced Echo, the Dot, sells for $50; the new Show, available to the public starting Wednesday, sells for $230, but you get $100 off if you buy two.) What's more, Amazon is far ahead. The Echo is much more useful than Google Home, which was released two years after Amazon's device, and the Apple HomePod speaker will not ship until the end of the year. Given that lead, the Echo is beginning to look unstoppable. It is well on the way to becoming the operating system for suburbia. I suspect you're scoffing. The primary knock on Mr. Raskin's information appliance was that it didn't do a whole lot. This is also the main criticism of the Echo and, now, the Echo Show. These devices can't do anything you can't do on your phone, PC or tablet. That's true, but it also kind of misses the point. You can make toast in the oven, but you have a toaster because it's designed to perform a specific task reliably and without any fuss. That's the point of the information appliance, too. There's a whole lot the Echo Show won't do. It won't do email. It won't do the web. It won't play first-person shooters. It is emphatically, purposely not a general-purpose computer. But what it does do — play music and videos, make video calls, tell you the news, tell you the time and weather, and shop at Amazon — it does with such surpassing ease that it feels like a magic trick. There are a few reasons for that. One is the Show's unusual and quietly innovative interface. Dave Limp, Amazon's senior vice president for devices, told me that when the company was first designing the Show, it tried to use the same interface that it used for its tablet computers. But the team soon realized this didn't work. For one thing, the Echo Show is designed to be used just with your voice — the screen adds extra information, but you have to look at it only when you specifically ask for visual information (such as when you want a video). A standard mobile operating system, which is heavily visual, just wouldn't work. Another reason a tablet interface wouldn't have worked is that it felt too much like a computer, and one overriding design goal of the Echo and the Echo Show was to hide any relationship to anything computerlike. The Show's operating system, memory, storage and other specifications are completely hidden from users. The Echo does have a version of apps, known as ""skills,"" but they aren't anything like smartphone apps. You install them just by asking Alexa to enable them, and when you want to use one, you just name it. To watch a video, you just ask for the video — you don't load up a web browser or the YouTube app and then search for it. ""It's a very different mental model than the traditional computer, smartphone or tablet, where you have to think of which app you want to use and then open it and then dive in,"" Mr. Limp wrote in an email. The Echo Show has one other advantage over smartphones and tablets: It's always there in the same spot. Your phone and tablet move around the house. Often they are nearby, but sometimes they aren't. That uncertainty makes them less useful for the kind of ambient computing tasks the Echo is good at. When you are in the kitchen and need to look up a recipe, you could find your iPad to call it up. But the Echo Show is always there, so you and everyone else at home come to rely on it — you know that when you call out for it, it will always answer. Such communal, stationary devices are not unusual in our homes. All the appliances are stationary and communal, from the fridge to the washing machine. We also have some appliances whose sole purpose is to provide us with information and entertainment — bedside clocks and TVs, for instance. Mr. Limp said these informational appliances provided a ""mental model"" for the Show's design, which got me thinking about the expansiveness of Amazon's ambitions here. The Show has a seven-inch screen. There's no reason the screen could not be slightly bigger — an iPad-size one that clings to your bathroom mirror, for instance. Or it could be much, much bigger. In fact, let me go out on a limb: Within a couple of years, I bet Amazon will make its own TV that will work just like the Echo Show. Because if you are trying to create the perfect home appliance, there is no better target than the biggest screen in the house."

2,2017-06-29," I'm rooting for Amazon and companies like Peapod and FreshDirect to hurry up and complete their revolution of the grocery delivery business so that it can be almost as good as it was 60 years ago. Without the benefit of drones — or for that matter, the internet — here's how it worked at our home in Westchester County, north of New York City. Twice a week, my mother would phone the Parkway grocery store in town and rattle off her needs to one of the establishment's three owners. They would hurry through the staples and dry goods and then spend a bit more time mulling possibilities with meats and produce after Mom asked, ""What looks good?"" A few hours later, a man named Pete would chug up our driveway in the Parkway delivery truck and carry a sturdy box — always a box, never a bag — directly to our kitchen. Wearing his long white grocery store apron, Pete would just leave the box on the table. He put anything perishable in the refrigerator. This twice-weekly ritual came to mind the other day as I read a long article in this paper about the challenges of home delivery. It noted that ""delivering food requires military precision."" The report was accompanied by many, many photos underscoring the enormous task of delivering perishables to people's homes. It also reminded me of the twice-a-week deliveries we received from Gene in his Emmadine Farms milk truck. There was no need to phone ahead. Gene just showed up every Monday and Thursday in a step van that had a picture of a cow on each side. Water dripped out of the truck, even in winter, as the ice used to keep things cool melted. The most intriguing part, at least to my pre-teenage eyes, was that the truck had no seat. Gene drove it while standing up. And he always wore galoshes. Even in summer, he'd wear unbuckled snow boots (and Bermuda shorts) as he toted his metal carrier with milk, cream and butter straight to our fridge. Of course this marvelous home-delivery system wasn't limited to groceries. In fact, back in the pre-Amazon days just about everything you needed magically showed up at the door. When one of us was sick, Dr. Victor Landes drove over in his dark-blue sedan, wearing the requisite suit and tie and carrying his little black bag. I was always amazed at how the contents of an entire doctor's office seemed to fit into that bag. If we needed medicine, he would phone a prescription to Robbins Pharmacy and a few hours later one of the high school students who worked there part-time would drive over with the order. Every morning James Gray delivered The New York Herald Tribune in his blue VW bus. And each afternoon a woman in a beat-up station wagon delivered the local paper, The Citizen Register. I never caught her name because she managed to toss the paper neatly onto the driveway without ever slowing down. Oil to heat our home in winter was delivered in a smelly truck by the Maui Oil Company. If Mom was having special guests, we'd get a delivery of flowers from Swanson Florist. On Saturday, we often got a delivery of lumber and building supplies from Gerstein's hardware store. And yes, even back then a highlight was the periodic, and tantalizingly unpredictable, arrival of the United Parcel Service truck. Oddly, while so many things have changed, the U.P.S. truck looked exactly the same back then as it does today — except instead of bringing packages from an Amazon warehouse, it carried boxes from Sears or Bonwit Teller or some other department store. Really, I had forgotten that our existence was so quaint — and convenient. It's beginning to meld in my memory with scenes from ""The Music Man"" about the highly anticipated visits of the Wells Fargo wagon by folks in River City, Iowa. I love home delivery, and I'm a big fan of Amazon's one-click shopping. I usually get at least one book a week, and we just received a replacement steam iron and a three-pack of undershorts. Life is good. But it's hardly new or novel. As I recall, the postman always rang twice, but Pete from Parkway just let himself in through the kitchen door."
3,2017-06-29," President Trump may not have meant to, but on Wednesday he seemed to endorse a longer reach for the tax collector. In an angry tweet directed at Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, Mr. Trump chastised the e-commerce giant for ""not paying internet taxes (which they should)."" At the moment, there is no ""internet tax,"" and it is not clear exactly what the president might have had in mind. (The comment was interpolated in a declaration about ""The #AmazonWashingtonPost."" Mr. Bezos owns The Washington Post, which has published articles critical of Mr. Trump; Amazon is a separate company.) The White House did not elaborate. But one possibility is that Mr. Trump was thinking of a proposal to allow state governments to force internet retailers to collect sales taxes from their customers. The bill — called the Marketplace Fairness Act — has been pushed for years by brick-and-mortar retailers like Walmart, which have been losing ground as e-commerce has grown. The bill passed the Senate in 2013, 69 to 27, with bipartisan support. It was reintroduced by a similar coalition in April but faces opposition from House Republicans. If Mr. Trump was implying that Amazon had failed to add taxes where they were due, he was mistaken. The company long balked at collecting sales taxes, but by 2012 it was collecting taxes in California, Texas, Pennsylvania and other states. It even joined its former opponents that year in lobbying Congress to pass federal legislation that would compel its online competitors to follow suit. The idea not only is anathema to anti-tax advocates but also would seem to be at odds with Mr. Trump's own promise that ""we are going to be cutting taxes massively both for the middle class and for companies."" White House aides and Republican lawmakers have frequently despaired over the president's fondness for firing off policy statements on Twitter and other social media platforms. But Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, has said that Mr. Trump will continue to post because ""the fact of the matter is that when he tweets, he gets results."" A tax increase may not, however, be the result his administration is looking for."
0,2017-07-01," As a product designer, Janet Lieberman often finds flaws in everyday tech devices. This was particularly true when it came to vibrators, which she would spend hours shopping for on Amazon. ""I had always bought cheap vibrators and my bedside drawer was a graveyard for them,"" said Ms. Lieberman, 31, who lives in Brooklyn and studied mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""You could replace the batteries but they still would stop working."" After splurging on a pricey vibrator for a boyfriend's birthday that also quickly died, she had an aha moment. ""I realized there was a need for well-engineered sex toys,"" she said. ""There's no real trusted brand and that's what we're setting out to be."" Along with her business partner, Alexandra Fine, whom she met in 2014 through the social networking app Meetup, the pair set out to create a vibrator that was not only well crafted, but made specifically for couples, and women in particular. ""I was living in my grandmother's pool house at the time,"" Ms. Fine, 29, said. She had just graduated from Columbia, where she got a master's degree in clinical psychology ""with a focus on marriage counseling and sex therapy,"" she said. After dozens of prototypes, they came up with their design: an egg-shaped vibrator made of medical-grade silicone that attaches to a woman's nether region by means of two wings. Not only can the device be operated hands-free, it is also designed in a way that does not interfere with a couple's intimacy. ""We wanted to stimulate women with something nonobtrusive so you can look in your partner's eyes,"" Ms. Fine said. They called the device Eva and after raising $575,000 on Indiegogo in 2014, they went to market in early 2015. To date, they have sold over 65,000 units at $105 a pop. Eva, which is manufactured by a company called Dame Products, is among a recent surge of products that embraces feminism as part of its marketing. Like the ""period-proof"" underwear  brand Thinx, it telegraphs a pro-women identity. ""Our continuing mission: to design well-engineered sex toys, to heighten intimacy, and to openly empower the sexual experiences of womankind,"" reads the company's website. The message is amplified through Dame's Instagram account, filled with posts like a pink neon sign that reads ""My Body My Business."" The founders also have the lingo down. ""Our mission is to close the pleasure gap,"" Ms. Fine said during a recent tour of the company's office in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. ""We want to fight any inequality between the sexes, but especially when it comes to sexual practices. We want women to claim their sexual pleasure and own it."" Kristina Monllos, a reporter at Adweek who covers marketing innovation and consumer trends, said that Eva and Thinx appeal to millennial consumers who want ethically and socially-minded products developed for their generation. ""Young people across the gender spectrum are creating brands that live up to and express their own political ideals,"" Ms. Monllos said. ""We're seeing this millennial version now where it's a very stylized aesthetic coupled with these feminist, pro-women ideals."" Ms. Lieberman and Ms. Fine are hoping that their cheerily designed vibrators will help sex toys shed some of their seedier connotations. ""We fall into this really weird space between gag gift, pornography, medical device, health and wellness device and tech gadget,"" Ms. Lieberman said. ""We hope to change that."""
0,2017-07-05," When I was a child, I would watch my grandmother try on dresses and coats she had brought home on ""appro"" (or approbation) from Mrs. Downey's boutique in Dungarvan, Ireland: deciding, at her leisure, what to buy and what to return. Who knew that, decades later, ""appro,"" a.k.a. ""try on,"" would become the way to shop? And not just at Amazon, which recently announced such a service for its Prime members, who are not charged while they mull up to 15 items for a week. In December, Debora LaBudde started Memo, which lets online shoppers try fine jewelry by established and emerging designers for a three-day period. ""The practice of allowing a client to take merchandise home prior to making a purchase has long been a tradition in the jewelry industry, but it's most often reserved for V.I.P. clientele,"" Ms. LaBudde said. But she said she believed ""every client should enjoy the same luxury experience."" Prices range from $350 to $15,000, and insured return shipping is included with delivery. Colleen McKinnie helped found Lyon & Post (tagline: ""Say farewell to fitting rooms""), which sells casual clothing, including active wear and swimwear. ""There's no checkout process,"" Ms. McKinnie said. Members add items to Netflix-style queues by clicking ""Try It On."" Within a day, the top four items are shipped. After a week, members can return whatever they don't want in a prepaid return bag, at which point they are charged only for what they keep. ""Our average retail price is $140, with the overall range sitting between $50 and $500,"" said Ms. McKinnie, who plans to add accessories, shoes and handbags to the stock. After filling out a style profile at Bungalow Clothing, which Rob Wright founded in 2013, customers are paired with stylists. ""From there, they interact via text, phone or email,"" said Mr. Wright, whose partners include the musician John Legend. After previewing items in a ""Dressing Room"" and making any desired adjustments, shoppers get six to 15 items shipped to them for a five-day try-on period. ""Our core demographic is a 35- to 45-year-old mom, of which 80 percent work,"" said Mr. Wright, adding that his average customer spends about $400 in one go. ""They've got money; they just don't have time."" For men who are short on time, there's Bombfell, a men's casual wear subscription service that began shipping to subscribers in 2011. ""When I look at retail, before the internet, I see two buckets,"" said Bernie Yoo, a founder. ""One was a self-service customer: They're confident, they know what looks good on and they can do it all on their own. The second is the full-service customer: They're the ones who would go to personal shoppers or actively seek out help from sales associates."" In an online age, Bombfell is targeted at the latter. ""We're focused on using technology to make the personal styling process much more efficient so we can deliver it at scale,"" Mr. Yoo said. Private-label stock was added to the site last year. Clients choose how often they receive shipments and how many things they receive (the average price is $85), and they have seven days to decide on which items to keep. Nina Lowe and Andrea Campbell, who met while training for a marathon, decided to take the personal styling service one step further when they started Front Door Fashion in 2013. ""For them, the problem was that they had closets filled with clothes, but nothing to wear,"" said Britt Ecker, the site's director of marketing. Their solution: a personal stylist who can send complete looks — clothing, jewelry and accessories — for occasions like date night, events or work. ""A stylist pulls up to 20 items from our warehouse,"" Ms. Ecker said, ""and meticulously styles them in four to six complete outfits, mixing and matching pieces to get the most out of each."" Detailed notes explain how to wear each look. The average amount is $500 a box, she said. The trial period is five days; a $100 deposit is applied to orders or refunded in full if everything is returned. The idea for the year-old Rockets of Awesome was born when Rachel Blumenthal became a mother. ""I was excited to shop for my son but quickly found it a chore to find stylish clothes that didn't cost a fortune,"" said Ms. Blumenthal, whose husband, Neil Blumenthal, is a founder of Warby Parker, a pioneer of ""trying before buying."" Her goal was to simplify the lives of parents by delivering a box of stylish, high-quality, moderately priced children's clothes produced by an in-house design team each season. The company analyzes both behavioral patterns (what shoppers are buying) and children's preferences (based on the profile parents create) to create a personalized box of 8 to 12 items, each ranging from $10 to $36; customers have 5 days to decide; and for those who care about such things, Gwyneth Paltrow is an investor. Vanessa Stofenmacher, a founder of Vrai & Oro, a direct-to-consumer jewelry start-up, is counting on the try-on business model to revolutionize engagement-ring shopping. ""If an engagement ring is a symbol of two lives joining together, we think the ring should be a joint decision,"" Ms. Stofenmacher said. ""The try-on feature allows her — or him — to select three designs and see the rings in person before committing, while still giving her partner the opportunity to choose the perfect diamond on his or her own."" Clients can test three sample rings for seven days in exchange for a fully refundable deposit of $50. What if you want to shop across websites? Ankush Sehgal is a founder and the chief executive of Try, which for $2.99 a month enables customers to try on items for seven days from any online retailers. ""In 10 years, we'll look back and laugh about how in the old days you had to pay upfront for online purchases,"" Mr. Sehgal said. ""The real reason why you have to pay upfront is because merchants can't trust consumers not to run away with the product. In today's world, we can solve this problem with technology."""
1,2017-07-05," Technology stocks had another scorching weeklong run last month, capped off by Amazon's startling decision to buy Whole Foods for $13.4 billion. And like many stock pickers these days, the portfolio managers at Parnassus Investments, a mutual fund company that invests mostly in large American companies, were at their wits' end as they gathered for the firm's weekly investment committee meeting. ""These stocks are hitting highs — again,"" said Todd C. Ahlsten, who oversees the firm's $15.6 billion core equity fund, pointing out that even low-risk exchange-traded funds were piling into the likes of Facebook, Apple, Google, Netflix and, yes, Amazon. The explosion in low-cost, index-tracking E.T.F.s and soaring technology stocks is generating existential angst among portfolio managers working in traditional mutual fund companies. Products of a culture where fame and fortune have accrued to those with the skills to pick stock market winners — foremost among them Warren E. Buffett and Peter Lynch at Fidelity — these brainy stock experts are now finding it harder than ever to fulfill their core function: investing in stocks that beat the broader market indexes. That is largely because a torrent of money has been pouring into machine-driven tracking funds, which allocate money to stocks like Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google's parent — the so-called Fang stocks — on the basis of how big they have become and where they rank in an index. For stock pickers, who pride themselves on their ability to zig where others zag by uncovering undervalued gems, such follow-the-crowd investing is anathema — and it is showing up in the numbers. According to S.&P. Dow Jones Indices, 88 percent of mutual funds that invest in large capitalization stocks trailed their benchmark over a five-year period ending last year. This period of underperformance has been most acute in the last 12 months, a period when the Fang stocks have outpaced the market by a large measure. Value-oriented investors who screen out companies that don't meet strict social standards, Mr. Ahlsten and his team have, over the last year, generated a respectable 14 percent return in their core equity fund where they have large stakes in Apple and Google. But the positions are not nearly enough to keep pace with the 18 percent return of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, within which six of the 10 top components are now technology stocks. Making matters even more stressful, Amazon, which they do not own, just agreed to buy Whole Foods — a deal that sent its stock even higher and could threaten a number of companies in the Parnassus portfolio. ""This is giving me a flashback to L.T.C.M. with all this correlation,"" said Benjamin E. Allen, Mr. Ahlsten's partner on the fund, recalling the lemminglike behavior of investors that led to the collapse of Long Term Capital Management in 1998. ""It is just mindless buying of these technology names."" Over the past year through May, $263 billion has exited actively managed mutual funds that invest in United States stocks while $308 billion has poured into E.T.F.s and index funds. Vanguard and BlackRock have vacuumed up just about all of this cash, according to Morningstar. This wave of money, combined with the slack performance of its old-style equity funds, prompted Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, to shake up his stock-picking ranks this spring. Funds were revamped, managers were let go and, in so doing, Mr. Fink questioned whether, in light of technological advances and the spread of information, stock experts could actually add value when it came to assessing widely followed companies in the S.&P. 500 index. More than $5 trillion remains invested in active-oriented funds according to FactSet, a data provider. It is still early to determine if Mr. Fink is describing a trend that will eventually reach its limits or whether a more fundamental, longer-term reordering of the stock-picking process will take place. The Parnassus portfolio managers are not alone in their fears. Of late, the argument has been made that the rise of machines and passive investing is distorting the broader market. And this week, Bank of America in a report called it the ""E.T.F.-ization"" of the S&P, warning that passive mutual fund assets in the United States have doubled to 37 percent today since 2009. For the moment, though, be it hedge funds that refuse to chase Amazon because it disdains showing profits, or value investors who blanch at the thought of buying Netflix at a price-to-earnings multiple of 360, the frustration is beginning to boil over. Compared with many of its peers, Parnassus has held up fairly well in terms of outflows. The company was founded in 1984 by Jerome L. Dodson on the notion that buying companies that respect the environment, cultivate harmony in the workplace and have sound governance policies would generate decent investment returns in addition to making investors feel virtuous. It has been a well-timed strategy, one that kicked into high gear after the financial crisis as investors embraced both the fund's philosophy and its performance. Assets under management shot up to $25 billion today from $1.8 billion at the end of 2008. Still, as technology stocks have skyrocketed, the returns of Parnassus' bellwether fund have lagged. Some 80 percent of the fund's peer group has done better over the past year. Over the longer term, however, the Parnassus results are better. For 10 years, the core equity fund handily beats its benchmark — 9 percent compared with 7 percent, a record that outpaces 98 percent of the competition. But at a time when investors are transferring cash from pricey mutual funds to lower-cost — and to date — better-performing exchange-traded funds, falling back on 10-year performance figures has become a less reliable defense. Through the first five months of the year, according to Morningstar data, the core equity fund has experienced outflows. They are small — $150 million out of a $15 billion fund — and they come after five consecutive years of inflows. Nevertheless, they have been enough to concentrate minds at Parnassus. ""It's stressful — we are competitive people,"" Mr. Allen said. ""I don't like calling my clients up every quarter and saying 'Sorry.'"" Embracing a deep-value style of investing, Parnassus is no momentum investor. And Mr. Allen, who was appointed president earlier this year and is expected to succeed Mr. Dodson in running the firm, has made it clear to fund holders that his ultimate aim is to outperform when stocks are tanking — as core equity did in 2008 — as opposed to running ahead of a bull market. So instead of chasing Amazon and Facebook, Mr. Allen and team have been betting big on health care stocks like Gilead Sciences. ""There is a herd mentality out there,"" he said. ""People are buying stocks irrespective of valuations — if we can't do the math, we are just not going to own it."" Parnassus has a quirky culture. Turnover is very low and just about all investment professionals start as summer interns, an approach that exposes potential hires to a three-month period of scrutiny. As per the orders of Mr. Dodson, men must wear ties — in the office and on the road — a sartorial demand that stands out in San Francisco's ultracasual workplace culture. To foster togetherness, at the end of each investment committee meeting, participants are asked to offer up a personal tidbit about how they spent their weekends. Deep-value stock pickers often exhibit idiosyncratic qualities, and that is true here. Mr. Allen, for example, keeps his desk virtually clutter-free, to encourage lean, disciplined thinking. And Mr. Ahlsten, to keep his own mind clear, limits himself to one hour of screen time (phone, computer or any other device) per day. Lately, it has been Amazon filling up their brains, and following the investment committee meeting, the two portfolio managers huddled in Mr. Ahlsten's office. At its current valuation, they agreed the stock was too expensive to buy. But the Whole Foods transaction poses a potential threat to at least five companies that Parnassus owns — from Sysco, the food distributor, to CVS, the pharmacy chain. All five have trailed the index over the past year, and the worry is that the Amazon deal could put further pressure on them. ""The threat to these companies has increased,"" Mr. Allen told his colleague. ""It reveals what Jeff Bezos' ambitions are, which are to disrupt and be part of everything. But the reality is that Amazon is not going to take over the entire world."" At least they hope not."

0,2017-07-10," Amazon's Prime Day — the annual, summer version of an all-Amazon Cyber Monday — starts today. As with the last few years, most deals aren't worth it, but there are a few gems sprinkled throughout. Subscribers to Amazon's Prime service (which gets you two-day shipping on items and other perks for $99 yearly) have access to thousands of items on sale. Even though only a small percentage of those deals are truly worth it, and few of them are available unless you're an Amazon Prime subscriber, you can make the most of Prime Day with careful planning. For example, Lightning Deals, sales that last for a just a short period of time or last only until stock runs out, can offer steeper discounts than the daylong deals. Similarly, if you're not an Amazon subscriber, consider signing up for the free trial to take advantage of the day's discounts — in case you see something you like. (Just make sure to cancel before you're automatically billed once the trial is over.) Amazon's competitors, like Walmart and Best Buy, might also offer discounts on select products as a counter to Prime Day, too. Check out The Wirecutter (which is owned by The New York Times) to help you map out a Prime Day strategy, which will update throughout Prime Day to feature the best discounts on things you may actually want to buy. We've also highlighted a few of our favorites so far: • Expect steep discounts on the Amazon Echo, a voice-controlled smart home speaker that can answer questions and play music to control all of your internet-connected devices. If you pick one up, The Wirecutter has a great rundown of all the things you can do with it. • Look for a deal on Tile's Slim Tiles, which, once stuck to the back of your phone, use Bluetooth to track your phone's location and alert you when it's getting too far from you. • The August Smart Lock, a keyless door lock for your home that uses your smartphone as the key, should also be available for much cheaper than the regular price.

0,2017-07-16," Charles W. Bachman, an engineer who created software to harness business data in the early 1960s, laying a technical foundation for modern digital commerce, died on Thursday at his home in Lexington, Mass. He was 92. His daughter Chandini Bachman confirmed his death. Mr. Bachman was a pioneer in the field of database management software. His work would later be eclipsed by that of other innovators, and software tools have changed drastically over the years. But behind every product search on Amazon, movie recommendation on Netflix or bid on eBay, there is a flood of digital communications mediated by database management software, which owes an intellectual debt to Mr. Bachman. He was working for General Electric when he developed a layer of software that allowed programmers to retrieve data for an automated manufacturing system that controlled a variety of tasks — production scheduling, parts ordering and inventory management. His Integrated Data Store software, first demonstrated in 1963, made it possible to share data across different applications. That capability had been talked about before, but Mr. Bachman was the first to carry it out. His software was crucial to converting the G.E. manufacturing-control system from an idea to a reality, an impressive technical feat given the limitations of the primitive computers at the time. In 1973, Mr. Bachman received the Turing Award from the Association for Computing Machinery for his contributions to database technology. The award is often described as the Nobel Prize for computer science. In 2014, Mr. Bachman visited the White House to receive a National Medal of Technology and Innovation from President Barack Obama. Mr. Bachman was the first Turing Award recipient who did not have a Ph.D. The earlier winners of the prize, which was first issued in 1966, had academic backgrounds, mainly as mathematicians or physicists. Mr. Bachman had degrees in mechanical engineering, a bachelor's from Michigan State College and a master's from the University of Pennsylvania. Mr. Bachman spent his career in the business world at a series of companies large and small, including Dow Chemical, G.E., Honeywell and a start-up backed by venture capital in the 1980s. Yet it was the application of computing to business problems — rather than business itself — that Mr. Bachman found appealing. ""He was always an engineer at heart,"" said Thomas Haigh, a technology historian at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee who interviewed Mr. Bachman for an oral history project and studied his work. ""He was motivated by the joy of tinkering with complex systems and making things work better."" Charles William Bachman III was born on Dec. 11, 1924, in Manhattan, Kan., the second of four children of Grace Marie Cary Bachman and Charles W. Bachman Jr. His father was the football coach at Kansas State College, and later at Michigan State. The younger Mr. Bachman grew to be a sturdy 6 feet 4 inches, and he inherited his father's fondness for sports, but his real passion was building and fixing things. ""I was always going to be an engineer,"" Mr. Bachman told Mr. Haigh in 2004. Mr. Bachman graduated early from high school, took spring and summer courses at Michigan State and then joined the Army in 1943, serving two years in the artillery corps in New Guinea, Australia and the Philippines. Antiaircraft guns at the time used simple mechanical computers to target a plane's predicted flight path, a rudimentary primer for Mr. Bachman's later work. After the war, Mr. Bachman returned to Michigan State to complete his undergraduate degree in 1948. The following year, he married Constance Hadley, shortly after she graduated from Michigan State. They were married for 62 years. She died in 2012. Besides his daughter Chandini, Mr. Bachman is survived by a brother, J. Cary; three other children, Thomas, Jonathan and Sara Bachman Ducey; five grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter. Mr. Bachman began his engineering career with big companies that were starting to use computers — Dow Chemical, G.E. and Honeywell, which bought G.E.'s computer business in 1970. During that time, Mr. Bachman took a leading role in computing organizations, which were establishing standards for how data is represented, shared and modeled. Later in his career, Mr. Bachman worked for smaller companies and started one of his own, Bachman Information Systems, in 1983. It focused on a technology called computer-aided software engineering that was intended to make creating software easier by offering programmers graphical tools instead of requiring them to write code line by line. His company attracted funding from two leading venture capital firms, Venrock and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and it enjoyed some early success. It sold shares in a public offering in 1991, and its stock price surged for a while. The young company had some impressive technology. But it failed to catch the shift to personal computers running Microsoft's Windows software and lower-cost applications programs. The remnants of Bachman Information Systems went through a couple of mergers and eventually sold to a larger corporation. ""Charlie was always the architect, not a managerial C.E.O. type,"" said Jonathan Bachman, a software project manager who worked with his father for years. ""And a lot of what he designed lives on, in a new guise, today."""
0,2017-07-18," At 9 p.m. Eastern time on July 10, Amazon initiated its annual show of force: Prime Day, a 30-hour exercise in the fullest possible expression of what Amazon can do. The sale, timed to the company's ''birthday,'' is marketed with an urgency bordering on panic. What's for sale? Basically anything. Where is it for sale? Wherever you are. Some sales last the whole prolonged day; others last a few minutes. A car seat. Golf clubs. Jeans and a screen door. Turmeric extract. A gallon of Elmer's glue. An Amazon product — the voice-controlled Echo, which can order more products from Amazon. Makeup brushes. Jumper cables. A tablet computer. The shopping experience is at turns euphoric and anxiety-inducing, Amazon's already-busy interface teeming with decontextualized blinking numbers: Sunglasses by ""Hulislem,"" $16.79, down from $115.95 after a previous discount to $28.99, 86 percent off, ends in 2:08:51, 63 percent already claimed. No? Next. Pro Series Waist Trimmer: $15.16-$18.96, 22 percent claimed, ends in . . . 0:00:43. Damn. Time is running out. As far as holidays go, Prime Day is contrived, crass and extremely effective (the company's ''biggest day ever,'' it says). This is not a venue for voting with your wallet or cultivating a consumer identity. It's about clicking a button that initiates a mysterious process carried out by teams of invisible laborers and automated proc­esses and results in a package at your door within two days. That package will contain one or more products that were probably built in a special economic zone in a faraway country; transported by ship, truck or perhaps one of Amazon's newly leased ''Prime Air'' planes; warehoused and waiting in one of the company's gargantuan and strategically placed fulfillment centers; sorted by subcontracted laborers, robots or both; and left at your door by whatever means necessary, be it U.P.S., FedEx, the United States Postal Service or a gig worker driving around in the family Accord. Prime Day is the opposite of precious; it is an awe-​inspiring project dedicated to moving product and making money. Amazon's yearly bonanza is a production that feels almost provocatively distant from the image cultivated by Whole Foods, which Amazon recently announced it would buy for a reported $13.4 billion. In 1996, years before Amazon turned a profit, the Whole Foods chief executive, John Mackey, was articulating a vision of his own. ''Whole Foods is a mission-driven business,'' he told The New York Times in August of that year, as yearly sales were on track for $850 million. ''We have other goals besides making money. If you are going to tap into deeper motivational energies, you need more than money."" Mackey's was perhaps the clearest articulation of a species of corporate messaging that emerged in the '90s and took hold in the 2000s: that of the reluctant captain of industry, the community-minded national chain and the compassionate employer. (Think Trader Joe's, the Container Store, Panera Bread, Starbucks or Jamba Juice.) It was accompanied by the rise of the conscientious — and typically affluent — consumer, for whom purchases could be not just ma­teri­ally but also morally aspirational. The food was ethically sourced, but crucially, the labor was, too. Lately this moment in the American service industry feels somewhat distant. It was a response to a different time: Retail and service jobs were on the rise, both in objective terms and in their share of the total work force. From 1989 to 1999, while the economy lost more than 1.4 million manufacturing jobs, it gained more than twice as many in retail alone. Back then, some said that with a few twists of the dial and a better-educated class of consumers, service work could be remade into something more careerlike, offering employees structure, predictability and dignity — and wealthier customers a form of absolution. It was, mainly, good marketing — triumphant liberal ideals expressed in the language of the heart. The economy of the late '90s was characterized by exuberant consumerism; companies like Whole Foods had devised a way to make people feel better about the products they were buying as well as the people they were interacting with. Whole Foods employees, customers were informed, earned a ''fair'' wage; they had a say in how stores were managed and in what products they stocked; they were voluntarily given benefits; they were not regarded as employees but as ''team members,'' working for their employer's profit while keeping an eye on the health and betterment of their communities. This was a heartening vision for the future of the service sector, at least in comparison to the prevailing stereotypes of the time — the burger-flipping teen, the seasonal retail employee — which were growing increasingly antiquated. It was also an opportunistic pose, a strategy, subject to constant and total revision. Mackey, a self-described libertarian, had an angle to his munificence: As he saw it, his employees' good fortunes were entirely dependent on his company, not government largess or regulations, and certainly not organized labor. (Mackey has compared unions to herpes: ''It doesn't kill you, but it's unpleasant and inconvenient, and it stops a lot of people from becoming your lover.'') After nearly a quarter-century of sustained growth, Whole Foods — a victim of overexpansion and a tired economy — entered a period of uncertainty that ended in its sale. Amazon's grand proclamations, on the other hand, tend to focus on domi­nation, not on providing any sort of abstract benefit to society outside the lowering of prices and the delivery of goods. The company has never put forth a rosy vision of the future of service labor. Amazon warehouse work is hard, often subcontracted and kept out of sight of consumers. According to a 2015 investigation by The Times, even at the corporate office, the work culture is unapologetically ruthless. Amazon's attitude toward labor is emblematic of the culture it grew out of — and an augur of the service economy that's on the rise today. Other tech companies, in particular platforms like Uber and TaskRabbit, have helped regular consumers grow comfortable with a software-mediated system wherein jobs are sliced into an endless series of assignments, with compensation negotiated wordlessly, instantly and without room for a second thought. Even Starbucks — once a champion of compassionate capitalism — recently began experimenting with pitiless automated scheduling software to assign shifts, before backing off after public outcry. Amazon's plans for Whole Foods are the subject of plenty of speculation. But one thing is certain: The Mackey marketing playbook — bringing labor to the fore in order to assure customers that they are A-O.K. and in good hands — has little to offer Amazon, which can and does regard labor as a simple commodity. In contrast to Whole Foods, which focuses in its marketing on fair-trade and locally sourced offerings, Amazon is made up of a dizzying array of supply chains that are effectively invisible: not hidden, just easily omitted from the consumer experience. I didn't lay eyes on a single Amazon employee during Prime Day, except for the home-shopping-marathon talent, leaving the onus on me to wonder what was going on behind the scenes. Aside from the ''origin scan'' on my track-your-shipment page, I won't know a thing about where my package came from, or be reminded of how it got to me. I will be told nothing about Hulislem. Amazon need not bother to tell a story; in fact, its goal is to reduce the retail story to a single button, an instant, an unprecedentedly complex process taken for granted. Mackey sought to build a more ethical company, and to herald a more ethical mode of consumption. He sought to take the politics out of labor and the labor out of politics. Amazon, by contrast, doesn't try to tell you yet another story about what it does and who it pays to do it. It bets — rightly, ruthlessly — that you'd be more comfortable with no story at all."
0,2017-07-20," In April, the activist hedge fund Jana Partners noisily declared itself an investor in Whole Foods Market and demanded that the grocery chain consider selling itself. Now, after Whole Foods announced a $13.4 billion deal to sell itself to Amazon, the investment firm is declaring victory — and selling its holdings. Jana disclosed in a regulatory filing on Wednesday that it sold off its roughly 8.2 percent stake in the grocery chain over the past month. The hedge fund began selling its holdings on June 19, but got rid of the bulk of its stake, 16 million shares, on Tuesday. All told, the firm sold its Whole Foods shares for an average price of about $42.87 — or roughly 39 percent more than the price before the activist investor revealed its stake. In selling all its holdings, Jana signaled that it did not expect anyone else to surpass Amazon's takeover bid of $42 a share in cash. Based on securities filings, Jana appeared to make a profit of roughly $305 million on its trade. That amounts to a healthy, and quick, return for Jana, an activist hedge fund founded by Barry Rosenstein in 2001. Jana has acquired stakes in a wide range of companies, like Tiffany & Co. and Bristol-Myers Squibb. When the investment firm began its campaign to shake up Whole Foods in April, the activist demanded four seats on the grocer's board, as well as other changes to the company's strategy. Jana's 8.2 percent stake made the hedge fund one of Whole Foods' biggest investors. But the firm's campaign did little to endear itself to Whole Foods' co-founder and chief executive, John Mackey, who  derided Jana as greedy investors out to make a quick profit."
1,2017-07-20," WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. — Meltdowns are not Matt Bomer's style, not even remotely, but he would have been due one in mid-March. It was late afternoon, and Mr. Bomer had been at work since 5 a.m. on the set of ""The Last Tycoon,"" the latest adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's unfinished novel about Old Hollywood. Mr. Bomer, as Monroe Stahr, a gifted young movie executive, had started the day with a difficult monologue about death and moved on to a hot-and-heavy love scene. A confrontational third scene, performed with Kelsey Grammer (as Stahr's thunderhead boss, Pat Brady), had left Mr. Bomer emotionally raw. Then I arrived to ask him jagged questions. For more than 90 years, Hollywood has been trying and failing to pull off the perfect Fitzgerald adaptation. Why couldn't anyone seem to get it right? What would keep this ""Last Tycoon,"" arriving on Amazon Prime on Friday, July 28, from becoming another sad example? ""Making a great television show is hard enough,"" Mr. Bomer said carefully. ""To also tackle F. Scott — whoa. But when you have brilliant people guiding you, people like Billy, you trust their vision and go for it."" That would be Billy Ray, the Oscar-nominated screenwriter (""Captain Phillips"") leading this nine-episode incarnation of ""The Last Tycoon,"" which Fitzgerald left unfinished upon his death in 1940. Mr. Ray, along with another writer-producer, Christopher Keyser, have envisioned a series of uncommon ambition. Forget Fitzgerald for a moment. Set in 1930s Hollywood, ""The Last Tycoon"" wants to be Amazon's version of ""Mad Men,"" a meticulous period drama that influences pop culture and mesmerizes Emmy voters. More than 40 ""Mad Men"" crew members — makeup artists, directors, dialect coaches, costume designers, set dressers — are now working on the new show. Adding a degree of difficulty, ""The Last Tycoon"" will serve as a vehicle for commentary about modern-day Hollywood and America as a whole. ""All these things that are coming to a head right now in our country — immigrants, sexism, the generational clash — are really big elements in our show,"" Mr. Bomer said. ""There are so many American ideals that Fitzgerald was wrestling with and that we're still struggling to perfect."" It all sounds fascinating. But cracking Fitzgerald would be a feat unto itself. ""No one has ever really managed to find the visual equivalent of Fitzgerald's writing,"" said Jeanine Basinger, the author of ""The Star Machine"" and the founder of Wesleyan University's film studies program. ""It always feels hollow. The soul is gone."" Of ""The Last Tycoon"" in particular, she added, ""It is awfully hard to film Hollywood — to make it look authentic."" Fitzgerald's work has served as the source for at least 20 movies and television shows, and it is hard to name one that truly sizzled. His short stories, in part because they are not as widely known, giving screenwriters more license to extrapolate, have been the least problematic. A PBS adaptation of ""Bernice Bobs Her Hair,"" about an introverted woman confronting the Jazz Age, drew praise in 1976 for Shelley Duvall's charming performance. ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,"" the 2008 film starring Brad Pitt as a man aging in reverse, was considered a feat in visual effects. But movies based on his books have mostly been considered crimes against literature (and sometimes retinas). When ""The Beautiful and Damned,"" a Manhattan morality tale, was adapted by Warner Bros. in 1922, Fitzgerald called it ""the worst movie I've ever seen in my life — cheap, vulgar, ill-constructed and shoddy."" ""Tender Is the Night"" lost its psychological underpinnings when 20th Century Fox turned Fitzgerald's complex tale of interlocking relationships into a vehicle for Jennifer Jones in 1962; the film's director, Henry King, never worked again. Of the various ""Great Gatsby"" films, the 1974 version starring Robert Redford is considered by many to be the most watchable, which is saying something. Reviewing that movie in The New York Times, Vincent Canby called it ""as lifeless as a body that's been too long at the bottom of a swimming pool."" Critics were (a bit) kinder to the most recent ""Great Gatsby,"" directed by Baz Luhrmann in 2013 and starring Leonardo DiCaprio. A. O. Scott, the co-chief movie critic for The Times, called it a ""splashy, trashy opera"" that was ""eminently enjoyable."" But Mr. Luhrmann's glossy approach horrified some purists. A. Scott Berg, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and Fitzgerald authority, assessed Mr. Luhrmann's film this way: ""Don't get me started on that."" Mr. Berg, whose books include ""Goldwyn: A Biography,"" about the movie mogul Samuel Goldwyn, is a consulting producer of Amazon's ""The Last Tycoon,"" and he vetted every script. Hollywood's challenges with Fitzgerald, he explained, start with his words. ""What makes his work so intoxicating is the writing — 'So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past,'"" Mr. Berg said, quoting the last line from ""The Great Gatsby."" ""But you can't film language. You can use narration, of course. But narration is usually something pasted on a film when the visual storytelling isn't working."" Rewrite too much, and Fitzgeraldophiles have a fit. But his novels are generally not structured for film. (""Tender Is the Night,"" for one, uses shifting perspectives and moves forward and backward in time.) So screenwriters have no choice. Novels heavier on plot — works by Charles Dickens, for example — lend themselves more easily to adaptation, Mr. Berg noted. ""Fitzgerald, on the other hand, fought metaphorically in his writing,"" he said. When Fitzgerald died, ""The Last Tycoon"" was half-finished, the incomplete story of two men, partners yet rivals, who keep a fictional film studio afloat as labor unions form and financing ebbs and flows. At the same time, the emotionally wounded younger executive, played by Mr. Bomer (""The Normal Heart""), struggles to move on after the death of his movie star wife. It was published only after the critic Edmund Wilson completed a version based on notes left behind. The best-known adaptation, directed by Elia Kazan and starring Robert De Niro, was a disaster in 1976. ""So enervated that it's like a vampire movie after the vampires have left,"" the critic Pauline Kael wrote at the time in The New Yorker. But the creative ensemble behind the new ""Last Tycoon"" saw the unfinished aspect of the book as an opening. ""Keep the icons from the novel — the Shiva head, the two-dimes-and-a-matchbox speech — but polish them up, move things around, explore characters in deeper ways,"" Mr. Berg said. ""There could be 50 episodes here if done correctly."" He added, ""What was put together as a book was extrapolated itself, so let's extrapolate from there."" ""The Last Tycoon"" is a roman à clef. Fitzgerald had returned to Los Angeles in 1937 to give screenwriting another stab. He had bills to pay after the commercial failure of ""Tender Is the Night,"" published in 1934. As he typed in an office on the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer lot, he began to hear tales of the interaction between Irving Thalberg, a next-generation film executive seen as a ""boy wonder"" for his ability to meld art and commerce, and the grandest of studio grand pooh-bahs, Louis B. Mayer. His observations became ""The Last Tycoon."" Joining the men at the forefront of the story is the plucky Celia (Lily Collins), whose father (Mr. Grammer) runs the studio. ""There is just so much going on with Celia — steadfast, tenacious, passionate, naïve but saucy,"" Ms. Collins told me between takes. ""I think fleshing Celia out was a little bit of how Billy and Chris solved the puzzle, and, you know, made this story into something that can last multiple seasons."" For his part, Mr. Ray said he was not overly worried about solving anything. Rather, he saw Fitzgerald's novel as a doorway — to period and setting (as exacting with 1930s Hollywood as ""Mad Men"" was with 1960s Manhattan) and the movie business, past and present. ""Who has power, what do they do to get it, what do they do when they've lost it?"" Mr. Ray said. ""What are the trades, compromises and deals that you'd make to get your movie made? No difference between 1936 and 2017. None."" Mr. Ray pointed to a plotline in the pilot, which has been available on Amazon since last summer, about how Mr. Bomer's character wants to make a movie but can't because the German government might find the story objectionable. In the 1930s, Germany was a huge box-office market. ""Those exact same conversations are being had about China right now all over Hollywood,"" Mr. Ray said. ""It's too big of a market to offend."" He added, ""This is a world — then, now — where creative impulses are systematically tempered if not squashed by the system."" He insisted, however, that the companies behind ""The Last Tycoon,"" which include Sony Pictures Television in addition to Amazon, had made requests that only improved his show. ""They were interested in the glamour and the romance, and they were right,"" Mr. Ray said. (Amazon executives do seem to have a fondness for the period — and Fitzgerald. In January, the streaming service unveiled the series ""Z: The Beginning of Everything,"" starring Christina Ricci as a fictionalized version of Fitzgerald's wife, Zelda.) Mr. Ray's point about the unchanging nature of the movie business came into sharp relief during my visit to ""The Last Tycoon"" set. The show had taken over Stage 4 on a compact West Hollywood lot known for hosting productions like ""Some Like It Hot"" (1959) and ""Fiddler on the Roof"" (1971). Over the decades, Charlie Chaplin, Howard Hughes, Frank Sinatra and Francis Ford Coppola used it as home base. Mr. Grammer took a rest on a bench outside the sound stage to chat with me. (""My character has a lot of self-knowledge, but he's also a bit of a brat,"" he said. ""All of a sudden, he's slamming into an emotion he didn't see coming."") Inside Stage 4, where the air smelled of paint and wood, Mr. Bomer was marveling over the meticulous production design by Patrizia von Brandenstein, who won an Oscar for ""Amadeus"" and put John Travolta in his white ""Saturday Night Fever"" suit. Indeed, there did not seem to be a matchstick out of place in the palatial, wood-paneled office belonging to Mr. Grammer's studio boss. A monumental carved mahogany desk sat on a platform at the end of the room. Flanked by torchères and ferns and dramatically decorated with an ormolu-mounted encrier, the desk — sitting in front of a stained-glass window — was more throne than anything. The same scene could well have unfolded in 1936. Filming soon resumed, with Mr. Bomer and Mr. Grammer performing that confrontational scene. Their fictional studio had fallen on hard times and borrowed money from a cutthroat competitor. Mr. Grammer's character wanted to pay back the loan by requiring all employees to take a 30 percent pay cut. And he wanted his popular production chief to break the news. ""You can't treat people this way and expect them to do good work!"" Mr. Bomer shouted. ""No,"" Mr. Grammer replied. ""But you can."" The director called cut. A swarm of crew members came out of hiding to fuss over various details. One woman adjusted Mr. Grammer's pocket square ever so slightly, and a man holding a rolled-up script gave a suggestion to Mr. Bomer. Perhaps add a touch more smoke to the air, someone suggested. (It filters the light in a pretty period way.) ""Let's try it again,"" the director said. After all, the pressure was on. This time, Fitzgerald was going to be done right."
0,2017-07-23," Lisa Angela Ingrassia and Christopher Ryan Slevin were married July 22 at Flying Horseshoe Ranch in Cle Elum, Wash. Lauren Capelle, the groom's sister, became a Universal Life minister to officiate. The bride, 35, and groom, 34, work at Amazon in Seattle. She is a marketing executive, and he is a senior content acquisition manager. The bride, who graduated cum laude from Georgetown, is the daughter of Vicki A.

0,2017-07-24," Travel is supposed to be about the journey. The goal isn't to get there first. Yet a variety of new services are aiming to speed things along, be it automatically checking you in for your flight, accompanying you through security, reserving a car or hotel with voice commands, or whisking you to the French countryside on new high-speed trains. Here's a look at half a dozen of the latest innovations. CHECKING IN FOR YOUR FLIGHT AirlineCheckins.com, an automatic check-in tool that was in beta last year, is officially up and running. AirlineCheckins.com is free and does just what the name suggests it does for flights on more than 100 airlines worldwide with automated check-in. It's handy for those who don't want to bother looking up their reservation number and going through the usual steps the day before a flight. When you register on the site — which includes filling out a profile with seating preferences, travel companions, frequent-flier program information and identification documents — you receive an AirlineCheckins.com personal email address. Thereafter, whenever you book a flight, you use that personal email address. This allows the site's agents to check you in as soon as the airline's online check-in window opens. If applicable, the site will also choose seats for you based on the preferences you selected. After that, your boarding pass is automatically sent to you via email or SMS message. The tool was created by the Lufthansa Innovation Hub, a subsidiary of the Lufthansa Group in Berlin, but can be used by any traveler on any airline that has online check-in capability. GLOBAL ENTRY ENROLLMENT ON ARRIVAL You've probably heard of Global Entry, the expedited security program from United States Customs and Border Protection. If so, you've probably also heard that wait times can be tedious at its enrollment centers. Customs and Border Protection is endeavoring to change that with ""Enrollment on Arrival,"" introduced this month at George Bush Intercontinental Airport, William P. Hobby Airport and Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, all in Texas; San Francisco International Airport; and Vancouver International Airport in British Columbia. With ""Enrollment on Arrival,"" if you've been conditionally approved for Global Entry, but still need to complete the in-person interview, you can do so during Customs primary inspection at the participating airport instead of at a Global Entry enrollment center. The program will be rolled out to more airports in the coming months. (The Global Entry application fee is $100 for a five-year membership; you must begin the enrollment process online.) AN ESCORT THROUGH THE AIRPORT A new tool, Solve, describes itself as an airport concierge service. Its goal is to save travelers time and alleviate confusion by providing someone to meet them at their arrival gate, expedite the immigration and Customs process, and then escort them to whatever car or shuttle is to take them to their hotel or home rental. The company sees itself as particularly useful for business travelers and young and elderly travelers. Solve is available in more than 480 airports globally, and the company says most of its employees speak both English and the local language. The cost starts around $225 a leg for two people. BOOK A HOTEL OR A CAR WITH YOUR VOICE If you've always wanted to be able to say ""Book me a hotel room in Las Vegas"" and suddenly find yourself with a reservation, you're in luck. Kayak just announced that users can now book hotel rooms with voice commands through Amazon's Alexa smart home devices. (Previously, you could search for hotels, flights and rental cars by speaking, but you couldn't book them that way.) Kayak performs the search for rooms while the booking is done through its sister brands, Booking.com and Priceline.com. This, as one might imagine, is not necessarily for obsessives who want to look at and compare dozens of hotel reviews, photos and lists of amenities. Early reviews suggest voice booking is best for the traveler who is looking to reserve a room at a familiar hotel, such as one he or she regularly stays in for business. Kayak is not the only travel company wading into voice-only booking. Next month, Avis will introduce voice-powered car reservation capability with Alexa, allowing users to issue commands such as ""I need a car at La Guardia Airport at 9 a.m. this Friday."" Customers will be able to make car rental reservations, review current or past reservations, and request electronic receipts of their last rental. As for booking your next flight, you still have to do that the old-fashioned way: online. UNLOCK YOUR HOTEL ROOM WITH A SMARTPHONE A few years ago, digital room keys were a novelty. Today, brands like Marriott and Hilton have made them available through their mobile apps at hundreds of hotels and are planning to make them even more widely available. Hilton, which offers digital keys at hotels throughout the United States and Canada, is now introducing them in Britain. This year Marriott is rolling out its mobile key to more than 500 hotels globally. The company has also expanded the capabilities of its mobile check-in/checkout feature. For the first time, users can request room upgrades and find out if they have been approved before they arrive. Additionally, they can skip the line at the front desk and request late checkout, which is guaranteed for Gold and Platinum Elite loyalty program members. WHIZ THROUGH THE FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE This summer, France began operating two new high-speed trains. Now you can get from Paris to Bordeaux in about two hours, and from Paris to Rennes in less than an hour and a half. Every day, some 35,000 high-speed seats will be offered between Paris and Bordeaux and 30,000 high-speed seats between Paris and Rennes. Look for interiors by the French designer Christian Lacroix on the Rennes route. For those who care about staying connected, some trains to Brittany will begin offering Wi-Fi later this year. The Bordeaux route trains will offer internet access."
0,2017-07-25," Your Roomba may be vacuuming up more than you think. High-end models of Roomba, iRobot's robotic vacuum, collect data as they clean, identifying the locations of your walls and furniture. This helps them avoid crashing into your couch, but it also creates a map of your home that iRobot could share with Amazon, Apple or Google. That prospect stirred some alarm when Reuters quoted iRobot's chief executive, Colin Angle, saying that a deal could come in the next two years. But iRobot disputed that account, saying in a statement on Tuesday: ""We have not formed any plans to sell data."" Reuters issued a correction, saying Mr. Angle was hoping to share the maps free with customer consent, not sell them. The confusion underscored that the frontier of smart home data and privacy can be a sensitive one. In the hands of a company like Amazon, Apple or Google, that data could fuel the growing product category of digital home assistants. ""When we think about 'what is supposed to happen' when I enter a room, everything depends on the room at a foundational level knowing what is in it,"" an iRobot spokesman said in a written response to questions. ""In order to 'do the right thing' when you say 'turn on the lights,' the room must know what lights it has to turn on. Same thing for music, TV, heat, blinds, the stove, coffee machines, fans, gaming consoles, smart picture frames or robot pets."" But the data, if shared, could also be a windfall for marketers, and the implications are easy to imagine. No armchair in your living room? You might see ads for armchairs next time you open Facebook. Did your Roomba detect signs of a baby? Advertisers might target you accordingly. Jamie Lee Williams, a staff lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, said information about the size of a home and the amount of furniture in it could allow advertisers to deduce the owner's income level. Eventually, it might even be possible to identify the brands the owner uses. ""Especially combined with other data, this is going to be able to reveal a ton of information about what people's lifestyles are like, what people's daily patterns are like,"" Ms. Williams said. Albert Gidari, director of privacy at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society, said that if iRobot did share the data, it would raise a variety of legal questions. What happens if a Roomba user consents to the data collection and later sells his or her home — especially furnished — and now the buyers of the data have a map of a home that belongs to someone who didn't consent, Mr. Gidari asked. How long is the data kept? If the house burns down, can the insurance company obtain the data and use it to identify possible causes? Can the police use it after a robbery? Some who reacted online on Monday and Tuesday were alarmed. ""Your friendly little Roomba could soon become a creepy little spy that sells maps of your house to advertisers,"" tweeted OpenMedia, a Canadian nonprofit. ""Just remember that the Roomba knows what room your child is in,"" Rhett Jones wrote in Gizmodo. ""It's the one where it bumps into all the toys on the floor."" In its written response, iRobot said that it was ""committed to the absolute privacy of our customer-related data."" Consumers can use a Roomba without connecting it to the internet, or ""opt out of sending map data to the cloud through a switch in the mobile app."" ""No data is sold to third parties,"" the statement added. ""No data will be shared with third parties without the informed consent of our customers."" ""Informed consent,"" of course, can be a vaguely defined term; Ms. Williams and Mr. Gidari noted that it might simply involve a privacy policy that few consumers read. But this criticism is ""really applicable across the board to everybody's privacy policy,"" Mr. Gidari said. ""It's really tough to criticize one without criticizing all."" Mr. Gidari added that in today's technological climate, iRobot's plans were unsurprising. ""It kind of goes with the mantra that everything that can be connected will be connected,"" he said, and a corollary ""is that all the data that can be collected will be collected."" But in the long term, what iRobot does with individual users' data may not be the most important question. The third-party collection and dissemination of information about the inside of homes could have implications for the privacy laws that constrain the government and law enforcement. The Supreme Court has held that Americans have ""a reasonable expectation of privacy in your home,"" Mr. Gidari said. ""Once your home is turned inside out, does that reasonable expectation of privacy dissipate?"""
0,2017-07-26," SYDNEY, Australia — Think you know the ins and outs of Australian English? Amazon is hiring. ""Amazon is seeking a linguist with an Australian background to join our data team,"" reads a job description on its website. The job will involve transcribing, as well as annotating speech and language data, and it is one of several openings for linguists, including those familiar with Canadian French, American English and Canadian English. Though the job posting didn't get into such specifics, it's very likely to involve research for Amazon's voice-recognition device, the Amazon Echo, which helps users check the weather, stream music and plan to-do lists through a personal assistant named Alexa. The inability of some software to recognize accents is a well-documented frustration among people who speak English with a non-American accent. A BBC Scotland comedy bit from 2010 involving two Scottish men trapped in a voice-activated elevator has received over a million views. (""Please remain calm,"" the operator intones as the men begin screaming in frustration.) The effort by the Seattle-based Amazon to hire more linguists with backgrounds outside American English may point to an acknowledgment that such systems must adapt to all types of voices if they are to appeal to multiple markets. ""If people like Google, Apple and Amazon are putting money into this stuff, localization needs to be a part of it,"" said Simon Musgrave, a lecturer at Monash University in Melbourne. Current voice-recognition software, he explained, draws from a training database of sounds and uses statistical modeling to match audio with the understanding of vowels, consonants and words. ""They're going to need a body of recordings from Australians with good annotations"" that connect audio to meaning, Mr. Musgrave said. The Australian accent, for example, is distinct from American English in that it is non-rhotic — the ""r"" sound is not pronounced unless followed by a vowel sound. Australian English also has a lot of diphthongs and triphthongs — ""multiple vowels within the same space,"" said Howard Manns, a lecturer in linguistics at Monash University. ""And that might be difficult for a computer or voice recognition to make sense of,"" Mr. Manns said. The software is getting better. In May, Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google, announced that the company's voice-recognition software had a word error rate of less than 5 percent, an improvement on the 23 percent error rate it had in 2013. Jobs that tie linguistics and technology are becoming more common. For example, Appen, a company based in Australia that collects data for machine learning for technology companies, employs more than 70 linguists and has thousands of other linguists that it can consult. Linguists annotate recordings of people speaking, down to the pauses in their voices, which are then fed into an algorithm that connects the audio with the meaning, said Phil Hall, the senior vice president of Appen's language resources. As for the Amazon listing, it's an attractive prospect for any linguist wanting to work on a cutting-edge project. ""I'm going to apply for that job right now,"" Mr. Manns joked."

1,2017-07-28," Amazon and its founder, Jeff Bezos, are having a moment. In the last week, the company and Mr. Bezos have reached some impressive milestones. Amazon's stock market capitalization vaulted above $500 billion on Wednesday. And for several hours the next day, the company's soaring share price propelled Mr. Bezos into first place in the rankings of the world's richest people. Once merely an online bookseller, Amazon now appears to be laying claim to the entire retail universe — and beyond. It is a formidable force in such disparate fields as cloud computing, movies, music, food, artificial intelligence and the distribution of washing machines and toasters. Mr. Bezos, who is also Amazon's chief executive, has gone even further afield with ventures as varied as newspaper publishing and rocket launching, and he says he intends to use his immense wealth to reinvent philanthropy. The company and its founder have taken dominant positions in so many areas that they defy categorization. Yet noteworthy as these real-world achievements are, they may understate Amazon's importance. Despite an earnings report on Thursday evening that disappointed the market and led to a 2.5 percent decline in its share price, Amazon is remarkable as a purely financial entity. Its stature as one of the most successful companies in the history of the stock market is already assured. In fact, the numbers show that since 1997, when it became a publicly traded company, Amazon has evolved into one of the century's greatest wealth-generating machines. ""Amazon now belongs in a very small group of stocks,"" said Hendrik Bessembinder, a finance professor at Arizona State University. ""It's one of the greatest wealth creators since 1926, and it's reached that status in a very short period of time."" When I first spoke with Professor Bessembinder in May, he had prepared a list of the 30 greatest wealth creators in the stock market through 2015. But this past week, he showed me a Lifetime Wealth Creation list, with fresh rankings through 2016. The stocks at the very top remained the same: Exxon Mobil, followed by Apple, General Electric, Microsoft and IBM. But further down the list, Amazon appears for the first time. It is ranked 14th, just behind such august names as Berkshire Hathaway and Procter & Gamble and ahead of Coca-Cola and DuPont. In essence, the list shows which stocks have been the most profitable for shareholders over history. A very small group — 4 percent of all publicly traded stocks — account for all of the stock market's net gains from 1926 through 2016, he found. And only 30 stocks — Amazon is now one of them — account for more than 30 percent of all of the market's wealth creation in that 90-year period. What's more, Professor Bessembinder found that Amazon's annualized return through 2016 was 37.4 percent, the highest of all the top 30 wealth creators. That is partly because Amazon hasn't existed for that long: It's easier to sustain fast growth for shorter periods. Exxon, for example, which has created more than $1 trillion in wealth for shareholders since 1926, more than any other company, ground out its gains at a slower pace: It has an annualized return of only 11.9 percent, Professor Bessembinder said. Even after the earnings blip on Thursday, Amazon's value in the market has skyrocketed this year. It has risen more than 36 percent. ""If it holds onto those gains, we can expect that it will climb higher on the cumulative wealth creation list,"" he said. Of course, while Amazon's market power has been wonderful for its own investors, it has damaged many of its competitors — diminishing the wealth of shareholders of those companies. Consider how Amazon's cumulative stock returns dwarf those of its retail competitors and the overall market. Using Thomson Reuters data, I calculated that over the last 15 years through Tuesday, Amazon returned more than 8,200 percent, compared with 125 percent for Walmart, 2.2 percent for Sears, and 302 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, dividends included. If you had invested $1,000 in Amazon in July 2002 — and had held onto your shares — that money would be worth $83,000 today. By comparison, $1,000 invested in the entire Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, with dividends, would amount to $4,100 — not a bad performance, until you look at the gaudy Amazon returns. Far worse, if you had put the money in Walmart shares, your investment would be worth only $2,250. And if you had stuck with Sears during all of its travails, you would be almost where you started, with $1,022. Those figures aren't adjusted for inflation, however, so the Sears return is more miserable than it looks. The Bureau of Labor Statistics calculator shows that $1,022 is worth only $751 in 2002 dollars. Ouch. (To be fair, the $83,000 in current Amazon cash is about $61,000 in 2002 dollars. But that's still an eye-popping sum.) Bespoke Investment Group, a stock market research firm, has another way of comparing Amazon's stock returns with those of its retail competitors. It has built the Death by Amazon Index, which it describes as ""a way to track the performance of the companies most affected by the rise of Amazon.com."" Those companies — there are now 54 of them — include Barnes & Noble, Costco, Best Buy, GameStop, Macy's, Nordstrom, Sears, Target, CVS Caremark and Rite Aid and Walmart. The numbers are stark. The Death by Amazon Index has declined 18.9 percent through Monday — trailing Amazon by almost 55 percentage points. No Amazon investor has as much money in the company, or has benefited as much from the stock's rise, as Mr. Bezos. He owned 16.7 percent of the company in May 2017, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. His stake is worth more than $80 billion, according to Bloomberg, accounting for the bulk of his personal wealth. His stake in Blue Origin, the spaceflight firm, is worth another $3 billion, Bloomberg said. His net worth hovers around $90 billion, placing him neck and neck with Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft. Unlike Mr. Gates, who has diversified his portfolio and has been giving money to charity at a rapid pace, Mr. Bezos continues to bet heavily on Amazon. As Thursday's earnings report showed, that does entail risk. The company's ever-expanding retail operations are sapping its profits, but it has been raking in earnings through cloud computing. As has been the case since Amazon's inception, it pays no dividends, instead plowing cash back into the company's core. For now, the mighty Amazon wealth-creation machine continues to roar. Whatever happens next, this is already one of the great tales in the history of capitalism."
2,2017-07-28," SEATTLE — Investors gave Amazon's stock a bump early Thursday in anticipation of a strong earnings report later in the day, briefly making Jeff Bezos, the company's chief executive, the world's wealthiest person. By day's end, Mr. Bezos had not returned the favor, with Amazon reporting profits that were less than a third of what Wall Street had expected. No matter. It was still the kind of performance that investors have come to expect from Mr. Bezos and Amazon: a 25 percent increase in sales and example after example of how the company is pouring money into original video programming, warehouses and shaping the future with new technology and products like its Echo family of gadgets. The company's stock fell only about 3 percent in after-hours trading. The relative indifference to Amazon's bottom line was another sign of why the company is so frightening to competitors and critics. Investors would almost certainly have pummeled any other retailer that turned in the kind of performance that Amazon reported Thursday. Instead, they give Amazon several miles of leash because of its history of turning investments into sales growth and technology leadership. ""Yes, we are continuing to invest and stepping up investments,"" Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, said in a conference call with reporters, repeating a variation on a theme that company executives have expressed many times before. Concerns about Amazon's mighty ambitions are on the rise at the moment, in part because of its pending plan to acquire Whole Foods for $13.4 billion, a deal that could put Amazon on a path to becoming a significant player in the vast grocery market. Although the deal has faced criticism from Democratic lawmakers, labor unions and consumer groups, there is no sign that it is in real jeopardy. Amazon's shares have risen more than 8 percent since the deal was announced in June, helping to propel Mr. Bezos to the position of world's second-wealthiest person, according to a ranking compiled by Forbes. According to a filing with securities regulators in April, Mr. Bezos holds nearly 81 million Amazon shares — almost 17 percent of the company. Forbes's estimate of Mr. Bezos's wealth also includes the value of his other investments — including his ownership of The Washington Post and the rocket company Blue Origin — and cash from the sale of securities. For a short time on Thursday, Forbes estimated Mr. Bezos's wealth at $90.6 billion, compared with $90 billion for Bill Gates, a philanthropist and a co-founder of Microsoft, moving Mr. Bezos to the No. 1 spot for the first time. By the end of the day, Mr. Bezos had dropped back to No. 2. For the second quarter, ending June 30, Amazon said its net income was $197 million, or 40 cents a share, compared with net income of $857 million, or $1.78 a share, in the same period a year earlier. Analysts had expected a decline in profits, but not one that big. The average earnings estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters was $1.42 a share. Mr. Olsavsky said the company's operating income, a different measure of profits, was within the range of possibilities it had previously shared with investors. Mr. Olsavsky did not play down the fact that Amazon had found ways to invest in the growth of its business. The company's revenue increased 25 percent, to $38 billion from $30.4 billion a year ago. That made analysts happy. Their average revenue estimate was $37.2 billion. Since the Whole Foods deal was announced, several members of Congress have raised concerns about its potential impact, expressing fears that it could accelerate consolidation in the food industry, eliminate jobs at brick-and-mortar retailers and further limit the availability of grocery stores in already underserved areas. There has been much debate about how many jobs have been lost at physical stores amid the growth of Amazon specifically and online shopping generally, but Amazon is a jobs engine at the moment. It said it had hired 30,000 new employees in the second quarter, and it plans to hold job fairs next week at 10 of its warehouses as part of an effort to fill 50,000 open positions. Michael Keeley, an antitrust lawyer at the firm Axinn Veltrop & Harkrider in Washington who has represented corporate clients in the grocery business, said he did not foresee serious challenges threatening the Whole Foods deal, despite President Trump recently suggesting in a message on Twitter that Mr. Bezos uses The Post as a tool to discourage political scrutiny of Amazon. ""I would be very surprised if this deal had really substantive problems with the F.T.C.,"" Mr. Keeley said, referring to the Federal Trade Commission."
3,2017-07-28," Thursday was something of an up-and-down day for Jeff Bezos. For a brief few hours, Mr. Bezos — the chief executive of Amazon, the owner of The Washington Post, the man behind the rocket company Blue Origin and, lately, a frequent target of President Trump — became the richest man in the world, writes Nick Wingfield, a technology reporter for The New York Times. According to a real-time list of billionaires compiled by Forbes.com, an early pop in Amazon's shares on Thursday pushed Mr. Bezos' wealth ahead of that of Bill Gates, a Microsoft founder-turned-philanthropist. A few hours later, with tech stocks dipping, Mr. Bezos had receded to No. 2 in the wealth ranks. And that quite likely will not change again immediately: On Thursday afternoon Amazon unveiled its quarterly earnings results, reporting a steep fall in profits and a rise in spending. The company's stock declined in after-hours trading. Of course, being only the second-richest person in the world is not exactly the worst place to be for Mr. Bezos. That he is even in that position is a testament to how he has built Amazon into a company thoroughly ingrained  in people's lives. These days, Amazon not only is a prime online shopping destination. It also influences our entertainment choices, provides cloud computing services to numerous companies whose services we use, and has transformed the way goods are delivered to us. And Amazon is only likely to embed itself further into our lives in the future, as it invests in new technologies (drones, anyone?) that are set to be deployed in coming years."

""Yet attention to detail doesn't buy passion,"" Neil Genzlinger wrote in The Times. And while the show and the people in it look great, ""caring about any of them doesn't come easily."" THE RICH AND THE RUTHLESS on Urban Movie Channel. Victoria Rowell, who from 1990 through 2007 played Drucilla on ""The Young and the Restless,"" created this fictional soap-within-a-soap about the first black daytime drama, booted off the soundstage after 20 years for a talk show. Richard Brooks plays Augustus Barringer, the self-made showrunner willing to do anything to keep his spot on the air, whether filming out of his Hollywood mansion or moving his company to Jamaica. Ms. Rowell is his mercurial wife, Kitty Barringer, fresh out of rehab and intent on clawing her way back to the top of divadom as her character — wait for it — Blue Sylla. LAURIE AND HARDY on BritBox. As in Hugh Laurie and Tom Hardy, packaged together in this six-show collection. On Mr. Hardy's side: ""The Take,"" about an ex-con eager to use his prison connections to ascend the rungs of the underworld; ""Gideon's Daughter,"" in which a public relations guru reconsiders his priorities; and ""Oliver Twist,"" the Dickens classic. On Mr. Laurie's: sketch comedy in ""Alfresco"" and ""A Bit of Fry and Laurie,"" as well as the Rowan Atkinson lark ""Blackadder."""
0,2017-07-31," Amazon's rapidly expanding influence on a wide portion of the American public has become impossible to ignore — and it is giving rise to a whole new side of the advertising industry. As more people live large portions of their lives in Amazon's ecosystem, ad agencies are increasingly offering specialized services to help brands take full advantage of the company's universe. That means adding flourishes like recipes and magazine-style images to product pages, coming up with creative ways to get customers to post reviews on Amazon and plotting how companies can best connect with people who are using devices like the voice-activated Echo. And Amazon itself, aware of its growing power, is encouraging companies to buy more ads through its own media group. Its argument: When an ad is on Amazon, a direct connection can be made between people seeing it and then making a purchase. ""How your product is perceived on Amazon and in the Amazon community in ratings and reviews has such a powerful impact on the future of you as a brand,"" said John Denny, vice president for digital and e-commerce at Bai Brands, the beverage company. ""Increasingly, if you win on Amazon, you win, period. And this is the world marketers have to wrap their brains around."" Several advertising executives anticipate that more agencies will begin offering Amazon-focused services, comparing the company's rise to previous paradigm shifts like when search engines and social media became a daily part of people's lives. It's already affecting what shoppers see. Take, for example, the Amazon product page for a whey protein powder from Optimum Nutrition. It was put together with help from the Tombras Group, based in Knoxville, Tenn., which recently started an Amazon-focused division. Dooley Tombras, the firm's executive vice president, said it sent products to influential Amazon reviewers in hopes of soliciting positive feedback and conducted ""guerrilla sampling,"" like holding events ""where we're handing out a product and we've got teams there with iPads and we're encouraging people to write reviews of a product on the spot."" There are more than 14,000 reviews of the powder. The page also has more than a dozen images of the powder taken from ""multiple angles"" against a light background to look clean and professional, Mr. Tombras said, along with short videos extolling the powder. Brands can pay Amazon to customize the middle of pages with large advertorial images and information — which in the protein powder's case included photos of men working out; a recipe for ""birthday cake pancakes"" made with the chocolate-flavored whey; and a chart featuring six of its other products, like Micronized Creatine Powder, explaining when and how they should be consumed. Mr. Tombras's firm is even working on a feature for Echo devices that will provide recipes from Optimum Nutrition. ""If you find a recipe you like and happen to not have that flavor or item, you can go ahead and make that purchase,"" he said, ""which is pretty cool."" Amazon has long been an online shopping behemoth, but marketers now know it is playing an increasingly important role in how people discover and learn about their goods. ""E-commerce is nothing new, it's been going on for decades, and Amazon is nothing new, it's been successful for decades — but now they are becoming much more of a dominant force in brand discovery,"" said Sarah Hofstetter, the chief executive of the digital agency 360i. Its quick success in categories like apparel and the popularity of voice search emphasized that, Ms. Hofstetter said. ""Amazon is the new shelf space,"" she added, ""and if you're not on it, you may be rendered invisible."" Mindshare and Possible, two agencies under the ad giant WPP, recently announced a service to help companies spend their advertising dollars across ""the Amazon ecosystem."" (Possible caught the industry's attention this year when it acquired Marketplace Ignition, an Amazon-focused consulting firm.) The agencies said in the release that more than half of United States consumers now started online product searches on Amazon, compared with 28 percent on search engines and 16 percent on retailer websites. Martin Sorrell, WPP's chief executive, said on an earnings call this year that ""Amazon's penetration in most areas is frightening to some."" He added that the company was his response when people asked him, ""What worries you when you get up at night and when you wake up in the morning?"" In an interview in Cannes, France, last month, Mr. Sorrell said his firm wanted to do more with clients and Amazon, but noted there were major questions around how brands might gain access its customer data and compete on voice search. ""What happens if I say to Alexa, 'I like Cheerios,' and Alexa says, 'I've got Kellogg's Corn Flakes, which are 10 percent off'?"" he said. Amazon Media Group, the company's growing advertising division, has been looking to assuage such concerns while touting new ways marketers can reach people on Amazon. Seth Dallaire, its head of global ad sales and marketing, has been urging agencies to view product pages and images as ""brand marketing vehicles,"" noting that if they are not well maintained it could undermine all the work companies did to get people there in the first place. ""We can see the entire customer-decision journey, and that's what's unique,"" Mr. Dallaire said. ""We can help a brand if they're selling their products on Amazon understand when a customer is exposed to an ad and, when they clicked on an ad, if they bought something, and then we can help them tailor their marketing messages and their creative to each different step."" That's no small pitch given the guesswork that goes into advertising. Amazon has long sold lucrative sponsored product listings and other ads tied to search terms on its site, like Google. It also offers automatically placed ads on external sites using its own technology and data, and marketing on Amazon packages and devices like Kindles. It can harness its users, too — while Amazon does not sell cars, it worked with Hyundai last year to offer test drives to Prime Now customers in California. Amazon does not disclose the size of its ad business, though estimates show it is well below Google and Facebook, which each bring in more than $25 billion from ads annually. While eMarketer estimated that Amazon will attract more than $1 billion in ad revenue this year, BMO Capital Markets forecasts $3.5 billion for 2017 and $5.7 billion next year. ""In the grand scheme of things, the advertising revenue they're generating is small compared to Google — you can barely compare them,"" said Norm Johnston, global chief strategy and digital officer for Mindshare. ""But for Amazon, it's not the advertising revenue in itself. They know if brands invest in the platform, the more sales they're going to generate, and a lot of those sales lead to subscription models."" In the past, many brands handled their Amazon business through store sales teams that determined shelf positioning and end-of-aisle displays at brick-and-mortar chains. That is no longer workable as Amazon extends its ad network, offering branding opportunities through its Prime program and streaming N.F.L. games. ""In the old world, you'd run magazines, TV spots and outdoor ads, then you'd go into the shop, and they'd control what happened in the shop,"" Mr. Johnston said. ""You can't distinguish like that anymore."" To that end, marketers are also learning to pay new attention to issues like how much of an item is in stock before promoting it, or risk being penalized by Amazon's algorithms if they aren't able to handle demand, Mr. Denny of Bai said. Mr. Dallaire said Amazon planned to keep investing in its ad sales and agency development teams. Ultimately, he said, the interest is generated by behavioral shifts. ""It could be people shopping on their phones, the expectation you or I might have of getting immediate customer-review information and pricing information within seconds of pulling a device out of our pockets, it could be the expectation of hearing a song you ask Alexa to play,"" he said. ""Advertisers want to make sure they are not missing out on these customer trends."""
0,2017-08-01," LONDON — Gal Gadot, DC Comics and the whole Justice League gang are not the only big winners from ""Wonder Woman,"" the film franchise that has already taken in more than $780 million globally; it just seems to keep on giving (and is already gearing up for a sequel). The latest beneficiaries of the movie's halo effect: Whitaker Malem, the London leather designers behind the super heroine's metallic leather armor as well as the armor for her fellow Amazons. They're this season's breakout British brand. ""Wonder Woman is our calling card at the moment,"" said Keir Malem, 52, sitting with his partner, Paddy Whitaker, also 52, in the loft-like ground floor of their two-story home and atelier in Dalston, East London. Dotted around the walls are mementos from their travels mixed in with seminal artworks from the 20th-century Italian maestro Lucio Fontana and a 1970s 3D spotted torso by the British pop artist Allen Jones. The two men, who uncannily look and dress alike, had just returned from a five-month stint making more leather armor on location in Australia for Wonder Woman's sister movie, ""Aquaman,"" scheduled for release in December 2018. Just upstairs from where they were sitting was the atelier where the Wonder Woman armor, commissioned by Lindy Hemming, the film's costume designer, was born. The two work at side-by-side desks, and pictures adorn the main wall, including a close-up of the Wonder Woman costume made before it was metallicized. Torsos fitted with leather corsets litter the room, while hidden at the back is a vintage 1950s Singer sewing machine, bought at North London's Chapel Market for 60 pounds in 1988. On it, Mr. Malem said, ""everything is done, even though it wasn't made for sewing leather."" Called ""beyond cool"" by New York magazine, Wonder Woman's armor has become a breakout star in its own right. ""We were allowed to go close to the body and do sexy armor, which is unusual, as a lot of armor is massive,"" Mr. Malem said. Rihanna's stylist, Mel Ottenberg, asked to borrow a moss-green shearling corset for the kickoff of the star's jewelry collaboration with Chopard at this year's Cannes Film Festival. The veteran costume designer Sandy Powell, known for films like ""Shakespeare in Love"" and the coming ""Mary Poppins Returns,"" asked Whitaker Malem to design armor for her latest film, ""The Favourite."" (They couldn't do it because of Aquaman. ""We were gutted,"" Mr. Malem said.) And the arty French Double magazine featured Joan Severance, the model and actress, wearing one of their molded black bustier collaborations with Allen Jones in its current spring/summer issue. ""We'd never been in that magazine before,"" Mr. Malem said. Now ""we're exposed to a whole new audience."" Even Donatella Versace riffed on the Wonder Woman look in her recent couture collection, with a corseted catsuit glittering with nearly 8,000 sequins and a gold leather minidress. Though best known today for their film work, which has included Luke Evans's red leather jacket in this year's ""Beauty and the Beast,"" as well as the 2008 ""Dark Knight"" bat suit, Whitaker Malem began life as a fashion house in 1988, focusing on leather. The designers had met by chance at a house party in London two years earlier; Mr. Whitaker was studying fashion design at Central Saint Martins and Mr. Malem was acting at the Tricycle Theater in Kilburn, northwest London, after dropping out of a hairdressing course at the London College of Fashion. After two runway collections and after dressing such names as Paula Abdul and Cher in leather, however, the two were still struggling to make ends meet, and moved into collaborating with other fashion designers. They made a gold leather dress for Alexander McQueen's spring/summer 1997 Givenchy collection, and a leather eagle bustier for Tommy Hilfiger's spring/summer 2000 Red Label. ""Our biggest fashion mistake was that Isabella Blow asked our P.R. to be given one of our dresses and we wouldn't let her have it,"" said Mr. Whitaker, referring to the late famed British stylist and pointing to a photograph of the gold chain mail dress with a gold molded ivy leaf leather bustier in one of their scrapbooks. ""Maybe, had we given it to her, things might have been different."" Still, it was a learning experience that helped them embrace their newfound Wonder Woman fame. Mr. Malem and Mr. Whitaker are now focusing on personal fine art work, funded by their movie fees, which largely involves male and female bodies fashioned in leather and spliced together to create a wall sculpture. ""We hope that the people who think this Wonder Woman stuff is cool are going to want to have it on their walls when we sell it,"" said Mr. Whitaker, pointing out the superhero overtones of an idealized hermaphroditic body. The pieces were first shown at a fine leatherwork exhibition curated by a British leather goods veteran, Bill Amberg, during May's London Craft Week just as ""Wonder Woman's"" publicity machine was cranking up. This fall a solo show titled ""Leather Unbound,"" part retrospective, part new work (part, yes, ""Wonder Woman"") will open at the Gallery Liverpool. There are plans to take it to Moscow and Los Angeles later ""We're going to show the Wonder Woman Barbie dolls because they are so accurate, but not in their boxes,"" Mr. Whitaker said. Instead, he said, the plan is to show them under acrylic ""in a cool, slightly ironic way to celebrate the pop art side of things."" Photographs of the leather working process will also be on display, including illustrations of how the costume was gilded with gold, silver, copper and aluminum leaf. As to whether he was worried Wonder Woman's appeal might be over by the late autumn, Mr. Whitaker shook his head. ""The Wonder Woman Blu-ray and DVD comes out for Christmas,"" he said."
1,2017-08-01," Joining a recent boon in alt-history dramas, Amazon is developing a series called ""Black America"" that imagines what would happen if freed African-Americans after the Civil War formed their own nation from three Southern states as reparations for slavery. The show invited immediate comparisons to ""Confederate,"" a coming HBO drama that also imagines a modern world in which the American South seceded and slavery remains legal. That project — from the creators of ""Game of Thrones,"" David Benioff and D.B. Weiss — has drawn criticism and a social media backlash, with fears that a depiction of modern-day slavery would be exploitative and racially insensitive. The Amazon show is the project of Will Packer, a producer whose films include ""Girls Trip,"" and ""Straight Outta Compton."" He announced details in an interview with Deadline on Tuesday. Amazon and Will Packer Media confirmed that the series was under development, saying that Mr. Packer will team up with Aaron McGruder, who created ""The Boondocks"" and ""Black Jesus."" Though Deadline reported that the flap over ""Confederate"" prompted the ""Black America"" team to reveal its premise, the project has been in the works for about a year. Both series will land in an America that seems as racially divided as ever, where symbols of the Confederacy are still the subject of headlines. But the Amazon series takes a different tack, setting aside the ""What if the South had won?"" trope. In the back story of ""Black America,"" the Confederacy was defeated. But instead of enduring the painful eras of Reconstruction and Jim Crow, African-Americans received reparations. The former slaves and freedmen claimed Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, a nation known as New Colonia. That nation has a ""tumultuous and sometimes violent relationship"" with the United States, which is described as both an ally and a foe. The series picks up in the current day, when New Colonia and the United States have enjoyed two decades of peace, but the new nation is growing rapidly while the old one declines. ""It was something that was personally intriguing for me as a black American,"" Mr. Packer told Deadline. ""You would be hard pressed to find many black Americans who have not thought about the concept of reparation, what would happen if reparations were actually given. As a content creator, the fact that that is something that has been discussed thoroughly throughout various demographics of people in this country but yet never been explored to my knowledge in any real way in long-form content, I thought it was a tremendous opportunity to delve into the story, to do it right."" On Twitter, Mr. Packer reiterated that the show was not in response to ""Confederate."" But he addressed HBO's show in his Deadline interview, saying ""the fact that there is the contemplation of contemporary slavery makes it something that I would not be a part of producing nor consuming."" He added, ""Slavery is far too real and far too painful, and we still see the manifestations of it today as a country for me to ever view that as a form of entertainment."" ""Black America"" will be Amazon's second high-profile foray into alternative history. In 2015, ""The Man in the High Castle"" imagined a 1960s in which the allies lost World War II, with Nazi Germany and Japan splitting up the United States. That series, loosely based on the Philip K. Dick novel, also drew some controversy at first, after an advertising campaign that included decorating New York subway trains with Nazi symbolism."
2,2017-08-01," SHANGHAI — Days after Apple yanked anti-censorship tools off its app store in China, another major American technology company is moving to implement the country's tough restrictions on online content. A Chinese company that operates Amazon's cloud-computing and online services business there said on Tuesday that it told local customers to cease using any software that would allow Chinese to circumvent the country's extensive system of internet blocks. The company, called Beijing Sinnet Technology and operator of the American company's Amazon Web Services operations in China, sent one round of emails to customers on Friday and another on Monday. ""If users don't comply with the guidance, the offered services and their websites can be shut down,"" said a woman surnamed Wang who answered a Sinnet service hotline. ""We the operators also check routinely if any of our users use these softwares or store illegal content."" Ms. Wang said the letter was sent according to recent guidance from China's Ministry of Public Security and the country's telecom regulator. Amazon did not respond to emails and phone calls requesting comment. The emails are the latest sign of a widening push by China's government to block access to software that gets over the Great Firewall — the nickname for the sophisticated internet filters that China uses to stop its people from gaining access to Facebook, Google and Twitter, as well as foreign news media outlets. The move came at roughly the same time that Apple said it took down a number of apps from its China app store that help users vault the Great Firewall. Those apps helped users connect to the rest of the internet world using technology called virtual private networks, or VPNs. Taken together, the recent moves by Apple and Amazon show how Beijing is increasingly forcing America's biggest tech companies to play by Chinese rules if they want to maintain access to the market. The push comes even as the number of foreign American tech companies able to operate and compete in China has dwindled. Beijing has become increasingly emboldened in pushing America's internet giants to follow its local internet laws, which forbid unregistered censorship-evasion software. Analysts say the government has been more aggressive in pressuring companies to make concessions following the passage of a new cybersecurity law, which went into effect June 1, and ahead of a sensitive Communist Party conclave set for late autumn. The government has been intent on tightening controls domestically as well. It recently shut down a number of Chinese-run VPNs. New rules posted to government websites in recent days said Communist Party members can be punished for viewing illegal sites and that they must register all foreign or local social media accounts. Also in response to the new law, Apple said it planned to open a new data center in China and store user data there. Ms. Wang, who said that Sinnet handles Amazon Web Services operations across China, said that the company has sent letters warning users about such services in the past but that the government had been more focused on other issues. Amazon Web Services allows companies small and large to lease computing power instead of running their websites or other online services through their own hardware and software. Because Amazon's cloud services allow customers to lease servers in China, it could be used to give Chinese internet users access to various types of software that would help them get around the Great Firewall. Keeping in line with censorship rules is only a part of it. In cloud computing, China requires foreign companies have a local partner and restricts them from owning a controlling stake in any cloud company. New proposed laws, which have drawn complaints of protectionism from American politicians, further restrict the companies from using their own brand and call for them to terminate and report any behavior that violates China's laws. While Microsoft and Amazon both run cloud services in China, similar ones run by local Chinese internet rivals dwarf them in scale. In particular Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba runs its own cloud services, which have grown rapidly in China. In order to operate in the country, China's biggest internet companies must stay in close contact with the government and carry out Beijing's various demands, whether they be a request for user data or to censor various topics. While China is not a major market for Amazon, the company has been in the country for a long time and has been pushing its cloud computing services there. Also recently the company announced a partnership with the state-run telecom China Mobile to create a Kindle, the company's e-reader device, aimed at the local Chinese market."

1,2017-08-02," ROMEOVILLE, Ill. — Brandon Williams arrived at an Amazon fulfillment center here, about an hour outside of Chicago, around 7:30 a.m. on Wednesday, one of thousands across the country who turned up for the company's first Jobs Day. While he appeared to wilt slightly during the five hours he waited before an M.C. summoned him for a tour, his enthusiasm did not wane. ""What's not great about a company that keeps building?"" he said, seated in a huge tent the company erected in the parking lot as a kind of makeshift waiting room. The event was a vivid illustration of the ascendance of Amazon, the online retail company that, to a far greater extent than others in the tech industry, has a seemingly insatiable need for human labor to fuel its explosive growth. Like other tech giants, Amazon is recruiting thousands of people with engineering and business degrees for high-paying jobs. But the vast majority of Amazon's hiring is for what the company calls its ""fulfillment network"" — the armies of people who pick and pack orders in warehouses and unload and drive delivery trucks, and who take home considerably smaller incomes. The event on Wednesday, held at a dozen locations including Romeoville, Ill., was intended to help fill 50,000 of those lower-paying positions, 40,000 of them full-time jobs. Those high-low distinctions did not seem to bother the attendees of the jobs fair, many of them united in the conviction that Amazon represented untapped opportunity — that a foot in the door could lead to a career of better-compensated, more satisfying work, whether in fulfillment, I.T., marketing or even fashion. Mr. Williams, a military veteran studying computer network security at a nearby community college, said he hoped to eventually work his way up to an I.T. job with Amazon. But even those whose ambitions were more in line with the vast majority of available jobs could not hide their excitement. Victor Salgado, who makes $9 per hour with no benefits doing maintenance at an aerosol company and spent three years before that grouting floors, said he was attracted by the promise of an upgrade in pay and benefits. He said he would be willing to ""do anything"" at Amazon. ""A record-breaking 20,000 applications were received on this day alone,"" said John Olsen, an Amazon human resources vice president, ""with thousands of job offers extended to candidates and more to come in the next few days."" Filling so many jobs is challenging, which partly explains the jamboree at Amazon's warehouses on Wednesday. The company's warehouse jobs, which typically pay $12 to $15 an hour, have a reputation as physically demanding and repetitive, with high rates of burnout. Amazon has successfully resisted union organizing that might introduce more worker protections. Amazon has said its wages and benefits are attractive. Five years ago, it introduced a program called Career Choice that pays tuition costs for employees seeking training to join higher-paid professions, like airline mechanics, medical lab workers and computer-aided design technicians. Jack Chasteen, who recently finished high school and is still living at home, said he had been planning to seek a job as a pizza deliveryman but that his parents urged him to turn up at Jobs Day instead. ""They said it would be a good building block for stuff in the future,"" he said, citing Amazon's tuition assistance program, which he hoped might help him pursue a nursing degree. It is indisputable that the growth of e-commerce, which Amazon captures a big chunk of, has devastated many physical retailers, leading to store closures and layoffs. There is debate, though, about how much the corresponding expansion of jobs related to e-commerce has offset the decline in employment at physical stores. Amazon's remarkable head count growth stands in sharp contrast to its image as a job killer. It was the fastest American company in history to employ 300,000 people globally, crossing that threshold last year, its 20th as a public company, according to a paper published this year by the Progressive Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank. Walmart reached that milestone 21 years after it went public, the paper said. Amazon now has more than 382,000 employees globally. In January, it vowed to create 100,000 jobs over the next 18 months in the United States. It increased its domestic work force from 30,000 employees in 2011 to over 180,000 at the end of 2016. The figures do not include the thousands of seasonal workers that join the company to help it with the crush of holiday shopping. Some come in R.V.s as part of a group Amazon called CamperForce. The company pays for their campsites. Amazon hired 30,000 new employees in its last quarter alone. Facebook, in contrast, employed just under 21,000 people at the end of June, while Alphabet, the parent company of Google, employed about 76,000. Arun Sundararajan, a professor of information, operations and management sciences at New York University's Stern School of Business, said Amazon's employment needs are unique among tech companies. ""Their business has always been a meld of the digital and physical,"" he said. ""Retail is very different from digital products or music or social networking. The other tech platforms are, at their core, selling tech products."" But there are questions about how long Amazon's fulfillment jobs will exist, as robots and other forms of automation become more capable at doing the jobs that now require humans. Amazon is more aggressively using robots to help make the operations inside its warehouses more efficient. For now, the company said machines are not replacing people. Instead, they mostly move large shelves of merchandise to stations where orders are manually picked. Many academic researchers and start-ups are working on robots that have the dexterity to pick orders automatically. Amazon sponsors a competition to encourage engineers to build more advanced warehouse robots. When those technologies are perfected, the employment picture inside Amazon's warehouses could look very different. That day could be a decade or more away, though. ""While the digital disruption is destroying the traditional retail business model,"" Dr. Sundararajan said, ""the Amazon model that replaces it will continue to live in the physical world and require human labor for the foreseeable future."" As for Mr. Williams, he later sent a text message to say that he was not hired on the spot on Wednesday, a possibility that Amazon had dangled before workers. On the plus side: he was told there was still a chance to get a job at the center through a temporary staffing company."
0,2017-08-06," When Jeff Bezos, then a New York hedge fund employee, decided to start Amazon in 1994, he quickly moved to the West Coast. So did Mark Zuckerberg, who moved from Harvard to California in 2004 to find the technology talent and financing needed to build up Facebook. Today, the West Coast exerts a similar tidal pull for start-up companies in finance. Nine of the 15 United States financial technology ""unicorns"" — companies worth $1 billion or more, as tracked by CB Insights — are in the San Francisco area. These Bay Area companies, which are not public, include the online payments processor Stripe, the online lender Social Finance and the finance website Credit Karma. For the last seven years, a New York business-backed program — the FinTech Innovation Lab — has been working to stem that West Coast tide by helping financial services start-ups sell their services in New York in an industry where the city clearly dominates: big banks and other finance companies. The program's backers include Henry Kravis, a co-chief executive of the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts; Fred Wilson, a co-founder of the venture capital firm Union Square Ventures; and James D. Robinson III, a former chief executive of American Express. ""There's no reason New York should not be the fintech capital of the world,"" said another program backer, the internet entrepreneur Kevin Ryan. He is a former chief executive of the online advertising pioneer DoubleClick and a founder of the flash-sale platform Gilt Groupe and the business news website Business Insider. The term ""fintech"" covers a group of start-ups, often funded by venture capital investors, that aim to apply new technology in areas like online lending, investing and payments. These start-ups have surged in popularity among investors as banks have had to focus on complying with regulations and rebuilding capital. The FinTech Innovation Lab is a so-called accelerator that annually gives a half-dozen start-ups the chance to interact with top financial firms, hone their products and learn how they can fit into what Accenture, a management consultant, estimated was a $270 billion technology budget for banks worldwide. Tim Estes, the president of Digital Reasoning in Nashville, which uses artificial intelligence to spot compliance and reputational risks for banks in routine employee emails, said that going through the lab program in 2012 was ""transformative for the company, opening up doors across Wall Street as advertised."" As Digital Reasoning won business from Wall Street, it opened a New York office near Union Square, which now has about 30 employees and is the firm's second-largest office. Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse Group have become investors. Mr. Estes said Goldman was an early customer, two years after the investment bank's chief executive was attacked in televised congressional hearings over a subprime debt sale that one Goldman staff member had described in an email as a bad deal. As firms like Goldman realized other such ""time bombs"" might be in their email files, ""everyone wanted a better bomb detector,"" Mr. Estes said. Another start-up that won business through the lab, in 2012, was True Office, which turns compliance training into a game experience for employees. Adam Sodowick, the chief executive of True Office, had first met Maria Gotsch, a lab co-founder, at a dinner event at a Flatiron district loft. Morgan Stanley signed as a client and invested in True Office, which eventually moved its headquarters from Boston to New York and was acquired in 2014 by the New York Stock Exchange. The exchange resold it this year. The best-known firm to go through the program, in 2015, was the blockchain start-up Digital Asset, shortly after it recruited Blythe Masters, a former JPMorgan Chase derivatives pioneer, as its chief executive. Accenture soon invested in the company, which aims to improve Wall Street trade processing. The New York lab is one of hundreds of incubators and accelerators that have sprung up throughout the country to help start-ups, such as Y Combinator in Mountain View, Calif; Techstars in Boulder, Colo.; and Plug and Play Tech Center in Sunnyvale, Calif. Though many programs require start-ups to give them an equity stake of 5 percent or more, the New York lab gets only 0.5 percent. The lab began in 2010 as a way to bolster the New York City economy after the 2008 financial crisis. It is co-sponsored by Accenture and the Partnership Fund for New York City, an arm of the nonprofit Partnership for New York City — a business-backed civic group formed in 1979 by David Rockefeller. The lab is designed for companies that want to become partners with big financial institutions, rather than compete with them. One goal, said Mr. Robinson, an investor at RRE Ventures since 1994, is to ""expose the big banks and insurers to early-stage companies doing interesting things in this area."" Jean Donnelly, the executive director of the Boston accelerator FinTech Sandbox, said, ""New York has come up pretty quickly as No. 2"" behind Silicon Valley in fintech venture investments. Accenture says data from CB Insights indicates that Silicon Valley's lead in fintech debt and equity financing has narrowed. In 2012, the gap was 4.5 to 1, as valley fintechs raised $1 billion against $225 million for New York fintechs. In 2016, the gap was just 1.1 to 1, with $2.65 billion for Silicon Valley and $2.41 billion for New York. Some West Coast venture investors acknowledged the city's progress. The gap between Silicon Valley and New York has narrowed, said Pat Grady, a partner who focuses on fintech at Sequoia Capital in Menlo Park, Calif. But he added: ""If you want to build the next Apple or Airbnb, you come to Silicon Valley. The unmatched talent, risk-taking culture and relentless optimism mean that you have a better chance of outsized success here than anywhere else in the world."" New York can be fertile ground for ""business to business"" start-ups selling to banks, Mr. Grady said. But some of the largest United States fintechs, like Social Finance and Credit Karma, cater directly to consumers and have potentially larger markets, he said. So how does the FinTech Innovation Lab work? Every year, the staff and a sponsor committee choose 20 to 25 start-ups from more than 100 applicants to meet with about 35 banks and other sponsoring institutions. The sponsors, in turn, collectively choose six to eight winners for the three-month program. Banks that once had to be ""browbeaten"" to participate in the lab are now waiting in line to check out the start-ups, said Matt Harris, a partner in Bain Capital Ventures. Lately, out-of-town banks like KeyBank in Cleveland and U.S. Bank in Minneapolis have joined. Companies selected to participate this year included Cutting Edge, Nova Credit and BehavioSec. Cutting Edge, a cybersecurity firm, helps protect customers' locations and identities on the internet. Nova Credit processes and provides credit data from foreign institutions on individuals so banks can lend more readily to immigrants. BehavioSec helps confirm customer identities by analyzing how they type, click and swipe on their devices. The lab featured 19 events over three months, including meetings with Mr. Kravis and James Gorman, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley. Mr. Kravis stressed the importance of company culture, and Mr. Gorman fielded questions about Wall Street's use of artificial intelligence and how investment banks do business with start-ups. There was also a practice pitch session at the office of the private equity firm Warburg Pincus. This year's lab culminated with a Demo Day on June 22 at a packed 215-seat auditorium at Bank of America's New York office. Each entrepreneur was introduced by a Wall Street mentor and then gave a brief pitch for his business. Mr. Robinson and other venture investors strolled a hall with exhibit tables for each start-up. David Reilly, a senior technology executive at Bank of America, said the program was useful because big banks ""can be exceptionally difficult to sell to."" Still, none of the three New York fintechs that raised the most financing in 2016 were alumni of the FinTech Innovation Lab, according to the Accenture data. In one of last year's largest New York financings, Oscar Health Insurance, the lone New York fintech unicorn on the CB Insights list, raised $400 million. Oscar was co-founded by Joshua Kushner, the younger brother of President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and backed by the younger Mr. Kushner's Thrive Capital. Other New York fintechs that raised the most money in 2016 included the online student lender CommonBond, which raised $612.5 million, and Payoneer, a global payments platform, which raised $180 million."
0,2017-08-09," Seeso, NBC's streaming comedy subscription service, is folding later this year. The service started in January 2016 as a niche alternative to Hulu, Amazon and Netflix, but struggled to maintain a steady subscriber base. Seeso cost $3.99 a month and offered next-day streaming of NBC's flagship programs, such as ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon."" The service also created original programming including ""The UCB Show,"" starring Amy Poehler; ""HarmonQuest,"" a show from the ""Community"" and ""Rick and Morty"" creator Dan Harmon; and ""The Cyanide & Happiness Show,"" an animated adaptation of the popular web comic. But Evan Shapiro, who helped start the service as executive vice president of NBCUniversal Digital Enterprises, departed in May, and the service suffered a round of layoffs in June. In a Facebook post on Wednesday, Seeso announced its closing and said that some of its original content would move to VRV, a separate streaming service. The service's newest series, ""There's … Johnny!,"" which dramatizes the behind-the-scenes action of ""The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson,"" has been postponed from its scheduled debut this month."
0,2017-08-10," All film lovers, amateur and professional, no matter how well-versed, have gaps in their movie knowledge. For me, one category in which I lack, and which nags at me the most, is Bollywood. I excuse myself by remembering that South Asian cinema is a gigantic entity, particularly when taking into account movies produced outside of Mumbai, which looms as large to that genre as Los Angeles does to ""Hollywood."" There's no shortage of streaming services touting films in Hindi, but to give myself a brief refresher course in contemporary Bollywood, I initially checked out what the kids call a trusted brand — Amazon Video. In March the company began the channel Heera, which is available to Amazon Prime members for $4.99 a month. Its offerings are extensive: ""Heera Bollywood Movies,"" ""Heera Telugu Movies,"" ""Heera Tamil Movies,"" ""Heera Marathi Movies,"" ""Heera Bengali Movies."" The site also offers series, including ""Inside Edge,"" an Amazon original about a cricket team that's quite a bit more explicit in terms of content than most Bollywood movies — the first episode features a player having sex and taking drugs simultaneously in the workout room while a match is in progress. (While Heera itself is only available in the United States and Britain, Amazon offers the series worldwide on Prime.) Declining to give an exact number, an Amazon Video publicist told me that the site offers ""several hundred movies and TV episodes."" One salient feature of Bollywood fare is that individual movies encompass a wide variety of genres; this elasticity is part of how Bollywood film language is radically different from the West's. ""Badrinath Ki Dulhania,"" directed by Shashank Khaitan and starring Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt, is a recent romantic comedy/musical/melodrama that begins with a lengthy text disclaimer about the illegality of dowries (dowries being a salient feature of the film's action). The story concerns arranged marriages in a provincial region, but its lead characters, a handsome knucklehead and an independent-minded woman, are sufficiently stock to register as ""universal."" It's all fun and games until the woman runs off to Singapore to train for a job as a flight attendant. All the families are scandalized to the extent that one patriarchal figure vows to track her down and ""hang her body in the streets so it's a lesson that women shouldn't go past their limits."" Everything works out in the end. Regardless of the gravity of some of its situations, the movie maintains a consistent cheery glossiness and is lit in the manner of a particularly lifestyle-opulent hip-hop music video (like the Notorious B.I.G.'s ""Hypnotize""). The leads are attractive, the music infectious (in its Auto-Tuned way) and the big dance numbers big. I prefer action movies, and Heera has the very frenetic 2012 spy thriller ""Ek Tha Tiger"" and the engaging 2004 buddy-cops-versus-motorcycle-gangs ""Dhoom,"" which climaxes with an elaborate robbery intercut with a musical dance number in which the participants sing ""Fiesta Latina, it's driving wild/Come salsa with me now, it's party time."" This movie came in its original language, Hindi, with no subtitles, but if you're a non-Hindi speaker who understands the dynamics of buddy-cop movies, it's not too hard to follow. (Amazon Video told me: ""We provide English subtitles where available and are working hard to ensure all Heera titles include them."") I recommend you go to Amazon's preferences and customize the subtitling to your tastes before using the channel; the default preset I had on through my PlayStation 4 yielded a small yellow box with black lettering that was a challenge to read on movies that did have subtitles. It looks as if Amazon's own Fire TV offers the easiest way to customize subtitles. As much as the channel offers, it's not a one-stop shop. I had a list of movies I wanted to check out, or check out again, and they were not on Heera. They are available on Amazon Video, but in à la carte rent/buy options. These included the elaborate — and some would say eccentric even by Bollywood standards — 1992 period epic ""Khuda Gawah"" and the potentially overpowering 2013 Tamil action picture ""Singam II,"" which can each be rented for $3.99 and purchased for $19.99.  One genre in which PBS has long distinguished itself is documentary, and the long-running series ""POV"" has its own site, which is also available as an app on Apple TV, Roku and other devices. Starting Aug. 14, the POV and PBS sites will be streaming the 2003 documentary ""Two Towns of Jasper"" free, for 30 days. Directed by Whitney Dow and Marco Williams, the movie looks at the white and black communities of Jasper, Tex., in the aftermath of the murder of James Byrd Jr., who was African-American, by three white men in 1998. Byrd was chained and dragged for three miles from the back of a pickup truck after being brutally beaten. The movie depicts a mostly stoic black population, while the whites are shown as vaguely annoyed that their town is the subject of national attention. Several of them are heard using the phrase ""I don't agree with how [Byrd] died,"" an interesting sentiment to parse. They complain that people have become overly sensitive to a particular racial epithet. One radio D.J. grouses: ""If I have to hear the word 'healing' one more time,"" and trails into mumbles rather than saying what he's likely to do. A town council is shown trying to suspend Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a school holiday, while continuing to give kids the day off when the rodeo comes to town. One young man expresses his regard for the Confederate flag: ""The rebel flag to me, a lot of young white boys, means just that: Reb."" ""Two Towns of Jasper"" is painful to watch — nearly two decades after the crime, not much seems to have changed."
0,2017-08-11," THE GREAT PASSAGE By Shion Miura Translated by Juliet Winters Carpenter 212 pp. Amazon Crossing, paper, $10.99. Translating a novel is a bold act: a willingness, despite all the ways we can misunderstand one another, to string a bridge of words from author to reader and trust that meaning will somehow make it across. Translating a Japanese novel is particularly bold, since the cultural chasm between Japanese author and American reader is unusually deep. But translating a Japanese novel about lexicography — a story in which language itself is a character — is boldness of an entirely different order. Miura's book owes some of its charm to the skill of her translator, the veteran Juliet Winters Carpenter. Like the chefs in the film ""Jiro Dreams of Sushi,"" the characters in ""The Great Passage"" devote every waking breath to a project as detailed as it is abstract: the production of a new and ""really human"" dictionary, comprehensive and yet modern, ""a ship that crosses the sea of words."" Mitsuya Majime, an endearingly disheveled and stork-thin word nerd, is the editor at the center of this endeavor, his very surname a homophone in Japanese for ""seriousness of purpose."" When recruited to the project by the high priests of a publisher's dictionary department, he wins their trust when he describes the beauty of commuters riding an escalator: a chaotic swarm arranging itself magically into parallel lines ""whisked neatly upward"" like the sprawl of words made systematic in the pages of a dictionary. Neither Majime's life nor those of his motley crew possess the same degree of orderliness. They shuffle index cards and turn pages until their fingertips are worn smooth, they spend years in search of the perfect paper on which to print their masterpiece, and they debate the definition of ""ren'ai"" (romantic attachment) even as they struggle to navigate the turbulence of their own personal entanglements. Mastery of words may not result in masterly communication, and a great dictionary, like a love story, is ""the result of people puzzling over their choices"" — a classic tension that has made ""The Great Passage"" a prizewinner in Japan, as well as both a successful feature film and an animated television series. THE NAKANO THRIFT SHOP By Hiromi Kawakami Translated by Allison Markin Powell 229 pp. Europa Editions, paper, $16. Kawakami's latest translated work is less a novel than a series of hyper-real pictures at an exhibition, bursts of closely observed detail leaving out much of the why and wherefore that link one to the next. In a suburb of Tokyo, the unpredictable and faintly lecherous Mr. Nakano runs a shop selling secondhand goods, from T-shirts and air-conditioners to vintage Glico plastic toys from the 1930s. Two young people have drifted into his employment: the novel's narrator, Hitomi, both a free spirit and a self-conscious perseverator, and Takeo, a gruff boy with an artistic bent. Also present is Mr. Nakano's bohemian sister, Masayo, who looks on benevolently as Hitomi and Takeo circle each other, mutually attracted but struggling to connect. These lives and others intersect at the thrift shop, their pasts mostly unmentioned, their futures unplanned. Incidents occur, as randomly assorted as the merchandise: a freak stabbing, a visit to a yakuza mobster with a suit of samurai armor to sell, the death of an Afghan hound, the appearance of a celadon bowl that may or may not be cursed. Awkward date nights end in anticlimax: ""We had sex, briefly."" Kawakami lavishes attention on quotidian minutiae and exquisitely awkward pauses, ending scenes on maddeningly unresolved but vibrant images. The result is a queasy myopia of uncomfortably intimate moments and blurry context. It feels a lot like daily life in Tokyo, but odder. Students of Japanese culture refer to ""mono no aware,"" a wistful sense of the impermanence of things. Kawakami's characters, surrounded by discarded objects, update this ephemeral ""Tale of Genji"" ambivalence to the broken present. ""People buy things exactly because they're of no use,"" Mr. Nakano tells Hitomi. ""The Nakano Thrift Shop"" may lack the standard features of a novel — back story, narrative momentum, character development — but it captures an untranslatable Japanese mood. BEASTS HEAD FOR HOME By Kobo Abe Translated by Richard F. Calichman 191 pp. Columbia University, $25. On the fourth page of this 60-year-old novel — now available in English — Abe's teenage protagonist, an orphan named Kyuzo, breaks bread with four Russian soldiers in a Manchurian city not long after Japan's defeat in World War II. The fare is plain and the situation fraught as Kyuzo waits anxiously for his chance to flee the city of his birth and begin a journey toward a homeland he has never seen. Even in the moment of departure, though, he recognizes the preciousness of the ""thick, solid walls"" he is leaving behind; for years he will remember the cheese and sausages, the soup boiling on the stove, ""as his last meal that was humane and satisfying."" What follows is an extended and grisly nightmare of cold, hunger, pain, isolation and fear. Japan's surrender stranded millions of Japanese citizens abroad in a political wilderness, erasing the colonial past and offering nothing in its place; as Abe puts it, ""yesterday and tomorrow were no longer linked together."" As the border between friend and enemy shifts constantly, the beasts of the title are both literal and figurative — and as Kyuzo descends farther into desperation and terror they are increasingly inside his own mind. Survival is an act of unimaginable improvisation, with rational thought ceding to ""fear, phantoms and a beastlike visceral impulse."" In one memorable scene, when Kyuzo confronts a feral dog neither of these starving creatures is sure who is the prey. With its historical setting and named characters, ""Beasts Head for Home"" diverges from the surreal landscape of Abe's best-known work, ""The Woman in the Dunes,"" but alienation is at the Kafkaesque heart of both novels. Though Kyuzo somehow manages to complete his physical journey, he remains an exile, unable even to define the home he seeks. ""Perhaps Japan doesn't exist anywhere,"" he says. ""With every step I take, the wasteland walks together with me."" The howling misery of his displacement circa 1947 resonates powerfully with the headlines of 2017: a grim story of the past for our grim present."
1,2017-08-11," This is the story of two piles of rubble. One, constructed on a soundstage in Bethpage, N.Y., was the setting for a giant pit, home to an ancient, evil force that will eventually unite the Marvel heroes of ""The Defenders,"" in a new Netflix series being released on Friday, Aug. 18. The other, built on the streets of Brooklyn near McCarren Park, was a scene of destruction resulting from a climactic confrontation between a nefarious villain and the costumed champions of ""The Tick,"" an Amazon series making its debut on Aug. 25. Both of these shows, adapted from comic books, represent the fruition of yearslong efforts to bring them to the screen, and are the beneficiaries of a seemingly insatiable appetite for superhero stories — in movies, on network and cable television and on streaming services. But beneath the similarities, the two shows possess very different ambitions. ""The Defenders,"" which brings together the main characters of four previous Netflix series in a single super team, is trying to inject some levity into a Marvel formula that has become increasingly serious and overly familiar. ""This show is a bit more lighthearted,"" said Charlie Cox, the star of ""Daredevil."" ""When these guys come together, there is obviously a lot of fun. But at the same time, we want to maintain high stakes that are necessary to keep driving the story."" Meanwhile, ""The Tick"" is fundamentally a satire, one that pokes fun at the conventions of comic-book narratives and the many media spinoffs they've spawned. But in its latest incarnation, ""The Tick"" — which is coming to TV for the third time — is also trying to see how much of the gravity in modern comic-book adaptations it can incorporate without losing its sense of humor. ""To do a superhero comedy now and make it worth its salt, it had to matter to itself,"" said Ben Edlund, the creator of ""The Tick."" ""That's what we're doing,"" he added. ""We're aggressively mattering to ourselves, and I recommend it."" Mirroring the strategy that Marvel used for its ""Avengers"" movie franchise, ""The Defenders"" draws from the previous Netflix shows ""Daredevil"" (starring Mr. Cox), ""Jessica Jones"" (starring Krysten Ritter), ""Luke Cage"" (starring Mike Colter) and ""Iron Fist"" (starring Finn Jones). All set in a version of New York where its characters cross paths, do battle and (occasionally) have sex with each other, these shows have been rolled out at a breakneck pace since Marvel and Netflix announced them in 2013. Each has its own creative team and varying narrative tones: For example, ""Daredevil,"" now approaching its third season, is a neo-noir about a blind lawyer turned costumed vigilante; while ""Jessica Jones,"" heading into its second season, has offered a rugged redemption story about a private investigator haunted by past trauma. ""Bringing these characters together into one world is going to require a dramatic shift from all of their individual shows,"" Mr. Cox said. ""That has made this show feel very different."" Around the no-frills set of ""The Defenders"" in early March, its actors teased and toyed with one another; like their characters, they have bonded from their past encounters and the ad hoc circumstances of this reunion. Crammed together in a small production office adjoining their set, Ms. Ritter and Mr. Colter spent a shooting break bantering about each other's dietary habits. ""Mike always has some commentary on whatever we're eating,"" Ms. Ritter said. ""'Oh, you're going to eat a banana? That's how you get belly fat.'"" Right on cue, Mr. Colter replied, ""Split one with a pal if you're going to have one."" That good-natured mockery is a welcome respite from a relentless work schedule. Mr. Jones, still damp with sweat from a fight scene he'd just shot, described how in 2016 he finished shooting ""Iron Fist"" and, within hours, was onstage at New York Comic Con to introduce ""The Defenders."" ""We started filming at 5 p.m. and didn't finish until 10 a.m. the next day,"" he said. ""On two hours' sleep, I'm watching myself on a stage, trying to process what this last six months has all been about."" Mr. Jones added: ""We're trying to do movie-quality storytelling on a television time-frame and budget. Everyone's slammed around the clock, all the time."" That back-to-back scheduling of its shows seems to have caught up with Marvel: A few days after this set visit, ""Iron Fist"" was released, and it was widely criticized for a first season that felt aimless and a story that inserted a Caucasian hero into an Asian martial-arts milieu. (For Season 2 of ""Iron Fist,"" Marvel has replaced the original showrunner, Scott Buck, with Raven Metzner, citing a scheduling conflict.) A world in which audiences are constantly re-evaluating comic-book narratives would seem to play to the strengths of ""The Tick."" Its tongue-in-cheek story about an invulnerable and lovably dense adventurer in a giant insect costume was first told in a series of comics from the late 1980s, when Batman and a host of caped crusaders were turning gravely serious. Fox ran an animated ""Tick"" series on Saturday mornings from 1994 to 1996, but a live-action prime time comedy, starring Patrick Warburton (""Seinfeld"") ran just nine episodes on the network in 2001. In the years since, Mr. Edlund has continued to work as a writer, producer and director on fantasy and genre shows like ""Firefly,"" ""Angel,"" ""Supernatural"" and ""Gotham."" He has watched as interconnected superhero franchises — the Marvel and DC movies, TV shows on CW and Netflix — have overrun the pop-cultural landscape. (On Monday, Netflix said it was acquiring Millarworld, the comic-book publisher behind the ""Kingsman"" and ""Kick-Ass"" franchises, for new projects.) Through it all, Mr. Edlund wondered if the time was right to bring back ""The Tick."" ""People can't turn around anywhere without seeing 12 superhero dramas,"" said Mr. Edlund, a slender, longhaired man who described himself as possessing ""the proportions of a bike."" The enduring obsession with comic-book characters, he said, ""is a perfect prey for our comedy."" He added, ""You want to be able to laugh at what is, essentially, a sky made gray with a surplus of capes and boots."" Even so, Mr. Edlund said this version of ""The Tick"" actually takes the underlying mythologies of other superhero shows quite seriously. It's a reflection of the stark seriousness he sees in other narratives, and an element that distinguishes the Amazon series from earlier incarnations of ""The Tick."" ""We're utterly hypocritical, putting forward our own very earnest hero myth, as if we're completely oblivious idiots,"" he said. ""I like the meta-level of nonsense that we can be accused of."" The new live-action series is as much about its title character (played by Peter Serafinowicz) as it is about his sidekick, Arthur, who was essentially comic relief in the earlier shows. Arthur (Griffin Newman) is now a young man who, as a child, saw his favorite superhero team and his father killed in a sinister scheme hatched by a criminal called the Terror (Jackie Earle Haley). Years later, Arthur is still disturbed by these events and preoccupied by a paranoid certainty that the Terror remains at large. Then the Tick comes into his life, urging him to accept his destiny as a righted of wrongs, which makes Arthur even more skeptical of his own sanity. Mr. Serafinowicz, a British comic actor (""Spy,"" ""Shaun of the Dead""), said that the show operates in a space ""where superheroes and supervillains exist, and everyone plays it for real."" Speaking from his trailer, where his Tick costume hung nearby like a peeled-off layer of skin, Mr. Serafinowicz described his characters as ""this big, blue lunatic."" ""When he appears,"" he said, ""even the superheroes in this real world are looking at him like, who the hell is this?"" If ""The Tick"" can get away with this blend of solemnity inherent in Arthur's story and silliness provided by its title character, it will be, in part, because the comic-book tropes it plays on are now ubiquitous. Growing up a lonely comic-book fan, Mr. Newman said, ""If someone else said they liked Spider-Man, that was a beacon — 'We have to talk about this.'"" The precise details of superhero origin stories, he said, ""used to be things that a random person stopped on the street wouldn't understand."" Now, Mr. Newman said, ""Everybody knows Batman's parents get killed. Whatever."" For the stars of ""The Defenders,"" a sense of duty comes with their roles — to portray their characters in ways consistent with decades of comic-book continuity and multiple seasons of their own shows. Mr. Cox recalled an early draft of a ""Defenders"" script where his character, Matt Murdock, was supposed to say that a day didn't go by where he didn't wish for his sight to return. But after remembering a scene in a Daredevil comic where the hero says he has no regrets about his blindness, Mr. Cox asked for the line to be changed. ""I question myself less now when I feel strongly about something,"" he said. ""That's the stuff I care about."" On ""The Tick,"" Mr. Edlund said there was honor, too, in taking inspiration from the monolithic media companies responsible for the most popular superhero characters, but telling his own stories on the fringes of the mainstream. His show, he explained, is ""a totally autonomous universe that can borrow from DC or Marvel all it wants, all day, and has the right to be stupid-funny. ""It's true that DC and Marvel are the McDonald's and Burger King in our world. But there's also room for Jack in the Box."""
0,2017-08-16," Amazon's aggressive salesmanship now extends to its own debt. Its blowout $16 billion bond sale suggests almost unlimited potential for Amazon, the retailing juggernaut, to consider even more shopping. Yet in nearly tripling its financial obligations to buy brick-and-mortar Whole Foods Market, Jeff Bezos's company is starting to look more traditional. The risk is that its stock will, too. Mr. Bezos built his online empire by investing cash flow into the business and eschewing conventional corporate finance tools like debt and dividends. A result is a $472 billion goliath — the fifth-largest American enterprise by market capitalization — that has store owners and technology companies quaking over its ambitions. Amazon could have financed the Whole Foods deal by issuing stock with only minimal dilution of his 16.6 percent stake. But as Tesla's Elon Musk did last week, Mr. Bezos took the cheap money available in the fixed-income market. Investors submitted nearly $47 billion in bids, and the company was able to sell its paper at razor-thin margins, including a premium to comparable United States Treasury bonds of just 1.45 percentage points for $2.25 billion of 40-year bonds. A need for yield and a belief that Amazon will triumph from the retail shakeout that it is provoking created a powerful cocktail. The deal will nearly triple Amazon's outstanding debt, to slightly more than $23 billion. That is about a billion dollars less than the consensus estimate for its 2018 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or ebitda. Given the company's cash pile, net debt will be even lower at less than $10 billion. That leaves the underleveraged Amazon with enough financial firepower to consider acquisitions that would make Whole Foods look like an appetizer. Whether that would be good for the company's stock is less clear. Belief in the Bezos vision has pushed Amazon shares up nearly 31 percent this year, and they are trading at 120 times 2018 estimated earnings as calculated by Thomson Reuters Eikon. Walmart Stores, by contrast, fetches 17.6 times earnings. As Amazon begins to more closely resemble peers in its physical footprint and its balance sheet, that gap will inevitably narrow."
1,2017-08-16," After President Trump accused Amazon on Wednesday morning of hurting local retailers and jobs by not paying taxes, the company's shares dipped in premarket trading. ""Amazon is doing great damage to tax paying retailers. Towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt — many jobs being lost!"" he tweeted Wednesday morning, echoing his earlier characterizations of the company as a ""no-tax monopoly"" that does not pay ""internet taxes."" Mr. Trump's suggestion that Amazon does not pay taxes is false. The company, in its latest annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, said that it paid $177 million in income taxes in 2014, $273 million in 2015 and $412 million last year. S&P Global Market Intelligence found that Amazon paid an average tax rate covering federal, state, local and foreign taxes of 13 percent from 2007 to 2015, according to analysis provided to The New York Times. That is a smaller share than the Standard & Poor's 500-stock average of 26.9 percent, and the federal corporate tax rate of 35 percent, but on par with Mr. Trump's proposed 15 percent rate. If Mr. Trump's point was that Amazon did not collect sales taxes — which are owed by the purchaser and collected by the retailer — it is true that the company once avoided doing so. ""If this was five years ago, the tweet would be making a very compelling point,"" said Carl Davis, the research director of the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Historically, ""there is no doubt that Amazon used its ability to not collect sales tax to gain a competitive advantage."" But that criticism is outdated. The Supreme Court ruled in 1992 that a state can require retailers to collect a sales tax only if they have a physical presence in that state, so an out-of-state e-commerce company with no store or distribution center in that state has no obligation to do so. Several states have enacted broad laws, colloquially called ""Amazon laws,"" that attempt to counteract this disparity between e-commerce and brick-and-mortar businesses. As recently as 2012, Amazon was collecting a sales tax in only five states, according Mr. Davis. He also noted that Amazon ""cut ties with in-state businesses to avoid collecting sales tax"" in several states between 2009 and 2014. During this time period, liberal think tanks and analysts made the same point as Mr. Trump about Amazon's effect on localities. ""Amazon's refusal to collect sales tax in most states hurts state and local governments' ability to finance education, health care and other services,"" the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said in 2010. The company began to collect sales taxes in 2012 in California, where it began to build warehouses, as well as in Texas, Pennsylvania and other states, The Times reported. By the end of 2016, Amazon's tax collection had expanded to 29 states, according to Mr. Davis. And as of this April, Amazon has collected sales taxes in all states that have one. (Five states — Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon — do not.) Amazon does not, however, require third-party sellers on its marketplace to collect sales taxes, but offers the service to them. ""Other large e-retailers, most notably eBay, generally do not collect sales tax still,"" said Joseph Henchman, the executive vice president of the free-market-oriented Tax Foundation. Amazon, on the other hand, ""ultimately changed their position."""
0,2017-08-17," Different streaming services have different attitudes toward ""the theatrical experience."" Netflix claims not to be against it, but many cinephiles argue that the service is selective to the point of withholding. The company is clearly reluctant to theatrically distribute its original movies. On the other hand, Amazon seems to be moving toward making a traditional theatrical distribution arm a part of its motion-picture production endeavor. Streaming services that specialize in genre are highly invested in the communities that attach to them. Recently they've been experimenting with enticing their audiences the old-fashioned way, by showing their programs in movie theaters before offering them on their sites. In July, the horror site Shudder showed its new original film ""Kuso,"" the debut feature from Steven Ellison, known as the musician Flying Lotus, in special screenings at the Nitehawk in Brooklyn and Cinefamily in Los Angeles, two venues known for forward-thinking programming. That same month, Crunchyroll, the streaming service devoted to Japanese animation, with a strong suit in ""simulcasting"" anime programs soon after their TV airings in Japan, hosted its second Crunchyroll Movie Night in 300 movie theaters across the United States. I attended the event at the 25-screen AMC Empire multiplex in Manhattan. The Crunchyroll YouTube Channel and podcast personalities Victoria Holden and Reina Scully introduced the program in a taped segment. Things kicked off with a behind-the-scenes look at ""Children of Ether,"" a Crunchyroll original project bringing American and Japanese artistic talent together: the creator LeSean Thomas, who has credits on the American animated series ""Black Dynamite"" and ""The Boondocks,"" and the prolific Japanese animator Hiroshi Shimizu. The series is a sci-fi adventure set in the ruins of a post-apocalyptic Manhattan; the intriguing preview footage was followed by three episodes of ""The Ancient Magus' Bride,"" an adaptation of the popular manga created in 2014 by Kore Yamazaki. Both ""Ether"" and ""Bride"" are, like many anime movies and shows, fantasy stories featuring young protagonists who possess powers they are initially ignorant of and have trouble controlling. (See the character Tetsuo in the classic 1988 anime feature ""Akira,"" which was also adapted from a manga.) The 370-seat AMC Empire was about three-quarters full by the time the lights went down, and sitting through Crunchyroll Movie Night was very distinct from almost every other public film screening I've been to in the past decade or even more. For most of the screening, except for the soundtrack of the show itself, it was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. ""Bride"" has what you might call a humdinger of a premise: It begins with a teenage girl, Chise, in chains, being sold as a slave to a very tall individual with a human body and an antelope's skull and horns for a head. This character is a magus, and he sees in Chise what others do not — that she possesses great magical power. The initial episodes have the magus protecting Chise from impish fairies, taking her to a dragon-populated Iceland and introducing her to colleagues in the magic arts. The series follows a convention common in manga: When the characters are angry, or act awkwardly, or crack bad jokes, they are rendered as caricatures of themselves. These provided the laughs in the story, and the audience at Crunchyroll Movie Night responded with enthusiastic good humor. Otherwise, attentive silence. A couple of days before the event, Crunchyroll's chief operating officer, Colin Decker, told me that the site was created in 2006 by American software engineers who were also anime fans, and who wanted to create a way to access brand-new anime from Japan without resorting to piracy. Now, he said, Crunchyoll is the ""largest international distributor of anime."" The site-app has more than one million paid subscribers and over 20 million registered users. A good deal of its content can be accessed for free, with ads, and at a resolution of 480p; there are two levels of premium subscriptions, one for $6.95 a month and another at $11.95, both of which eliminate ads and feature high-definition 720p and 1080p. The simulcasting model is currently the most vibrant part of Crunchyroll's programming, and getting the material out as quickly as possible for the international audience is a challenge. But fans have turned out to be a big help, Mr. Decker said. ""We reached out to fans and found many of our subtitling people from the fan community, and they make sure the translations are as accurate as possible, and that titling is done as quickly as possible."" That translation is a tall order for a site that subtitles its content in seven languages (and two dialects of Spanish). While I was interested in the site's Movie Night initiative, I was also curious about whether Crunchyroll would add more feature-film fare, particularly classic anime, to the site. Mr. Decker, who once taught film at Harvard, said that ""historical material is something I'm very interested in."" ""We're looking at producing some documentaries about landmarks in anime,"" he continued. ""We're constantly looking around and saying 'Someone's got to do this!,' and then it turns out that someone has to be us."" One of the things Crunchyroll has done is initiate an Anime Awards poll. (Last year, the Anime of the Year was ""Yuri!!! on ICE,"" about a young Japanese figure skater, which is as lively as its title's spelling suggests.) Although the ratio of feature films to simulcasts and archived series is pretty low at the moment, Crunchyroll is an eye-opening streaming experience, and a great way to stay current on trends and innovations in anime. As for Crunchyroll Movie Night, Mr. Decker said that the service doesn't have ambitions for certain kinds of expansion. ""We are not getting into theatrical distribution,"" he said emphatically — as if pre-emptively dodging a bullet. It's Crunchyroll's scale — big, but not too big, like that of Shudder — as well as its genre specialization that enables it to address its subscribers as a community rather than as a market. Which is why you'll probably never see Netflix Movie Night."
1,2017-08-17," HONG KONG — The technology world's $400 billion-and-up club — long a group of exclusively American names like Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon — needs to make room for two Chinese members. The Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings, Chinese companies that dominate their home market, have rocketed this year to become global investor darlings. They are now among the world's most highly valued public companies, each of them twice as valuable as tech stalwarts such as Intel, Cisco and IBM. While American technology giants dominate people's online lives in Western countries, Tencent and Alibaba have soared by essentially carving up China, the world's single-largest internet market with more than 700 million online users. That is roughly twice the size of the population of the United States. Chinese people also spend more money online than Americans. Their surge, which has taken place inside a tightly controlled internet space that has blocked international companies like Facebook, has increasingly set them apart from the rest of China. Despite headline numbers that suggest stable growth, the Chinese economy is grappling with many problems, including heavy debt and continued reliance on rusty industries like steel. Yet Alibaba and Tencent this week both reported financial results that blew past investor expectations, suggesting the future of the Chinese technology world is bright. Their rise is emblematic of a rebalancing of global technological influence. In recent years, places from Paris to Seoul have claimed the mantle of the next Silicon Valley. Yet the cluster of fast-growing start-ups and internet behemoths coming out of China has emerged as the one true rival in scale, value and technology to the West Coast homes of the American technology renaissance. ""We've come to the point where China has finally caught up with the U.S. in the internet space,"" said Hans Tung, a managing partner at venture capital firm GGV Capital. Mr. Tung, who invests in many Chinese start-ups, said the main advantage for Alibaba and Tencent was that the United States still had efficient ""offline"" — or non-internet — options for shopping or entertainment. But in China, where there are fewer appealing options offline, Tencent and Alibaba play a central role in how people buy and pay for goods and services, communicate and entertain themselves. The ascendance of Tencent and Alibaba is evident in their scale. Soon, Tencent will be the only company other than Facebook to have a social network with more than one billion users. (Facebook is still ahead with more than two billion members.) Tencent recently said its messaging app, WeChat — which includes payments and a social network — had 960 million monthly active users. Alibaba has more than 500 million monthly active users for its online shopping apps. Over the past three months, the revenue for both Tencent and Alibaba jumped more than 50 percent from a year ago, meaning they are growing more quickly than both Facebook and Alphabet, the parent company of Google. In Hong Kong, Tencent's market capitalization rose above $400 billion in early trading on Thursday before closing just below that threshold at $396 billion. Alibaba closed in New York trading on Thursday with a market value of $415 billion. The two companies still lag Amazon and Facebook, which are valued at more than $450 billion, and are significantly smaller than Apple, the world's most valuable public company with a market capitalization exceeding $800 billion. In Silicon Valley, some tech companies have begun taking cues from their Chinese rivals. Tencent's WeChat offered speedier in-app articles before Facebook, created a walkie-talkie function before WhatsApp, and made use of QR codes as a way to connect on a social network long before Snapchat. Both Alibaba and Tencent have long been successful in China, but recent events have given them an added push. In China, people often talk about three internet companies that dominate the technology world: Alibaba, Tencent and a search company called Baidu, which is sometimes called the Google of China. But Baidu has stumbled as Chinese users skipped personal computers entirely and turned to smartphones, and it has had trouble competing in a financial arms race between Tencent and Alibaba. The two companies have been plowing money into new businesses like food delivery and online video. Alibaba and Tencent owe part of their success to China's censorship and suspicion of foreign tech firms, which have kept American giants like Facebook and Amazon out of their orbit. But the two have also scored some major technology innovations in their own right. They dominate a smartphone culture that in many ways is superior to that of the United States. Chinese people use their dueling mobile payment systems to settle their restaurant tabs, to shop online, to pay their utility bills, to rent bicycles and even to put money into investments. Despite their size, Alibaba and Tencent are mostly anchored in China, though both are pushing to expand. Most of Alibaba's earnings come from its ad and commissions business in China. The company had just under $400 million in revenue from international commerce. While Tencent has games like League of Legends that are played across the world, the bulk of its revenue comes from games and ads in China. Both have made use of investments and acquisitions to enter into new markets in recent years — with uneven results. Alibaba has invested in a payments company in India, and it bought into three different e-commerce companies in Southeast Asia. With Amazon also readying its own Southeast Asian campaign, the hugely populated region of disparate cultures could be the first place the two e-commerce Goliaths compete face-to-face on neutral ground. Last year, Tencent paid $8.6 billion for Supercell, the maker of the hugely popular smartphone game Clash of Clans. Tencent also wanted to buy the global messaging app WhatsApp but was outmaneuvered by Facebook. The two companies and other Chinese technology names have also opened Silicon Valley research centers and become prominent investors in cutting-edge start-ups. They both have backed a Chinese rival to Uber called Didi Chuxing, which trounced the American company in China and is now expanding in other markets. Tencent has been an investor in Snap, the maker of the messaging app Snapchat, and owns some of the world's most popular games. Even with their new pre-eminence, Tencent and Alibaba face some daunting challenges. China's internet world cannot grow forever, and both companies have stumbled in many of their efforts to get their popularity at home to translate into success in the United States and other markets. Both have made expensive forays into Hollywood with lackluster results. And they face rising pressure from a Chinese government that has become increasingly aware of the power of digital information — and has plans to use it to better track its populations. Still, there is an opportunity for the companies to emerge as global leaders in areas like gaming, e-commerce and communications, said David Chao, co-founder of the venture capital firm DCM Ventures. ""They're a legitimate force to be reckoned with on the world stage,"" he said. For now, a market of 700 million internet users in China is enough to keep Alibaba and Tencent going. Consider that the world's biggest moneymaking smartphone game is a China-only title called Honor of Kings that is more widely played than Pokémon Go at its peak. In the game, players can spend real money to upgrade their online personas and arrange digital fights through social media. Honor of Kings is owned by Tencent. ""The majority of businessmen in China now are playing the game,"" said Zhang Guangyi, 25, a businessman from Beijing who estimates he has spent about $1,500 in the game. ""Once I met a client and when we added each other on WeChat, I noticed that he was also playing and that my level is higher than his. I proposed that I escort him in the game. Soon after that, we had the contract signed."""
0,2017-08-18," PALMER, Alaska — For years, pet owners in this Anchorage suburb of big homes and lawns have fretted over snares set in the local parks by fur-trappers going after fox, lynx and rabbits. But in a quiet revolution this spring, dog lovers got the upper hand, and after a series of public meetings where few trappers showed up to fight back, trapping was banned by the borough council. The suburbs had won. ""That part of old Alaska is moving further out into the bush,"" said Mike Albright, 44, a business owner who was lounging at a park with his three dogs on a recent afternoon. ""It's a good thing."" Alaska will always be different, if only by its size, climate and the grandeur of its open spaces. Senator Lisa Murkowski's recent votes against repeal of the Affordable Care Act in Congress also reinforced the perception that people here are go-it-alone independent thinkers, shaped by their far remove from the more settled, politically divided lower 48. But many longtime residents, writers and businesspeople here said that the sense of ""only in Alaska"" exceptionalism underlying this place and its identity for generations is fading. Improvements in communications and transport are shrinking the sense of physical distance. High-speed internet is reaching tiny villages, opening communities and families to greater connection with the outside world for everything including social media and commerce. ""The world is flat and getting flatter,"" said Rick Zerkel, a pilot in Anchorage and president of an airfreight company, Lynden Air Cargo, that ships goods around the state. Mr. Zerkel said he remembers not so many years ago spending $75 for a 10-minute phone call back home to his wife when he flew to a remote part of Alaska for work. Now, satellite, cable and microwave based communications — aiming to reach the tiniest island and inland settlements in the next few years — are making talk cheap and distance irrelevant. Demographic changes are also reshaping the state, especially here in Anchorage, the largest city. Three of the most ethnically diverse public high schools in the nation are in Anchorage, a district where about 100 different languages are spoken by students. Newcomers from Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa, drawn by tourism and service jobs, have reshaped city neighborhoods and created a wave of fusion food restaurants serving everything from banh mi burgers to Alaskan halibut po' boys. ""Anchorage doesn't look that much different than Seattle,"" said Chad R. Farrell, a sociology professor at the University of Alaska Anchorage, referring to the new demographic tide. But, he added, not all Alaskans are comfortable with that idea. Dan Fischer, an artist in the fishing and tourism town of Homer, a five-hour drive south of here, saw a more ambivalent culture change in his corner of the state with the arrival of Amazon Prime and free shipping. He and other artists long depended on tourists for a living in selling art, and local supply shops for the materials to make that art. Amazon upended all that, he said, by connecting artists with new supply lines and buyers around world. About 70 percent of Mr. Fischer's art lamps, made from local beach stones, now ship out through Amazon, he said, up from zero less than two years ago. Homer as an art colony, he said, is not the same. ""We gained access, but lost some of our uniqueness,"" Mr. Fischer said. Economic contraction is part of the new ethos, too. Alaska is now in its second year of recession as an economy tied to oil has sputtered with declining production and prices. More jobs have been lost than in any downturn in three decades, according to state figures, and the unemployment rate is now the highest in the nation at 7 percent. Charles Wohlforth, an author and columnist who has written about the state for decades, said the old oil economy propped up the sense by many Alaskans that life was inherently different here, through the blue-collar jobs it created by the thousands and the taxes that oil companies paid. The State Legislature has now been considering new taxes to replace lost revenue from the oil decline, and those taxes look a lot like the ones that people pay in the rest of the country. ""We're going to be kind of a regular place,"" Mr. Wohlforth said. And it won't, he said, look like the hip, thriving cities of the East and West Coasts. ""We're actually going to look like the middle of the country, which is kind of a declining blue-collar area that has lost its main economic reason to exist and bounces along with whatever we can manage."" Victor Fischer, who came here in 1950 and helped lead the drive for Alaskan statehood in 1959, says the gloomy talk of lost distinctions and decline is wrong. The next chapter of Alaska will be unquestionably different, said Mr. Fischer, who is 93. With fewer oil jobs, there might even be something like a return to the old smaller, tougher state where great jobs didn't grow on trees, he said. But young people looking for a place with fewer boundaries will still come, he said, and in that there is hope. ""There are young people still coming to Alaska with a gleam in their eye,"" said Mr. Fischer, who is no relation to Dan Fischer, the artist. ""They come because Alaska is still a frontier, because they care about the environment, climate change and polar bears,"" he said. ""Smaller would not necessarily be worse — in some ways it might be better."" Either way, the politics are changing, with hardening divisions that could shake the old traditions of the go-it-alone Alaska epitomized by Ms. Murkowski and Gov. Bill Walker, the nation's only independent, party-unaffiliated governor. Five months after President Trump won the state with 51 percent of the vote, Anchorage voters shifted left in elections to the local Assembly and put the first two openly gay candidates in city history into office, according to the Victory Fund, a group that tracks and supports gay politicians. People in both parties have said they intend in coming elections to strongly go after native Alaskan voters in rural areas, who have supported both Republicans and Democrats in the past. Out-of-the-way places that once were more likely to fight over the idea of whether or not to have a traffic light have also been pulled into the fray. For example, Homer, population 5,600, divided into angry camps earlier this year after the town council adopted a resolution that some residents said was aimed at making the place a ""sanctuary city."" Politics spilled into the arts, too, when the Homer Council on the Arts, in putting together its budget, heard from some donors who said that President Trump's election had changed their giving. "" 'We're giving to the A.C.L.U. instead,' "" said Sallie Rediske, the group's president and chairwoman, quoting one donor. Mr. Albright, the park visitor who was sitting with his three dogs (a Yorkie, a Westie and a Pomeranian-poodle crossbreed), said new Alaska and old might not quite have settled their differences, either. For many Alaskans, rules are meant to be broken, he said, and despite the ban on trapping, you still see some traps. ""Some people are probably just going to keep doing it,"" he said, ""because it's still Alaska."""
0,2017-08-21," In the 1980s, an ecologist named Thomas Lovejoy conducted an unusual experiment in Brazil's Amazon rain forest. As loggers moved in with chain saws to clear trees for cattle pasture north of Manaus, he asked them to leave untouched several small ""islands"" of forest to see how the animals within them fared. The results were unsettling. Even in the largest protected forest fragments, 250 acres in size, the number of bird species living beneath the canopy declined by half within 15 years. The smaller isolated populations were far more likely to succumb to disease or climate fluctuations or demographic bad luck than a larger population would have. That experiment helped establish a grim rule of thumb among biologists: When a species becomes isolated in a small disconnected patch of habitat, unable to breed with larger populations elsewhere, it runs a much higher risk of going extinct locally. And since many of the world's forests are increasingly fragmented, carved up by roads and farms, it seems inevitable that many species within those remaining patches will soon vanish forever. But in recent years, some ecologists have asked whether they can help stave off an extinction crisis by, in effect, running Dr. Lovejoy's experiment in reverse. The idea is to link together the world's remaining forest islands by planting small corridors of trees between them, allowing native birds, mammals and plants to spread between the fragments, mingle with their brethren and become more resilient against extinction threats. In a new paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, released Monday, scientists tried to quantify how this ""wildlife corridor"" strategy might be used to slow extinction rates in two biodiversity hot spots, the Atlantic Forest of Brazil and the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania. ""We've known for a while that fragmentation elevates extinction rates and that these corridors can help,"" said Clinton Jenkins, an ecologist at the Institute for Ecological Research in Brazil and a co-author of the study. ""But we wanted to take that data and figure out what we'd actually gain by putting these forests back together."" In the stretch of Atlantic Forest north of Rio de Janeiro, home to the endangered golden lion tamarin, a bright orange primate, the researchers identified 20 areas where corridors could be planted — small forests just six-tenths of a mile wide — to reconnect existing habitats. Doing so, they found, would create more than 500,000 acres of continuous forest and slow the predicted rate of extinctions. On average, the populations in the connected forests were expected to survive 13 times as long as they would in isolated forest fragments. While the paper largely depended on modeling, this work isn't entirely hypothetical. One of the co-authors, Stuart L. Pimm, an ecologist at Duke University, has been working since 2005 to build actual wildlife corridors linking scattered patches of Atlantic Forest through his nonprofit, Saving Species. Although the newly built corridors need to be studied in more detail, Dr. Pimm said, early signs are encouraging. ""We're already observing golden lion tamarins passing through, which means they're less likely to be isolated, they can meet tamarins elsewhere, and local populations are less likely to wink out,"" he said. The authors make the case that such corridors would be relatively cheap, costing an estimated $21 million to $49 million to reconnect fragmented forests in Brazil and Tanzania. Such corridors, they note, may also help plant and animal species adapt to climate change by making it easier for them to migrate to cooler habitats and higher elevations as temperatures rise. ""The idea we wanted to get across is that reconnecting these landscapes doesn't cost all that much if you're smart about it,"" Dr. Jenkins said. ""You don't have to bring back the forest everywhere to create a lot of positive benefits."" Daniel Simberloff, an ecologist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, who was not involved in the study, cautioned that the research relied heavily on debatable modeling assumptions. Because threatened species decline over many decades, it is difficult to assess the full benefits of corridors directly. It can take several decades for replanted corridors to blossom into lush forests that birds feel comfortable traveling through, the authors noted. Given that many species are predicted to disappear from their fragments in less than a decade, even a well-designed corridor may prove too little, too late for some. More broadly, Dr. Simberloff argued that overhyping the benefits of corridors may mislead people into thinking ""we can make a meaningful contribution to conservation on the cheap,"" when larger-scale efforts to protect and rebuild forests may ultimately prove necessary to save their native species. But Nick Haddad, a conservation biologist at North Carolina State University who has studied wildlife corridors extensively but was not involved in the study, argued that corridors can slow extinctions in the short term while larger efforts get underway. ""This paper offers good evidence that you can get a lot of bang for the buck with corridors,"" he said. Still, building wildlife corridors is not always easy, Dr. Jenkins said. It often requires buying farmland and painstakingly regrowing forests, keeping out invasive grasses and preventing fires. In some areas, conservationists may need to build large forested bridges over highways to allow species to pass through. ""You can't just go in and plant trees and walk away,"" Dr. Jenkins said. ""The key to making these corridors work is often to make sure local people are involved and committed to taking care of them."""
1,2017-08-21," Here's a look at what's coming up this week. FOOD INDUSTRY Shareholders of Whole Foods Market are scheduled to meet Wednesday to vote on Amazon's $13.4 billion takeover bid for the grocery chain. Investors are expected to approve the offer, worth $42 a share — or 27 percent higher than the price that Whole Foods' shares had been trading at before the bid was announced in June. Michael J. de la Merced ECONOMY The American economy is on increasingly solid footing, posting solid growth in consumer and business spending. This has led many economists to forecast that the United States' gross domestic product will grow at or around 3 percent this quarter — a rate the economy hasn't hit since 2015. Will this pace hold? Two indicators this week — new home sales in July, released Wednesday, and existing home sales that same month, released the next day — will give added insight into whether the recent gains in consumer and business sentiment have filtered more broadly into the economy and housing market. Conor Dougherty  Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, will deliver a speech on financial stability on Friday at the Fed's annual economic policy conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo. The Fed is widely expected to announce in September that it will begin to reduce its investment portfolio of Treasury securities and mortgage bonds, but Ms. Yellen is not expected to address monetary policy at the conference. Instead, the speech is likely to focus on regulatory issues. President Trump is seeking to loosen some of the constraints imposed on the financial industry in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials see room for improvement, but have cautioned against reversing those changes, which they regard as important protections against crises. This could be Ms. Yellen's last speech at Jackson Hole as Fed chairwoman. Her term ends in February, and Mr. Trump is considering whether to replace her. Binyamin Appelbaum  Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, will be the lunchtime speaker at the economic policy symposium in Wyoming. In 2014, Mr. Draghi used the same event to signal that the European Central Bank would begin a stimulus program based on purchases of government bonds. There had been speculation that he might use this appearance at Jackson Hole to signal that the European Central Bank was preparing to wind down the stimulus program. But lately, the central bank has been lowering expectations of a major policy speech. Jack Ewing SOUTH KOREA On Friday, a verdict is expected in the trial of Lee Jae-yong, the vice chairman and heir apparent of Samsung Group. Mr. Lee faces charges that he bribed South Korean government officials to solidify his family's control of Samsung, one of the world's biggest business empires. Prosecutors recommended that Mr. Lee be sentenced to 12 years in prison and other Samsung executives to 10 years in a trial that has been obsessively followed by the South Korean public. Analysts have said it is also a referendum on the country's commitment to punishing corporate oligarchs who have often been able to skirt tough sentences and convictions in the past. Paul Mozur"
0,2017-08-23," SAN FRANCISCO — Google and Walmart are testing the notion that an enemy's enemy is a friend. The two companies said Google would start offering Walmart products to people who shop on Google Express, the company's online shopping mall. It's the first time the world's biggest retailer has made its products available online in the United States outside of its own website. The partnership, announced on Wednesday, is a testament to the mutual threat facing both companies from Amazon.com. Amazon's dominance in online shopping is challenging brick-and-mortar retailers like Walmart, while more people are starting web searches for products they might buy on Amazon instead of Google. But working together does not ensure that they will be any more successful. For most consumers, Amazon remains the primary option for online shopping. No other retailer can match the size of Amazon's inventory, the efficiency with which it moves shoppers from browsing to buying, or its many home delivery options. The two companies said the partnership was less about how online shopping is done today, but where it is going in the future. They said that they foresaw Walmart customers reordering items they purchased in the past by speaking to Google Home, the company's voice-controlled speaker and an answer to Amazon's Echo. The eventual plan is for Walmart customers to also shop using the Google Assistant, the artificially intelligent software assistant found in smartphones running Google's Android software. Walmart customers can link their accounts to Google, allowing the technology giant to learn their past shopping behavior to better predict what they want in the future. Google said that because more than 20 percent of searches conducted on smartphones these days are done by voice, it expects voice-based shopping to be not far behind. ""We are trying to help customers shop in ways that they may have never imagined,"" said Marc Lore, who is leading Walmart's efforts to bolster its e-commerce business. He came to Walmart last year after the retailer bought the company he founded, Jet.com. Google is a laggard in e-commerce. Since starting a shopping service in 2013, it has struggled to gather significant momentum. Initially, it offered free same-day delivery before scrapping it. It also tried delivery of groceries before abandoning that, too. If Amazon is a department store with just about everything inside, then Google Express is a shopping mall populated by different retailers. There are more than 50 retailers on Google Express, including Target and Costco. Inside Google Express, a search for ""toothpaste"" will bring back options from about a dozen different retailers. Google said it planned to offer free delivery — as long as shoppers met store purchase minimums — on products purchased on Google Express. Google had charged customers a $95 a year membership for free delivery. Amazon runs a similar program called Amazon Prime, offering free delivery for members who pay $99 a year. The partnership with Google represents one of several steps that Walmart has taken over the past year to strengthen its online business. In January, Walmart began offering free, two-day shipping on more than two million items — a move that takes direct aim at Amazon Prime, whose members who pay an annual fee for fast shipping and other services like movie streaming. Walmart has also been trying to integrate its digital business with its vast network of more than 4,690 stores. Many brick-and-mortar retailers are struggling with what to do with their increasingly empty stores, but Walmart is partially repurposing its stores into e-commerce fulfillment centers. Customers can now order their groceries online and then pick them up at hundreds of stores. For some items that they purchase online and pick up in a store, customers receive a discount. In-store pickup reduces shipping costs for Walmart, but offers a similar level of convenience to the shopper as home delivery. The efforts seem to be paying off. Walmart said last week that its online sales — including online grocery — increased 60 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier. It was a big driver in the company's overall increase in quarterly sales. Efforts like online grocery seem to be gaining traction, but Walmart hopes the benefits of other moves — like its $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com, an online retailer focused on urban millennials, and its purchase of the boutique clothing businesses Modcloth and Bonobos — will come down the road. Some analysts question how Walmart will add to its core low-price retail business at the same time it is trying to manage bolt-on acquisitions. While the company's sales were up, its profit margins in the second quarter slipped, in part because of its spending on e-commerce initiatives. With this new partnership, Google Express will offer items only from Walmart.com, and not from Jet.com or Walmart's online clothing sites. ""Walmart can't lose on the low-cost proposition,"" said Erich Joachimsthaler, chief executive of Vivaldi, a brand consulting firm. ""But convenience, convenience that is where the game lies."" Walmart has a long way to go to catch Amazon. Walmart's website sells 67 million items, up from 10 million early last year. Amazon sells hundreds of millions of items. In July, about 83.6 million people visited Walmart's website, nearly half as many visitors as Amazon had, according to comScore, a media measurement company. Jet drew an additional 10.9 million visitors. ""I am not saying Walmart is ever going to catch Amazon online,"" said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail research and consulting firm. ""But instead of being embarrassed by Amazon, it can be a strong No. 2."""
1,2017-08-23," SEATTLE — Amazon's bid to become a bigger player in the grocery business took a major step forward Wednesday, as federal antitrust regulators approved the internet company's acquisition of Whole Foods Market. And earlier in the day, Whole Foods shareholders voted to approve the $13.4 billion deal, which will give Amazon a major bricks-and-mortar presence with more than 460 stores in a huge retail category where success has eluded the company. The Federal Trade Commission, which was handling the federal review of the deal, said in a statement Wednesday afternoon that the agency had concluded that the deal would not harm competition. ""Based on our investigation we have decided not to pursue this matter further,"" Bruce Hoffman, the acting director of the F.T.C.'s bureau of competition, said in the statement. ""Of course, the F.T.C. always has the ability to investigate anticompetitive conduct should such action be warranted."" The agency's approval removed the last major hurdle to the deal's closing. Antitrust lawyers had not expected the acquisition to be blocked by regulators, largely because Amazon and Whole Foods are not major competitors today.Amazon has run an internet grocery business, AmazonFresh, for a decade, but it accounts for less than a 2 percent share of total grocery spending in the United States, according to estimates by Cowen & Company, a stock research firm. Amazon has said the deal is expected to close this year, and on Wednesday the company did not change that prediction. Despite its prominence as a purveyor of high-end groceries, Whole Foods is also a relatively small player in the overall grocery market. The food and beverage portion of the grocery business is one of the largest categories of consumer spending, totaling more than $800 billion a year, with more than $450 billion in additional spending on personal care, pet and other consumable products, according to Cowen. Combined, Cowen estimates Amazon and Whole Foods will be the fifth-largest grocery retailer in the country. Even if it seemed a long shot that regulators would stop the acquisition, there was still some uncertainty over the way competition regulators under the Trump administration would approach big acquisitions. There has been speculation about possible interference by the White House in antitrust reviews of deals like AT&T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner. In the case of Amazon, President Trump has on several occasions expressed his animosity toward the company, accusing it earlier this month of killing retail jobs. He has also falsely accused the company of not collecting taxes on internet sales and has suggested that Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is using his personal ownership of The Washington Post to intimidate members of Congress from examining Amazon."

He was in high school when he first drew the character, and he's gone on to be a writer and producer of all three TV shows (each named ""The Tick""). Given yet another shot, he hasn't written a sequel. He's given us a refurbished version of the basic ""Tick"" story, a deserved do-over after the truncated 2001 series, which made its debut on Fox two months after Sept. 11 and lasted just nine episodes. Now that we have all that straightened out, here's a suggestion: binge the 2001 series first. (It's $7.99 at iTunes.) It won't spoil your enjoyment of the new show, but the reverse might not be true. The new ""Tick,"" based on six of its 10 episodes, is bigger in just about every way than the old. It has more back story, more exposition, more special effects, more (and more graphic) violence. It's more knowing, more layered, more self-conscious. Where the 2001 show was a quirky, low-fi, episodic lark, the new show is an up-to-date serialized dramedy that feels an awful lot like all the other 10-episode streaming series out there — take away the laughs and it could be a Netflix-Marvel production. Is that an improvement? It's a matter of taste. You may appreciate having more information about why cartoonish superheroes and villains — parodies of the serious crime fighters and criminals at Marvel and DC — walk the earth. You may be drawn in by the continuing story, in which the relationship of the Tick (Peter Serafinowicz) and his sidekick, Arthur (Griffin Newman), develops in a more linear and coherent fashion than it did before, with a more well-defined nemesis (the Terror, played by Jackie Earle Haley). Or you may feel that the addition of all that plot slows things down, and that less actually happens. You may feel that — as in so many other peak-TV series — ""nuance"" brings with it an unwelcome sentimentality. You may miss the 2001 show's charm and innocence, and feel that the Tick's bombastic dialogue isn't as funny this time around. (There's nothing in the new show so far to match, ""I am the sterling-silver ladle of justice, pouring its foamy cream over the just-picked strawberries of crime."") And despite Mr. Serafinowicz's quite capable performance, you may miss Patrick Warburton's Tick — less perceptive, more like a giant, earnest puppy, and funnier. To find out, of course, you'll need to watch both shows, so you'd better get started."
1,2017-08-24," SEATTLE — The era of Whole Paycheck, the derisive nickname for Whole Foods, may be drawing to a close. Amazon, which takes control of the upscale grocer on Monday, intends to slash prices the same day. The significance of the move goes well beyond the price of organic avocados, baby kale and rotisserie chickens, all of which will cost less on Monday than on Sunday. Rather, it is an outsize way for Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, to announce his plan to shake up the grocery industry and take on competitors like Walmart and Kroger. ""This is how Amazon operates,"" said Michelle Grant, head of retailing at Euromonitor, a market research firm. ""It's all about speed, speed, speed."" Mr. Bezos has always been willing to lose money, disappoint shareholders and start discount wars in his efforts to challenge and inflict pain on competitors. In the 23 years that Amazon has been in business, he has done it again and again — with books, diapers and now groceries — fundamentally changing entire retail categories. ""I absolutely think it's putting the rest of the market on notice,"" Bob Hetu, an analyst at Gartner, the technology research firm, said of Amazon's announcement on pricing. Investors drove Kroger shares down more than 8 percent on Thursday; shares of Walmart, the nation's biggest grocer, fell about 2 percent. Both companies' shares also fell sharply when the deal was announced in June. Amazon plans to weave together its online business and physical stores by turning its Prime membership program into a Whole Foods rewards program, providing additional savings to customers. Amazon Prime is a $99-a-year service that gives customers faster free shipping, video streaming and other benefits. Whole Foods' private-label products will be available through Amazon's online services and Amazon lockers that will be installed in some Whole Foods markets. Customers will also be able to return online orders to Amazon through the lockers. ""We're determined to make healthy and organic food affordable for everyone,"" Jeff Wilke, the executive who runs Amazon's consumer businesses, said on Thursday in an announcement about the changes. ""Everybody should be able to eat Whole Foods Market quality."" Discounts are not the only reason shoppers use Amazon — selection and convenience are others — but Mr. Bezos has never been shy about starting price wars that inflict pain on rivals. In the 1990s, the company tussled with Barnes & Noble to see which could discount books the most. Amazon and Walmart have been in an on-and-off price war in a variety of categories for years. In its battle with Quidsi, a start-up that owned Diapers.com, Amazon put so much pressure on the company that it eventually agreed to be acquired by Amazon rather than by Walmart. Ever since Amazon made the surprise announcement in June that it was acquiring Whole Foods for more than $13 billion, competitors have expected it to shake things up at the grocer, which has struggled in the face of competition from Costco, Walmart and others that have wooed customers with a growing selection of organic produce and kitchen staples. (Gabrielle Sulzberger, a private equity executive who is married to Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., the chairman and publisher of The New York Times, is the chairwoman of Whole Foods.) Still, the speed with which Amazon completed the acquisition and embarked on a price-cutting campaign is stunning. Amazon completed the purchase in under three months — unusual for a multibillion-dollar transaction. The Federal Trade Commission approved the deal on Wednesday. Amazon did not say how much it would cut prices in Whole Foods stores, 460 of which are spread across the United States, Canada and Britain. It promised that there would be further cuts in the future. People who have studied Whole Foods' struggles in the marketplace said the reductions would have to be substantial to compete with other stores. ""I believe what we will see is Amazon and Whole Foods becoming aggressive on price,"" said Brittain Ladd, a strategy consultant who previously worked for Amazon on its grocery business. ""I won't be surprised if some prices are lowered 15 percent to as high as 25 percent in some categories."" Mr. Wilke of Amazon said in his statement that lowering prices would not compromise the quality of products at Whole Foods, the brand's main selling point. The items the company said it would drop prices on include bananas, butter, crunchy almond butter, organic large brown eggs, responsibly farmed salmon and tilapia and organic Fuji apples. A number of groups, including members of Congress and representatives of organized labor, have raised concerns about how the acquisition may affect competition in the grocery business, but the Federal Trade Commission had no trouble with it. Antitrust lawyers noted that Amazon and Whole Foods were relatively small players in the grocery business and in different corners of the market — Amazon in online grocery delivery and Whole Foods in physical retailing. Those arguments will probably not assuage a growing chorus of Amazon critics who believe it is developing too powerful a grip on retail spending, at least on the internet. Yet Amazon's announcement of immediate price reductions on groceries underscores how the company has managed, so far, to stay on the right side of regulators. ""At the end of the day, the F.T.C. is in the business of watching out for the consumer,"" said Brendan Witcher, a retail analyst at Forrester Research. It remains to be seen whether the deal will revive Whole Foods' fortunes or become a costly move into an industry that Amazon has so far failed to master. Amazon has offered its own internet grocery business, AmazonFresh, for a decade, but has had little impact on the habits of consumers, who overwhelmingly prefer buying their groceries in stores. Amazon is experimenting with automation technologies that could save costs in physical stores by eliminating cashiers, but it has vowed not to use those technologies at Whole Foods to lay off workers. But sharp price cuts on items in stores will put pressure on Amazon to find cost savings elsewhere at Whole Foods, analysts said — for example, by making the logistics network that delivers goods to stores more efficient. After the companies combine, Amazon's competitors in the grocery business will still be vastly larger. Walmart has more than 4,600 stores and last year started making a multibillion-dollar investment in lowering grocery prices. Walmart has also significantly increased its investment in online shopping through acquisitions to better compete with Amazon on its main turf. And this week, Google announced an agreement with Walmart that would allow people buy Walmart items through Google Express, an online shopping mall that has sought, without much success, to compete against Amazon. ""We feel great about our position with our network of stores around the country and fast growing e-commerce and online grocery businesses,"" said Randy Hargrove, a spokesman for Walmart. Local grocers expressed some trepidation about Amazon's aggressive entry into their business, but said it was part of a long history of upheavals and competition. Stew Leonard Jr. is the chief executive of Stew Leonard's, a chain of six grocery stores in New York and Connecticut that focuses on fresh produce. There are several Whole Foods close to his stores, and Mr. Leonard said he had been watching the Amazon deal closely. ""I've been in retail since I was a kid, and I'm always nervous,"" he said. ""Costcos were opening, then Walmarts, then Whole Foods. But at the end of the day, you just have to try and get the freshest corn out there on the sidewalk."""

0,2017-08-28," In private and sometimes in public, Travis Kalanick was fond of describing Uber, the car-hailing service he co-founded and commanded absolutely, as the Amazon of the transportation business. The similarities were clear. Amazon began as an online bookstore, but it was never just about selling books; over two decades, Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, methodically expanded his company's range, operational infrastructure and ambitions to ultimately pose an existential threat to the entire retail industry. Uber, in Mr. Kalanick's expansive vision, was similarly never just about hailing rides. To him, a taxi-like car service has always been a gateway for a business model that he believed would upend the entire trillion-dollar global transportation industry, altering the way people and things move around the world — and turning Uber into one of the handful of American tech giants that will lord over this century. That vision now lies in the hands of Dara Khosrowshahi, the longtime chief executive of the online travel company Expedia, whom Uber on Sunday picked to replace Mr. Kalanick. Mr. Khosrowshahi faces one primary question in that role that has everything to do with ambition: Will the company still aim to become the Amazon of transportation, or will it settle for being the Expedia of its market — one of the largest of several players in its industry, but not expansionist and messianic, hellbent on becoming the next great American technology behemoth? Mr. Khosrowshahi is a cipher in Silicon Valley. Much about the future of transportation, as well as the start-up scene in Silicon Valley, rides on his still unknown plans. Expedia declined to comment and Uber did not return a request for comment. But Mr. Khosrowshahi's past at Expedia sheds some light on his temperament. He has had a largely successful run there, and appears to be a patient operator who can fix an ailing company. His tenure also suggests a very different outlook from Mr. Kalanick's. In one of the biggest misses of Expedia's history, Mr. Khosrowshahi appeared wary of taking a big, potentially lucrative risk on a groundbreaking new idea in his industry — and he came out the loser. To his credit, he helped steer Expedia to adjust from that mistake. But his initial impulse may suggest a more risk-averse mindset than Mr. Kalanick's — though that, of course, may be just what Uber needs now. The story of Expedia's big early miss is well-known in the online travel industry. Expedia was one of the pioneers of online travel bookings. The company was created by a team at Microsoft in 1996 and later merged with properties at the media company IAC, then spun off as an independent public company in 2005, with Mr. Khosrowshahi as C.E.O. Its hotel booking business grew out of an acquisition that Mr. Khosrowshahi made while he was an executive at IAC in the late 1990s, and for several years, it looked unstoppable and deliciously lucrative. Expedia then operated according to what's known as the ""merchant model."" Under this system, when you booked a hotel, you would pay up front to Expedia, which would take a profitable cut of the deal and buy the room on your behalf. Expedia's margins were startling — the company got 25 percent or more of what you paid for the room. But there was a great disrupter on the horizon. As Dennis Schaal, who covers the online travel industry at the travel-news site Skift, has reported, in the mid-2000s a small Amsterdam-based site called Booking.com set about turning the merchant model on its head. Instead of taking a large cut of the room, Booking.com used what is known as the ""agency model."" The site let hotels set their own far smaller commissions — as low as 12 percent. And it also let hotel guests pay when they got to the hotel rather than up front. Mr. Khosrowshahi and his team considered buying Booking.com, but as he explained to Mr. Schaal in 2016, Expedia was too fixed in its ways, and could not tolerate Booking's lower margins. ""I think it was because we were attached to the merchant model and we were attached to high margins at the time,"" he told Mr. Schaal. ""And I think in hindsight that blinded us."" It was a costly mistake. Expedia's biggest competitor, Priceline, swooped in to buy Booking.com — and turned it into a monster. Under Priceline, Booking.com quickly became the largest hotel booking site in the world, because its cheaper model created a dynamic that Mr. Khosrowshahi and others at Expedia had not anticipated. It lowered prices and vastly expanded the number of hotels participating on the site — making Booking.com very popular with hotel-seekers, and making it impossible for hotels to pass up. Ben Thompson, who writes the tech newsletter Stratechery, argued in his Monday edition that Mr. Khosrowshahi deserves credit for recognizing the mistake and working to repair it. Expedia began delving into the agency model and now runs something of a hybrid approach, and in recent years its growth rate has been catching up to Priceline's. This history, Mr. Thompson wrote, might inform how Mr. Khosrowshahi approaches Uber. In the same way that Booking.com became popular with hotel guests because it had the largest inventory of hotels, Mr. Khosrowshahi might understand Uber's secret is its popularity with riders. ""In fact, what makes Uber so valuable — and still so attractive, despite all of the recent troubles — is its position with riders,"" Mr. Thompson wrote. ""The more riders Uber has, the more drivers it will attract, even if the economics are worse relative to other services: driving at a worse rate is better than not driving at a better one."" This sounds reasonable enough. Yet I still found myself fixated on Mr. Khosrowshahi's initial dismissal of Booking.com. I suspect that if you told Mr. Kalanick, not to mention Mr. Bezos, that there was a competitor out there that had figured out a way to sell the same product at a vastly lower price, they would have moved instantly to purchase or copy it, regardless of the risks to short-term profits. Sacrificing lots of money today for a potentially huge share of the market in the future — that's classic Mr. Bezos, and then classic Mr. Kalanick. In fact, that's pretty much what Mr. Kalanick did when he created UberX, a cheaper version of his original black-car service, in response to lower-priced entrants like Lyft. That Mr. Khosrowshahi did not do that suggests he has a very different appetite for risk. It also suggests he may seek to turn Uber into a more normal, slower, less intense, less globe-swallowing company — but perhaps also a better company to work for, and one that may begin making money instead of losing it. For everyone who's had enough of Uber's drama lately, that may be a fine trade."
1,2017-08-28," We went shopping on Monday to see how much cheaper Whole Foods, the supermarket chain known for natural foods and high prices, had become after Amazon took over as its new owner.  Amazon announced last Thursday that it would drop some prices at Whole Foods on Monday, its first day of running the chain often known as ""Whole Paycheck"" for its pricey goods. The announcement, from a company that has upended much of the retailing world, sent shivers through the stock prices of other food chains.  So we compared a basket of goods purchased at Whole Foods at Columbus Circle in Midtown Manhattan last Thursday with the same items purchased at the same store on Monday. We bought products that Amazon had indicated would get a lower price.  We saved some money on the second trip, to be sure. But we also learned the hard way that not all avocados are treated equal. Here are the results. Old price: $5.29. New price: $4.49. Old price: $0.99 a pound.  New price: $0.69 a pound. Old price: $6.19.  New price: $4.49. Old price: $6.99 New price: $6.99 Old price: $7.99. New price: $6.99.  Savings of 14 percent ($24.04 versus $28.02)"
2,2017-08-28," The Amazon vortex won't suck in everyone. That's the verdict of investors in the retail sector. Among potential competitors to the e-commerce juggernaut founded by Jeff Bezos, some – including Ross Stores, Home Depot and AutoZone – may have the wherewithal to withstand Amazon. The market is conferring on them valuations commensurate with, or better than, the one accorded to Amazon. Amazon is already wreaking damage on the shopping landscape. And that will intensify with the completion of its $13.4 billion purchase of Whole Foods this week. Amazon pledged to lower prices and put an end to its reputation as ""Whole Paycheck,"" crushing shares in competing grocers last week. But not all chains selling stuff to consumers are equally in the path of destruction. E-commerce sales made up 9 percent, or some $111 billion, of total retail sales tallying $1.3 trillion in the second quarter, according to the United States Census Bureau. In that same time, Amazon notched $22 billion in North American revenue, suggesting there are still plenty of dollars to fight over. True, investors are betting Amazon will emerge with lots of them. They value its equity and debt at about 1.5 times projected 2020 revenue of nearly $300 billion, Thomson Reuters Eikon data show. Yet Home Depot bests Amazon at 1.8 times projected sales. That may reflect the fact that 40 percent of its online sales are picked up at more than 2,200 stores, giving it a potentially defensible mix of e-commerce and bricks and mortar. The auto-parts chain AutoZone may represent another retail slice that is somewhat resistant to Amazon. The $19 billion company trades at 1.5 times 2020 sales, a recognition that it has created a supply chain that minimizes inventory without crimping a timely ability to fulfill customer orders. Even in apparel, there are bright spots. At 1.4 times projected 2020 sales, Ross Stores, which sells reasonably priced clothing through more than 1,500 outlets, fetches an enterprise valuation close to Amazon's. TJX Companies, operator of TJ Maxx and Marshalls, lingers at 1.1 times sales. That's below Amazon but well above peers like Macy's and Kohl's. Bargain hunting may offer some respite from online price choppers. Once he is done crushing the grocery business, Mr. Bezos may seriously set Amazon's sights on car parts, cheap clothes and home-improvement accessories. For now, though, the market is betting on a few pockets of calm."
0,2017-08-30," RIO DE JANEIRO — A federal judge in Brazil has temporarily halted a plan by President Michel Temer to allow mining in a large area of the Amazon forest, dealing a victory to environmental activists who had denounced the initiative as potentially calamitous. In a ruling issued Tuesday, Judge Rolando Valcir Spanholo said the executive branch had exceeded its authority in rescinding the designation of a 17,700-square-mile region known by the Portuguese acronym Renca as a protected area through a presidential decree. The judge said that only Congress could make that change. The ruling came after the government sought to respond to an international outcry by issuing an updated version of the Renca decree that more broadly outlined steps to mitigate environmental damage, safeguard the rights of indigenous communities and retain protected areas. But opponents say that the plan will hasten development that has encroached on the rain forests and accelerate deforestation and the displacement of native peoples. The injunction was granted in response to a lawsuit filed by Antonio Carlos Fernandes, a lawyer and university professor in the northeastern city of Fortaleza who said he felt compelled to act after reading about the growing opposition to the decree in Brazil and abroad. ""I'm a regular citizen,"" he said in an interview. ""And now I have certainty that a regular citizen can have a lot of strength."" The government has argued that authorizing regulated mining in the region will curb illegal gold mining and generate new jobs. The area also contains deposits of iron and copper. The government has said it will appeal the decision. While the appeal process plays out, regional prosecutors and members of Congress who oppose opening the area to mining are gearing up for a protracted legal and legislative struggle. ""The suspension of President Temer's unilateral decree with its severe threats to vast Amazonian forest offers a welcome and temporary reprieve,"" said Christian Poirier, the program director for Amazon Watch. ""Today's ruling upholds constitutional guarantees and puts the brakes on this drastic regression, but is ultimately vulnerable to being overruled by higher courts."" Some Brazilian celebrities have recently inserted themselves into this and other environmental disputes. ""SHAME!"" the model Gisele Bündchen, who appears to have swayed Mr. Temer on a previous environmental controversy, wrote in a post on Twitter. ""We're auctioning off our Amazon."" In June, after a plea from Ms. Bündchen on Twitter, Mr. Temer vetoed legislation that would have decreased the size of a national forest area in the Amazon. In an uncharacteristic gesture, the president responded on Twitter, announcing his veto. Last week, the issuance of the Renca executive order opening up an area the size of Denmark to mining operations drew criticism from Ms. Bündchen and other celebrities. The future of Renca has become the latest dispute in the fight between Mr. Temer and conservationists, who say the president has become beholden to powerful political factions that represent the interests of the agricultural, ranching and mining industries. Earlier this summer, Mr. Temer, a deeply unpopular leader, avoided standing trial on corruption charges after a majority of members of the House of Representatives voted to spare him. Those votes were widely reported to have entailed some horse trading. Mr. Temer, who came to power last year after the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff, has pared environmental protections and slashed the budgets of agencies that enforce environmental laws and combat illegal deforestation. His government has also cut the budget of the agency tasked with protecting the rights of indigenous communities."
1,2017-08-30," SEATTLE — The crowded pack of voice-controlled digital assistants — Apple's Siri, Google Assistant, Amazon's Alexa and Microsoft's Cortana — are good at numerous things. They can help people play music, set up calendar appointments and check the weather. They can even get two rival tech executives, Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Satya Nadella of Microsoft, to join hands in a rare partnership. For the past year, the two companies have been coordinating behind the scenes to make Alexa and Cortana communicate with each other. The partnership, which the companies plan to announce early Wednesday, will allow people to summon Cortana using Alexa, and vice versa, by the end of the year. It is unusual for big tech companies to cooperate on important new technologies that they want to stand out from the competition. Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google and nearly every other big tech company is pouring huge amounts of money into making digital assistants that are smarter and can do more, seeing them as a new way for people to interact naturally with devices and online services. But Mr. Bezos and Mr. Nadella are concerned that keeping assistants from working together could hold them back. The way they see it, each assistant has unique strengths that could benefit the other assistants. In an interview last Friday at one of Amazon's Seattle high-rises, Mr. Bezos predicted that over time people would turn to different digital assistants — also called ""A.I.s,"" for artificial intelligence — the same way they turn to one friend for advice about hiking and another for restaurant recommendations. ""I want them to have access to as many of those A.I.s as possible."" Mr. Bezos said. As an example, Mr. Bezos cited Cortana's superior integration with Outlook, the popular calendar and email application that is part of the Microsoft Office suite of software. Because Microsoft controls both products, Outlook is integrated more deeply with Cortana than with other voice assistants. Through its collaboration with Microsoft, Amazon said, Alexa users will get answers to some of the same questions that Cortana can now answer — for instance, when is the next budget review with the boss? Initially, getting the two systems to work together is going to be a little awkward. Someone working with an Alexa device will have to say ""Alexa, Open Cortana"" followed by their command, while someone starting with a Cortana machine will have to say ""Cortana, Open Alexa."" The Amazon-Microsoft partnership started in May 2016, when Mr. Bezos raised the idea with Mr. Nadella at Microsoft's CEO Summit, an annual event for business leaders in the Seattle area. Mr. Nadella was receptive to the idea, so a short while later Mr. Bezos emailed a draft of a brief news release that described how their assistants would work together, both men said. It is standard at Amazon to create such news releases for internal consumption as part of what Mr. Bezos calls the company's ""working backward process."" Through that exercise, Amazon's teams depict in writing how a new product or service will look to its customers before engineers write a line of code. In a phone interview, Mr. Nadella compared digital assistants like Cortana and Alexa to competing web browsers that provide access to the same pools of online information. ""The personality and expertise of each one will be such that if they interoperated, the user will get more out of it,"" he said. ""That resonated for me and for him, and then that's what led to the teams working."" Mr. Bezos said he had not reached out to Apple or Google to invite them to join in the effort and does not know if they would want to. ""I'd welcome it,"" he said. ""Hopefully, they'll be inspired by it,"" Mr. Nadella said. ""At least that would be my hope."" An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment, while a Google spokeswoman did not return a request for comment. Apple and Google may see competitive advantages in keeping their A.I.s separate from rival assistants, partly as a way to protect a selling point of their mobile software, iOS and Android. Apple is especially finnicky about wanting to control as much as it can of people's experiences with its iPhones and iPads. ""There's no reason Google or Apple would offer it because they're trying to drive their own ecosystems,"" said Jan Dawson, an analyst with Jackdaw Research, a technology research firm. By contrast, Alexa is mostly used on Echo speakers that sit around a home, and Cortana is largely used on PCs. Amazon says it has sold millions of Echo devices, accounting for around 70 percent of the market for smart speakers, according eMarketer, a market research firm. Microsoft says there are 145 million active monthly users of Cortana through Windows 10. The two companies have struggled in the smartphone business, which makes it hard to get people using Alexa and Cortana outside homes and offices. Amazon and Microsoft are cutting deals with carmakers to integrate their assistants directly into vehicles. While Amazon and Microsoft have released digital assistant apps for mobile devices running Google and Apple software, the apps are not as widespread and using them is usually not as effortless as the ones Apple and Google build into their devices. Eventually, Mr. Bezos predicted, the primary assistant on a device will be smart enough to automatically route a person's request to whichever assistant is best equipped to answer, without needing a verbal introduction between the two. ""In my view of the world, because that would be best for the customer, that's probably what eventually happens,"" he said."

Last week, the issuance of the Renca executive order opening up an area the size of Denmark to mining operations drew criticism from Ms. Bündchen and other celebrities. The future of Renca has become the latest dispute in the fight between Mr. Temer and conservationists, who say the president has become beholden to powerful political factions that represent the interests of the agricultural, ranching and mining industries. Earlier this summer, Mr. Temer, a deeply unpopular leader, avoided standing trial on corruption charges after a majority of members of the House of Representatives voted to spare him. Those votes were widely reported to have entailed some horse trading. Mr. Temer, who came to power last year after the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff, has pared environmental protections and slashed the budgets of agencies that enforce environmental laws and combat illegal deforestation. His government has also cut the budget of the agency tasked with protecting the rights of indigenous communities."
3,2017-08-30," SEATTLE — The crowded pack of voice-controlled digital assistants — Apple's Siri, Google Assistant, Amazon's Alexa and Microsoft's Cortana — are good at numerous things. They can help people play music, set up calendar appointments and check the weather. They can even get two rival tech executives, Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Satya Nadella of Microsoft, to join hands in a rare partnership. For the past year, the two companies have been coordinating behind the scenes to make Alexa and Cortana communicate with each other. The partnership, which the companies plan to announce early Wednesday, will allow people to summon Cortana using Alexa, and vice versa, by the end of the year. It is unusual for big tech companies to cooperate on important new technologies that they want to stand out from the competition. Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google and nearly every other big tech company is pouring huge amounts of money into making digital assistants that are smarter and can do more, seeing them as a new way for people to interact naturally with devices and online services. But Mr. Bezos and Mr. Nadella are concerned that keeping assistants from working together could hold them back. The way they see it, each assistant has unique strengths that could benefit the other assistants. In an interview last Friday at one of Amazon's Seattle high-rises, Mr. Bezos predicted that over time people would turn to different digital assistants — also called ""A.I.s,"" for artificial intelligence — the same way they turn to one friend for advice about hiking and another for restaurant recommendations. ""I want them to have access to as many of those A.I.s as possible."" Mr. Bezos said. As an example, Mr. Bezos cited Cortana's superior integration with Outlook, the popular calendar and email application that is part of the Microsoft Office suite of software. Because Microsoft controls both products, Outlook is integrated more deeply with Cortana than with other voice assistants. Through its collaboration with Microsoft, Amazon said, Alexa users will get answers to some of the same questions that Cortana can now answer — for instance, when is the next budget review with the boss? Initially, getting the two systems to work together is going to be a little awkward. Someone working with an Alexa device will have to say ""Alexa, Open Cortana"" followed by their command, while someone starting with a Cortana machine will have to say ""Cortana, Open Alexa."" The Amazon-Microsoft partnership started in May 2016, when Mr. Bezos raised the idea with Mr. Nadella at Microsoft's CEO Summit, an annual event for business leaders in the Seattle area. Mr. Nadella was receptive to the idea, so a short while later Mr. Bezos emailed a draft of a brief news release that described how their assistants would work together, both men said. It is standard at Amazon to create such news releases for internal consumption as part of what Mr. Bezos calls the company's ""working backward process."" Through that exercise, Amazon's teams depict in writing how a new product or service will look to its customers before engineers write a line of code. In a phone interview, Mr. Nadella compared digital assistants like Cortana and Alexa to competing web browsers that provide access to the same pools of online information. ""The personality and expertise of each one will be such that if they interoperated, the user will get more out of it,"" he said. ""That resonated for me and for him, and then that's what led to the teams working."" Mr. Bezos said he had not reached out to Apple or Google to invite them to join in the effort and does not know if they would want to. ""I'd welcome it,"" he said. ""Hopefully, they'll be inspired by it,"" Mr. Nadella said. ""At least that would be my hope."" An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment, while a Google spokeswoman did not return a request for comment. Apple and Google may see competitive advantages in keeping their A.I.s separate from rival assistants, partly as a way to protect a selling point of their mobile software, iOS and Android. Apple is especially finnicky about wanting to control as much as it can of people's experiences with its iPhones and iPads. ""There's no reason Google or Apple would offer it because they're trying to drive their own ecosystems,"" said Jan Dawson, an analyst with Jackdaw Research, a technology research firm. By contrast, Alexa is mostly used on Echo speakers that sit around a home, and Cortana is largely used on PCs. Amazon says it has sold millions of Echo devices, accounting for around 70 percent of the market for smart speakers, according eMarketer, a market research firm. Microsoft says there are 145 million active monthly users of Cortana through Windows 10. The two companies have struggled in the smartphone business, which makes it hard to get people using Alexa and Cortana outside homes and offices. Amazon and Microsoft are cutting deals with carmakers to integrate their assistants directly into vehicles. While Amazon and Microsoft have released digital assistant apps for mobile devices running Google and Apple software, the apps are not as widespread and using them is usually not as effortless as the ones Apple and Google build into their devices. Eventually, Mr. Bezos predicted, the primary assistant on a device will be smart enough to automatically route a person's request to whichever assistant is best equipped to answer, without needing a verbal introduction between the two. ""In my view of the world, because that would be best for the customer, that's probably what eventually happens,"" he said."

0,2017-09-01," Each Friday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week's news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Mike is out this week so Nick Wingfield, a Times technology reporter based in Seattle, filled in. Farhad: Hello, Nick! I'm so happy you're joining me to chat about tech news in Mike's absence. He spent the weekend covering the many boardroom twists that led to Uber picking its new C.E.O. And now he's off recovering in a Twinkie-addled haze, I think. So, thanks for stepping in. Nick: You're welcome. Is there a rule that there has to be at least one bald guy in each week's newsletter? Farhad: Yes. I'm glad you were up for it or I would have had to shave my head. Farhad: O.K., so this was a busy week in tech. First, there was Uber. As you know, the troubled ride-hailing company has been without a C.E.O. for two months, and its board of directors — which includes former C.E.O. and co-founder Travis Kalanick — has been consumed with tension over a new pick. As Mike explained in his in-depth account of a crazy weekend showdown, the board was picking between three people: Meg Whitman, the longtime eBay C.E.O. who now runs Hewlett Packard Enterprise; Jeff Immelt, the former C.E.O. of General Electric; and a third person whose identity no one on the outside could pin down. Kalanick and his faction backed Immelt, while Benchmark, the venture capital firm warring with Kalanick, backed Whitman. By Sunday morning it looked like Whitman had the whole thing locked up. Then the worm turned. According to Mike, Whitman kept pushing board members to make changes that would curb Kalanick's power — and it appears her tactics backfired. Nick: It's déjà vu all over again. Whitman has a history of being in situations like this. In 2005, Walt Disney was looking for a successor for Michael Eisner, its chief executive at the time. The company seemed to be on the verge of naming Whitman to the job, but she decided to stay as the head of eBay, in part because Disney was taking too long to select a new leader, The Wall Street Journal reported at the time. It wasn't entirely surprising to see the Uber gig fall through. Farhad: Now she'll have more time to take another stab at political office. Anyway, with Immelt out of the way and Whitman overplaying her hand, the mystery third person got the nod. He is Dara Khosrowshahi, who has run the online travel company Expedia since 2005. And now, out of nowhere, he's Uber's new C.E.O. — and so far, he's been getting wide praise from many analysts. (Khosrowshahi is also on the board of The New York Times Company.) To me, Uber's board sounds as dysfunctional as a brunch between the Lannisters and the Starks on Game of Thrones, but isn't it kind of interesting that the process yielded a pick who seems pretty reasonable? Nick: I'm going to be a contrarian. Aside from the leaks of candidate names, which are good for us storytellers, I don't think the hunt for a new C.E.O. was all that messy. You kind of hope there is vigorous debate on the board when they're picking a new leader. Of all the dysfunctional, wacky stuff that has gone on at Uber, I wouldn't even put the C.E.O. search in the Top 5. That's grading on a curve though. Farhad: One more thing on Uber. On Wednesday, a judge ruled that the lawsuit that Benchmark had filed against Kalanick should now be moved to arbitration. This makes it easier for Kalanick to shield any unsettling facts from public view. It might also allow both sides to back down more easily — and give Uber a chance to become something of a more normal, less-dramatic company soon. Or not. Nick: I wonder if Uber could become militantly boring now. The crazy at that company must be exhausting for everyone — board members, management, investors, employees. I listened to the leaked audio of Khosrowshahi's remarks to Uber employees this week when his appointment was official. The way he hat-tipped all the warring factions around the company made me think he would make a serious effort at peace. On the other hand, recorded audio leaked of the new C.E.O.'s remarks. Maybe I won't put away the popcorn quite yet. Farhad O.K., let's move to your neck of the woods: Amazon. You had an interesting story about how Jeff Bezos, Amazon's C.E.O., reached out to Satya Nadella, Microsoft's C.E.O., to push for the two companies to integrate their voice assistants, Amazon's Alexa and Microsoft's Cortana. I was surprised by the move; it's a rare moment of cooperation among tech behemoths. One thing I wondered is if it presaged some larger cooperation between the two, on matters even beyond voice assistants. What do you think? Nick: I don't see major partnerships for the two companies down the line. They're serious, respectful rivals in cloud computing. I think part of what drove this relationship is that both are facing real roadblocks to getting people using their assistants outside homes and offices. Microsoft and Amazon are both weak in mobile devices. If they can somehow persuade Apple and Google to join their party, it might be easier to get people using Alexa and Cortana through smartphones Farhad: Then we have Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods, which just closed. To mark the kickoff, Amazon cut prices on a variety of Whole Foods staples. I went to my local Whole Foods around lunchtime yesterday and found it unusually packed. But have you been able to glean anything else about Amazon's long-term plans for Whole Foods, beyond this marketing push? Nick: The initial price cuts were a way to get curiosity seekers in the door on day one, which seems to have worked. Amazon has already talked about various plans to integrate Amazon services with Whole Foods, like making Amazon Prime the loyalty program for the stores. Checkout lines are the single most annoying experience everyone I know has at supermarkets. Amazon has insisted they won't use the cashier-free checkout technology they're testing at their Amazon Go convenience store in Seattle to put people out of work. But if they can get the system working smoothly, I could see Amazon sticking to their promise by giving cashiers new roles inside Whole Foods stores — for example, spending more time answering customer questions. And if they can prove this works through Whole Foods, what's to stop Amazon from selling the entire system to other retailers, the way they do with cloud computing services? Farhad: Oh wow, I hadn't thought about that. See, that's what's great about having you here instead of Mike, Nick. You say smart stuff! Well, thanks for joining me. Talk soon! Nick: See ya!"

0,2017-09-07," Tom Ford, one of fashion's most passionate proponents of sex, glamour and dressing for both, returned to New York Fashion Week on Wednesday night with a runway show calibrated for maximum oomph: a collection modeled by Amazons (Gigi Hadid, Kendall Jenner and Joan Smalls, among them) amply bedazzled but often without pants; Kim Kardashian West and Chaka Khan planted in the front row; and the air thick with the heady scent of Mr. Ford's new fragrance, called, in a perfect Tom Fordism, ""[Expletive] Fabulous."" (The expletive is an amplifying adjective; suffice it to say that Mr. Ford enjoys alliteration.) The fragrance is available in Tom Ford boutiques and at tomford.com. After the show, as the after-party kicked off, Virgil Abloh D.J.ed; shirtless, fatless waiters with gym physiques served Shake Shack burgers; and the unfiltered Mr. Ford, unruffled and suave in his customary suit, took a few minutes to chat. A slightly filtered version of the conversation is below. You don't break a sweat anymore? Oh, I break a sweat six weeks before, when I think. ""What am I going to do?"" Or when the clothes finally get finished, and I think ""This doesn't look the way I thought it was going to look, what am I going to do?"" Then when you're looking on looks, something turns and you have a day where you think, ""Yes, that's it!"" And then the next day, ""That's not it!"" Then, by the time you get to this stage, the clothes are done, they're on the girls, you've made the decisions, the hair's done, the makeup's done, it is what it is, you love it, you feel good. It's always exciting to see the girls totally dressed, everything you've done comes together. I've always been relaxed. But remember, I've been doing this for 30 years. I used to do 16 collections a year. So one per fashion week isn't bad. I don't mean to make it sound glib. I love it, and I have a lot of fun with it. Does it look like you imagined?  I won't know until I see the video or the pictures. Because I'm backstage with the girls. You're zhushing and pinning. I don't zhush. Hopefully I'm not pinning, but something did fall apart, and we had to sew it in the middle of the show, to sew Gigi into her dress. I feel good about it, because I loved it, I loved the collection, I was very happy with the energy, was happy with the music, was happy with the lighting, happy with the set, happy with the girls, happy with the casting, happy with the hair, happy with the clothes. Now I have to go away and look at it and think, ""Yeah, O.K. That was good."" Tell me about the decision to come to New York Fashion Week. We've had a lot of hand-wringing about people leaving New York, and here you are, riding in to take it over? I've shown in Paris a lot. I lived there for 10 years. I've shown in Milan a lot. I've lived in London for the last 20 years. Shown there. I've only shown in New York a few times, but I've based my women's design studio in Los Angeles, and it only made sense to show in New York. As a brand, I've tried a lot of things, and I have the luxury to do that. And it's been great — I'm glad I did. But at this point, what I want to do is establish a consistency. This is our look, this is what I do, this is when I show, this is the city I show in. In a way, if you want to succeed at the game, you have to be in it. So I decided to come to New York Fashion Week. So we'll see you here from here on out? You'll see me here for a quite a while. I have no plans to leave. Ten years, who knows. Next season, I'll be showing here. And the look will remain consistent? You mean the clothes? The spirit, yes. I mean, you have to change the clothes. It's a new season. The spirit. Which is very similar, I hope, to the sort of spirit I had in the '90s, really, at Gucci. Do you feel we've taken a break from that spirit and we're returning to it? I've taken a break from it. I've done a lot of different things. But I think in fashion right now there's a feeling of the '90s. And there's also been a lot of more is more is more is more is more. I wanted to take all that away, go back to something cleaner, sharper. That's what I did. If the '90s are going to be back, who better to do them than you? Well, thank you. Tell me about [Expletive] Fabulous. What's to tell? Was the name a eureka moment? I actually said in a meeting, ""This is [expletive] fabulous."" I thought, ""Why don't we just call it that?"" [Mr. Ford gasps, imitating his audience.] ""We can't say that, how would we do that, how will we advertise, we can't put it on Instagram, what are we going to do?"" It's great. In a recent interview, you said we were all getting very prudish. Was this a way of calling attention back to what really matters? I think we have become quite prudish. Or maybe not ""we,"" but corporations are afraid of offending a certain segment of the market. It's very interesting. We have more personal freedom, and people are so concerned with being politically correct, that sometimes it actually restricts them. So is this an opportunity to put the expletive front and center, where you feel it belongs?  Oh, it's not even that big of a statement. If you're offended by that word … it's not for sale any place a little kid is going to wander in and say, ""Mom, what's that word?"" It's only available in my stores. And, by the way, it's almost sold out, and our waiting list is, like, crazy. I don't know how many millions of impressions we've had. I'm sorry to be the voice of prudery, but I can't publish the name in The New York Times. Is there an alternate name we should use? I think you can publish the name in The New York Times, I've seen it."
1,2017-09-07," SEATTLE — Wanted: A place with a million people, a diverse population, good schools and malleable lawmakers. Room to accommodate up to 50,000 workers. Canadian provinces also welcome to apply. Amazon took the unusual step on Thursday of announcing it wants a second home outside Seattle, starting what is sure to be a fierce bidding war to lure Amazon — and the thousands of high-paying jobs it will bring to town — using a combination of tax breaks and other sweeteners. By the end of the day, cities including Chicago, Dallas and San Diego, along with states like Michigan, were vocal about their interest, the first of many places expected to consider submitting proposals. Amazon has laid out in meticulous detail what it is looking for, even acknowledging that new laws may be required to get the high level of incentives necessary to hold the company's attention. ""This is the trophy deal of the decade as far as I can tell,"" said Greg LeRoy, the executive director of Good Jobs First, a nonpartisan research group that tracks economic development. ""What governor or mayor doesn't want to stand on a stage with Jeff Bezos to announce a deal like this?"" The plan is the latest surprise from Mr. Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, who has reshaped Seattle in the more than two decades since he founded Amazon. He overshadows even Bill Gates, the former Microsoft chief executive who put the Seattle area on the map as a destination for tech companies. Amazon is now the biggest corporate employer in Seattle, and it occupies 19 percent of the prime office space in the city, more than any other employer in a big American city, The Seattle Times reported last month. But Amazon executives have talked internally and with outsiders in recent years about how much more of the company's hyper-growth Seattle would be able to handle. Housing prices here are skyrocketing, the competition for tech industry talent is getting more fierce and traffic chokes the roads. Those considerations and more are laid out in Amazon's detailed wish list for its new project, which it is calling HQ2. In addition to a metropolitan area with more than one million residents, Amazon insists that its new project have on-site access to mass transit, a commute of 45 minutes or less to an international airport and easy access to a major highway or arterial road — no more than two miles. It also asked for evidence of fiber optic internet connections and a coverage map showing strong cellular phone service at the location. Amazon also wants traffic congestion figures, lists of universities and statistics on the qualifications of local workers. The company is also requesting that the new location have a diverse population and recreational opportunities. In other words, it does not want to stray too far from the lifestyle of Seattle, the home of Starbucks and Nordstrom, sandwiched between mountains and water. The headquarters in Seattle has 24 cafes. Already, Amazon is one of the largest tech employers in the world. But the company said the total number of new employees at its second headquarters outside Seattle could reach 50,000. The announcement of its hiring plan comes at a time when President Trump has stepped up his attacks on Amazon on Twitter, accusing the company of hurting retailers and killing jobs. And in Seattle, some local lawmakers have blamed Amazon for being a primary contributor to the region's lack of affordable housing and other woes. The City Council recently unanimously approved a tax on individual income over $250,000 and $500,000 for couples, which would affect high-earners at Amazon. The legislation is facing legal challenges. The local antipathy toward the company was summed up in graffiti that recently appeared on the wall of a busy downtown traffic tunnel: an expletive before the last name of Mr. Bezos. Amazon itself seemed to suggest that it was looking for a more welcoming atmosphere than in Seattle, emphasizing that it is looking for a ""stable and business-friendly environment"" for its new headquarters. ""When big corporations say 'business-friendly' climate, it's code for corporate giveaways and vicious policies seeking to make the biggest possible profits on the backs of working people,"" Kshama Sawant, a socialist member of the Seattle City Council, said in an email. Matt McIlwain, a venture capitalist at Madrona Venture Group in Seattle, said he had heard concerns from executives at Amazon about the climate for businesses in Seattle. ""I recognize there are many factors that went in to Amazon's decision, but the Seattle City Council's focus on dividing the pie of economic opportunity rather than growing the pie for the city and the region is undoubtedly among them,"" he said. Maud Daudon, the chief executive of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, said she has heard similar concerns from Amazon executives and called the company's announcement of its plan a ""wake-up call for the region."" ""We have not said thank you enough"" to Amazon, Ms. Daudon said. Amazon has no plans to leave Seattle, where it employs 40,000 of its 380,000 total workers. It has an additional 6,000 open jobs in Seattle, a sprawling network of buildings downtown, with millions more square feet of office space under construction. Ty Rogers, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment about the plan for the company's new headquarters. Political leaders elsewhere wasted no time saying how badly they want Amazon to join them. ""We will aggressively demonstrate that Dallas and our surrounding area would be the perfect spot for their expansive business needs,"" Mike Rawlings, the city's mayor, said in a statement. Dallas representatives were already in touch with Amazon about next steps, he said. Amazon has been a beneficiary of generous public subsidies as part of its expansion of its warehouse network. The Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonpartisan research and advocacy group, published a report last year saying that Amazon had received forms of public subsidies totaling at least $613 million for 40 of the 77 warehouses it built from 2005 to 2014. Additional subsidies for Amazon data centers were about $147 million, the institute said. Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the institute, was struck that Amazon's formal request for proposals said that ""special incentive legislation"" might be required. ""Cities and states have a wide array of tools for giving corporations tax incentives and subsidies,"" Ms. Mitchell said. ""So the notion that Amazon is imagining a deal of such magnitude that it would require special legislation is pretty brazen."" Timothy J. Bartik, a senior economist at the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Mich., said that the average incentive package from a state usually adds up to 2 to 3 percent of wages, although recently there have been a spate of megadeals, like the $3 billion in state tax credits that Wisconsin offered Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics supplier for Apple and other tech giants. Such outsize offers could end up being a ""winner's curse,"" where the costs outweigh the benefits. He added that such gifts may not even be what is crucial. ""Either you have the things they want or you don't,"" Mr. Bartik said, things like, reasonable housing costs, a pool of skilled talent, an international airport or the kind of amenities that would attract the kind of workers that Amazon wants to hire. When General Electric announced last year that it was moving its headquarters to Boston, G.E. executive said that some of city's most important selling points included the number and quality of its colleges and universities, a technically fluent work force, an atmosphere of innovation and entrepreneurial start-ups, and a quality of life that would attract current and future employees. Tax incentives were a factor, but not the most significant one by far, they said. Ed Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington, said he was not bothered by Amazon's decision, which he said would give another city a chance to become a significant tech hub. ""I think there's no way to accommodate another 50,000 engineers and executives in Seattle,"" he said. ""I also don't think it would be healthy for Seattle to have that. As much as I love Amazon, to have that great a density of a single company, it means you're a one-horse town."""

3,2017-09-07," Tom Ford, one of fashion's most passionate proponents of sex, glamour and dressing for both, returned to New York Fashion Week on Wednesday night with a runway show calibrated for maximum oomph: a collection modeled by Amazons (Gigi Hadid, Kendall Jenner and Joan Smalls, among them) amply bedazzled but often without pants; Kim Kardashian West and Chaka Khan planted in the front row; and the air thick with the heady scent of Mr. Ford's new fragrance, called, in a perfect Tom Fordism, ""[Expletive] Fabulous."" (The expletive is an amplifying adjective; suffice it to say that Mr. Ford enjoys alliteration.) The fragrance is available in Tom Ford boutiques and at tomford.com. After the show, as the after-party kicked off, Virgil Abloh D.J.ed; shirtless, fatless waiters with gym physiques served Shake Shack burgers; and the unfiltered Mr. Ford, unruffled and suave in his customary suit, took a few minutes to chat. A slightly filtered version of the conversation is below. You don't break a sweat anymore? Oh, I break a sweat six weeks before, when I think. ""What am I going to do?"" Or when the clothes finally get finished, and I think ""This doesn't look the way I thought it was going to look, what am I going to do?"" Then when you're looking on looks, something turns and you have a day where you think, ""Yes, that's it!"" And then the next day, ""That's not it!"" Then, by the time you get to this stage, the clothes are done, they're on the girls, you've made the decisions, the hair's done, the makeup's done, it is what it is, you love it, you feel good. It's always exciting to see the girls totally dressed, everything you've done comes together. I've always been relaxed. But remember, I've been doing this for 30 years. I used to do 16 collections a year. So one per fashion week isn't bad. I don't mean to make it sound glib. I love it, and I have a lot of fun with it. Does it look like you imagined?  I won't know until I see the video or the pictures. Because I'm backstage with the girls. You're zhushing and pinning. I don't zhush. Hopefully I'm not pinning, but something did fall apart, and we had to sew it in the middle of the show, to sew Gigi into her dress. I feel good about it, because I loved it, I loved the collection, I was very happy with the energy, was happy with the music, was happy with the lighting, happy with the set, happy with the girls, happy with the casting, happy with the hair, happy with the clothes. Now I have to go away and look at it and think, ""Yeah, O.K. That was good."" Tell me about the decision to come to New York Fashion Week. We've had a lot of hand-wringing about people leaving New York, and here you are, riding in to take it over? I've shown in Paris a lot. I lived there for 10 years. I've shown in Milan a lot. I've lived in London for the last 20 years. Shown there. I've only shown in New York a few times, but I've based my women's design studio in Los Angeles, and it only made sense to show in New York. As a brand, I've tried a lot of things, and I have the luxury to do that. And it's been great — I'm glad I did. But at this point, what I want to do is establish a consistency. This is our look, this is what I do, this is when I show, this is the city I show in. In a way, if you want to succeed at the game, you have to be in it. So I decided to come to New York Fashion Week. So we'll see you here from here on out? You'll see me here for a quite a while. I have no plans to leave. Ten years, who knows. Next season, I'll be showing here. And the look will remain consistent? You mean the clothes? The spirit, yes. I mean, you have to change the clothes. It's a new season. The spirit. Which is very similar, I hope, to the sort of spirit I had in the '90s, really, at Gucci. Do you feel we've taken a break from that spirit and we're returning to it? I've taken a break from it. I've done a lot of different things. But I think in fashion right now there's a feeling of the '90s. And there's also been a lot of more is more is more is more is more. I wanted to take all that away, go back to something cleaner, sharper. That's what I did. If the '90s are going to be back, who better to do them than you? Well, thank you. Tell me about [Expletive] Fabulous. What's to tell? Was the name a eureka moment? I actually said in a meeting, ""This is [expletive] fabulous."" I thought, ""Why don't we just call it that?"" [Mr. Ford gasps, imitating his audience.] ""We can't say that, how would we do that, how will we advertise, we can't put it on Instagram, what are we going to do?"" It's great. In a recent interview, you said we were all getting very prudish. Was this a way of calling attention back to what really matters? I think we have become quite prudish. Or maybe not ""we,"" but corporations are afraid of offending a certain segment of the market. It's very interesting. We have more personal freedom, and people are so concerned with being politically correct, that sometimes it actually restricts them. So is this an opportunity to put the expletive front and center, where you feel it belongs?  Oh, it's not even that big of a statement. If you're offended by that word … it's not for sale any place a little kid is going to wander in and say, ""Mom, what's that word?"" It's only available in my stores. And, by the way, it's almost sold out, and our waiting list is, like, crazy. I don't know how many millions of impressions we've had. I'm sorry to be the voice of prudery, but I can't publish the name in The New York Times. Is there an alternate name we should use? I think you can publish the name in The New York Times, I've seen it."
4,2017-09-07," SEATTLE — Wanted: A place with a million people, a diverse population, good schools and malleable lawmakers. Room to accommodate up to 50,000 workers. Canadian provinces also welcome to apply. Amazon took the unusual step on Thursday of announcing it wants a second home outside Seattle, starting what is sure to be a fierce bidding war to lure Amazon — and the thousands of high-paying jobs it will bring to town — using a combination of tax breaks and other sweeteners. By the end of the day, cities including Chicago, Dallas and San Diego, along with states like Michigan, were vocal about their interest, the first of many places expected to consider submitting proposals. Amazon has laid out in meticulous detail what it is looking for, even acknowledging that new laws may be required to get the high level of incentives necessary to hold the company's attention. ""This is the trophy deal of the decade as far as I can tell,"" said Greg LeRoy, the executive director of Good Jobs First, a nonpartisan research group that tracks economic development. ""What governor or mayor doesn't want to stand on a stage with Jeff Bezos to announce a deal like this?"" The plan is the latest surprise from Mr. Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, who has reshaped Seattle in the more than two decades since he founded Amazon. He overshadows even Bill Gates, the former Microsoft chief executive who put the Seattle area on the map as a destination for tech companies. Amazon is now the biggest corporate employer in Seattle, and it occupies 19 percent of the prime office space in the city, more than any other employer in a big American city, The Seattle Times reported last month. But Amazon executives have talked internally and with outsiders in recent years about how much more of the company's hyper-growth Seattle would be able to handle. Housing prices here are skyrocketing, the competition for tech industry talent is getting more fierce and traffic chokes the roads. Those considerations and more are laid out in Amazon's detailed wish list for its new project, which it is calling HQ2. In addition to a metropolitan area with more than one million residents, Amazon insists that its new project have on-site access to mass transit, a commute of 45 minutes or less to an international airport and easy access to a major highway or arterial road — no more than two miles. It also asked for evidence of fiber optic internet connections and a coverage map showing strong cellular phone service at the location. Amazon also wants traffic congestion figures, lists of universities and statistics on the qualifications of local workers. The company is also requesting that the new location have a diverse population and recreational opportunities. In other words, it does not want to stray too far from the lifestyle of Seattle, the home of Starbucks and Nordstrom, sandwiched between mountains and water. The headquarters in Seattle has 24 cafes. Already, Amazon is one of the largest tech employers in the world. But the company said the total number of new employees at its second headquarters outside Seattle could reach 50,000. The announcement of its hiring plan comes at a time when President Trump has stepped up his attacks on Amazon on Twitter, accusing the company of hurting retailers and killing jobs. And in Seattle, some local lawmakers have blamed Amazon for being a primary contributor to the region's lack of affordable housing and other woes. The City Council recently unanimously approved a tax on individual income over $250,000 and $500,000 for couples, which would affect high-earners at Amazon. The legislation is facing legal challenges. The local antipathy toward the company was summed up in graffiti that recently appeared on the wall of a busy downtown traffic tunnel: an expletive before the last name of Mr. Bezos. Amazon itself seemed to suggest that it was looking for a more welcoming atmosphere than in Seattle, emphasizing that it is looking for a ""stable and business-friendly environment"" for its new headquarters. ""When big corporations say 'business-friendly' climate, it's code for corporate giveaways and vicious policies seeking to make the biggest possible profits on the backs of working people,"" Kshama Sawant, a socialist member of the Seattle City Council, said in an email. Matt McIlwain, a venture capitalist at Madrona Venture Group in Seattle, said he had heard concerns from executives at Amazon about the climate for businesses in Seattle. ""I recognize there are many factors that went in to Amazon's decision, but the Seattle City Council's focus on dividing the pie of economic opportunity rather than growing the pie for the city and the region is undoubtedly among them,"" he said. Maud Daudon, the chief executive of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, said she has heard similar concerns from Amazon executives and called the company's announcement of its plan a ""wake-up call for the region."" ""We have not said thank you enough"" to Amazon, Ms. Daudon said. Amazon has no plans to leave Seattle, where it employs 40,000 of its 380,000 total workers. It has an additional 6,000 open jobs in Seattle, a sprawling network of buildings downtown, with millions more square feet of office space under construction. Ty Rogers, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment about the plan for the company's new headquarters. Political leaders elsewhere wasted no time saying how badly they want Amazon to join them. ""We will aggressively demonstrate that Dallas and our surrounding area would be the perfect spot for their expansive business needs,"" Mike Rawlings, the city's mayor, said in a statement. Dallas representatives were already in touch with Amazon about next steps, he said. Amazon has been a beneficiary of generous public subsidies as part of its expansion of its warehouse network. The Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonpartisan research and advocacy group, published a report last year saying that Amazon had received forms of public subsidies totaling at least $613 million for 40 of the 77 warehouses it built from 2005 to 2014. Additional subsidies for Amazon data centers were about $147 million, the institute said. Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the institute, was struck that Amazon's formal request for proposals said that ""special incentive legislation"" might be required. ""Cities and states have a wide array of tools for giving corporations tax incentives and subsidies,"" Ms. Mitchell said. ""So the notion that Amazon is imagining a deal of such magnitude that it would require special legislation is pretty brazen."" Timothy J. Bartik, a senior economist at the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Mich., said that the average incentive package from a state usually adds up to 2 to 3 percent of wages, although recently there have been a spate of megadeals, like the $3 billion in state tax credits that Wisconsin offered Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics supplier for Apple and other tech giants. Such outsize offers could end up being a ""winner's curse,"" where the costs outweigh the benefits. He added that such gifts may not even be what is crucial. ""Either you have the things they want or you don't,"" Mr. Bartik said, things like, reasonable housing costs, a pool of skilled talent, an international airport or the kind of amenities that would attract the kind of workers that Amazon wants to hire. When General Electric announced last year that it was moving its headquarters to Boston, G.E. executive said that some of city's most important selling points included the number and quality of its colleges and universities, a technically fluent work force, an atmosphere of innovation and entrepreneurial start-ups, and a quality of life that would attract current and future employees. Tax incentives were a factor, but not the most significant one by far, they said. Ed Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington, said he was not bothered by Amazon's decision, which he said would give another city a chance to become a significant tech hub. ""I think there's no way to accommodate another 50,000 engineers and executives in Seattle,"" he said. ""I also don't think it would be healthy for Seattle to have that. As much as I love Amazon, to have that great a density of a single company, it means you're a one-horse town."""
5,2017-09-07," Good morning.  Here's what you need to know: • North Korea appears to be preparing for another ICBM launch. South Korea's prime minister says it's likely to be Saturday, the North's founding day holiday. Above, a mass celebration in Pyongyang this week honoring the scientists who carried out last Sunday's powerful nuclear test. The U.S. is pressing for a U.N. Security Council vote by Monday on tough, sweeping measures against the North, including an oil embargo, the authorization to board its ships, and a freeze on the assets of the leader, Kim Jong-un. President Vladimir Putin condemned the North's weapons tests after talks with Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, but Russia and China are likely to block the resolution. _____ • ""Every Florida family must prepare to evacuate."" That was Gov. Rick Scott as Hurricane Irma, now one of the most powerful storms ever recorded, left a path of devastation through the Caribbean and headed toward his state. The death toll — at least seven — is expected to rise. A local official said that ""95 percent"" of the island of St. Martin was destroyed. More than 70 percent of Puerto Rico households lost power. Here's a map of the storm's projected path. Our live briefing has the latest. _____ • It's been a severe season of storms and flooding around the world, and South Asia has seen some of the most devastating damage. More than 1,200 people have lost their lives in India, Nepal and Bangladesh — and the monsoon rains aren't over yet. Our correspondents went to northern India, where many people said they had no warning when the floodwaters started coursing last month. _____ • Guo Wengui, the Chinese billionaire who has accused some of Beijing's most powerful officials of corruption — making him arguably China's most-wanted man — has applied for political asylum in the U.S. That's a diplomatic quandary for the Trump administration, which wants China's aid in isolating North Korea. It's no help that, aside from President Trump himself, it remains unclear who in the administration wields genuine influence on the relationship with Beijing. _____ • Evidence of Russia's efforts to influence the U.S. presidential election is building. Facebook revealed that Russians are suspected of using fake accounts to buy and circulate divisive ads during the presidential campaign. And an investigation by The New York Times, along with new cybersecurity research, reveals some of the mechanisms Russian operators may have used to spread anti-Hillary Clinton messages on social media. Meanwhile, Donald Trump Jr. told Senate investigators that his concerns about Mrs. Clinton's ""fitness"" to be president prompted him to set up a June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer he believed had damaging information on her. _____ • Australia's fierce national debate over same-sex marriage resumed swiftly after the High Court threw out challenges to the contentious postal vote on the issue, which will cost about $97 million. ""The rights of any group of Australians being subject to a public vote sends a terrible message to our community,"" a rights advocate said.

0,2017-09-08," GODZILLA VERSUS MOTHRA: James Patterson's latest diversion, ""The Store,"" is about a mass-market behemoth standing astride the globe, anticipating and manipulating customers' desires in a bid for total cultural domination. Surprisingly, it is not an autobiography. The store of the title is an Amazon-like tech company with management anger issues, which reacts murderously when it discovers that a couple of married employees plan a tell-all book. If nothing else, it will leave you questioning the wisdom of drone delivery. Patterson versus Amazon feels a little like Godzilla versus Mothra, and the novel (written with Richard DiLallo) is doing predictably well; after three weeks, it's at No. 4 on the hardcover fiction list. Readers familiar with the book business may wonder whether Patterson — whose publisher, Little, Brown & Company, had a protracted and public feud with Amazon a few years ago — is exacting revenge here, but they'll have to draw their own conclusions. When Patterson was asked about his choice of villains last month on the public radio show ""Marketplace,"" he deflected the question with impressive dexterity for the engineer of runaway narrative locomotives like the Alex Cross series. Still, his allegiance was clear. ""I'm not maligning a big, fat bookstore,"" Patterson said. ""I'm maligning the idea of monopolies in the country. And in particular, I think it's a problem when it threatens publishing, because I think that books are really important in our lives, especially books that we can't live without. And I think right now the people that are best equipped to put out serious books are publishers. That may evolve over time, but right now publishers are pretty good at finding those books and paying to have them done and making sure that people are aware that they exist."" MACHINE DREAMS: If Patterson takes a bleak view of technology and its Big Brother implications, the physicist Max Tegmark is more cautiously optimistic in ""Life 3.0,"" new on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 11. Tegmark is a professor at M.I.T. and the president of the Future of Life Institute; in a recent interview with the website The Verge, he discussed the potential benefits of artificial intelligence: ""If you care about poverty, social justice, climate change, disease — all of these problems stump us because we're not smart enough to figure out how to solve them, but if we can amplify our own intelligence with machine intelligence, far beyond ours, we have an incredible potential to do better."""
1,2017-09-08," Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here's the sign-up.) In a typical year, San Diego County might see a few dozen cases of hepatitis A. So far this year? More than 400, with 15 people now killed by the liver disease. ""This is an outbreak like none other that we've ever had,"" said Dr. Wilma Wooten, the region's public health officer. Dr. Wooten said the response has been complicated by the infection's nebulous spread. Whereas past outbreaks have commonly been traced to a single food source, allowing the threat to be swiftly contained, this one is passing person to person. San Diego's homeless population has been hit hardest by the virus, which stalks its victims more readily in areas of poor sanitation. Another outbreak has unfolded among the homeless population in Santa Cruz County, where public health officials have confirmed 67 cases since April. Across the country, there have been reported spikes in Michigan and Colorado. But none on the scale of San Diego. Highly contagious, hepatitis A causes symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and jaundice. It's treatable, but can knock a victim out for weeks. San Diego health workers have been trying to slow its spread since March, when an uptick in cases was detected. More than 19,000 people have gotten the first of two immunization shots, administered six months apart. Still, cases have continued to emerge, said Dr. Wooten. County officials were sufficiently alarmed this month to declare a health emergency. Critics have accused the city and county of a lack of urgency in addressing the crisis. Besides vaccination, temporary hand-washing stations help provide a defense against the virus's spread. Yet by last week, only two had been set up on city streets, according to a report in the The Voice of San Diego. (Dozens more have since been added, Dr. Wooten said.) ""In hindsight you can always say, 'Could we do more?'"" said Greg Cox, a San Diego County supervisor. ""I'm not happy that it took so long to get the hand-washing stations out there. But the real key — the best prevention — is going to be the vaccinations."" Mr. Cox said the crisis represented a wake up call on the plight of San Diego's homeless. ""Clearly there's a relationship,"" he said. ""And we really need to get to the root cause of this hep A crisis in San Diego, which is really related to the homeless crisis.""

A divorced mother of five living in 19th-century San Jose, she resolved to practice law. But at the time, only white men were allowed to do so. So she drafted the ""Woman Lawyer's Bill"" and convinced a state lawmaker to introduce it. The measure prevailed over the warnings of opponents that a woman's ""seductive"" ways would sway juries. Later, Ms. Foltz was said to have charged uninvited into Gov. William Irwin's office and pleaded with him to sign the bill. He did. It was this week in 1878 that Ms. Foltz passed the bar exam, making her California's first female lawyer. She became a successful trial lawyer and a towering figure in the women's movement, said Barbara Babcock, a professor emeritus of law at Stanford who wrote a biography of Ms. Foltz. ""Sometimes she would be the only woman in the courtroom and talking to this all-male jury. It's a wonderful scene I think,"" she said. Every move Ms. Foltz made, it seemed, resulted in another milestone. She sued Hastings College of Law in San Francisco to compel it to allow women, and won. She pioneered the idea of the public defender. She became the first woman to serve as clerk of the state Assembly's judiciary committee, the first woman deputy district attorney in the United States and the first woman appointed to the state board of corrections. After practicing law for five decades, Ms. Foltz died in 1934 at the age of 85. In 2002, Los Angeles's Criminal Courts Building was renamed in her honor. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was there for the ceremony. ""She was really the pioneer for women lawyers,"" Justice O'Connor said, according to The Los Angeles Times.

Where would be the patriotic place for Amazon to put its enormous new office complex? The company announced yesterday that it was looking beyond Seattle to build a second headquarters. Ultimately, HQ2, as Amazon calls the project, will house up to 50,000 workers and stretch over more office space than the Pentagon. Amazon welcomed proposals from cities and said it wanted a metro area with at least 1 million people that employees would find appealing. As I read about the project, I realized that I already had a rooting interest. I hope Amazon has enough sense of corporate citizenship — and patriotism — to choose a place that helps the country. The United States is terribly polarized between its biggest cities and everywhere else. Large metropolitan areas on the coasts, like Seattle, San Francisco, Boston, New York and Washington, are thriving economically. The rest of the country isn't doing nearly so well. This gap aggravates all kinds of problems, including inequality and political polarization. It'd be a shame if Amazon, which will be showering jobs on a region, further exacerbated the gap with its choice.

3,2017-09-08," GODZILLA VERSUS MOTHRA: James Patterson's latest diversion, ""The Store,"" is about a mass-market behemoth standing astride the globe, anticipating and manipulating customers' desires in a bid for total cultural domination. Surprisingly, it is not an autobiography. The store of the title is an Amazon-like tech company with management anger issues, which reacts murderously when it discovers that a couple of married employees plan a tell-all book. If nothing else, it will leave you questioning the wisdom of drone delivery. Patterson versus Amazon feels a little like Godzilla versus Mothra, and the novel (written with Richard DiLallo) is doing predictably well; after three weeks, it's at No. 4 on the hardcover fiction list. Readers familiar with the book business may wonder whether Patterson — whose publisher, Little, Brown & Company, had a protracted and public feud with Amazon a few years ago — is exacting revenge here, but they'll have to draw their own conclusions. When Patterson was asked about his choice of villains last month on the public radio show ""Marketplace,"" he deflected the question with impressive dexterity for the engineer of runaway narrative locomotives like the Alex Cross series. Still, his allegiance was clear. ""I'm not maligning a big, fat bookstore,"" Patterson said. ""I'm maligning the idea of monopolies in the country. And in particular, I think it's a problem when it threatens publishing, because I think that books are really important in our lives, especially books that we can't live without. And I think right now the people that are best equipped to put out serious books are publishers. That may evolve over time, but right now publishers are pretty good at finding those books and paying to have them done and making sure that people are aware that they exist."" MACHINE DREAMS: If Patterson takes a bleak view of technology and its Big Brother implications, the physicist Max Tegmark is more cautiously optimistic in ""Life 3.0,"" new on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 11. Tegmark is a professor at M.I.T. and the president of the Future of Life Institute; in a recent interview with the website The Verge, he discussed the potential benefits of artificial intelligence: ""If you care about poverty, social justice, climate change, disease — all of these problems stump us because we're not smart enough to figure out how to solve them, but if we can amplify our own intelligence with machine intelligence, far beyond ours, we have an incredible potential to do better."""
4,2017-09-08," Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here's the sign-up.) In a typical year, San Diego County might see a few dozen cases of hepatitis A. So far this year? More than 400, with 15 people now killed by the liver disease. ""This is an outbreak like none other that we've ever had,"" said Dr. Wilma Wooten, the region's public health officer. Dr. Wooten said the response has been complicated by the infection's nebulous spread. Whereas past outbreaks have commonly been traced to a single food source, allowing the threat to be swiftly contained, this one is passing person to person. San Diego's homeless population has been hit hardest by the virus, which stalks its victims more readily in areas of poor sanitation. Another outbreak has unfolded among the homeless population in Santa Cruz County, where public health officials have confirmed 67 cases since April. Across the country, there have been reported spikes in Michigan and Colorado. But none on the scale of San Diego. Highly contagious, hepatitis A causes symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and jaundice. It's treatable, but can knock a victim out for weeks. San Diego health workers have been trying to slow its spread since March, when an uptick in cases was detected. More than 19,000 people have gotten the first of two immunization shots, administered six months apart. Still, cases have continued to emerge, said Dr. Wooten. County officials were sufficiently alarmed this month to declare a health emergency. Critics have accused the city and county of a lack of urgency in addressing the crisis. Besides vaccination, temporary hand-washing stations help provide a defense against the virus's spread. Yet by last week, only two had been set up on city streets, according to a report in the The Voice of San Diego. (Dozens more have since been added, Dr. Wooten said.) ""In hindsight you can always say, 'Could we do more?'"" said Greg Cox, a San Diego County supervisor. ""I'm not happy that it took so long to get the hand-washing stations out there. But the real key — the best prevention — is going to be the vaccinations."" Mr. Cox said the crisis represented a wake up call on the plight of San Diego's homeless. ""Clearly there's a relationship,"" he said. ""And we really need to get to the root cause of this hep A crisis in San Diego, which is really related to the homeless crisis.""

A divorced mother of five living in 19th-century San Jose, she resolved to practice law. But at the time, only white men were allowed to do so. So she drafted the ""Woman Lawyer's Bill"" and convinced a state lawmaker to introduce it. The measure prevailed over the warnings of opponents that a woman's ""seductive"" ways would sway juries. Later, Ms. Foltz was said to have charged uninvited into Gov. William Irwin's office and pleaded with him to sign the bill. He did. It was this week in 1878 that Ms. Foltz passed the bar exam, making her California's first female lawyer. She became a successful trial lawyer and a towering figure in the women's movement, said Barbara Babcock, a professor emeritus of law at Stanford who wrote a biography of Ms. Foltz. ""Sometimes she would be the only woman in the courtroom and talking to this all-male jury. It's a wonderful scene I think,"" she said. Every move Ms. Foltz made, it seemed, resulted in another milestone. She sued Hastings College of Law in San Francisco to compel it to allow women, and won. She pioneered the idea of the public defender. She became the first woman to serve as clerk of the state Assembly's judiciary committee, the first woman deputy district attorney in the United States and the first woman appointed to the state board of corrections. After practicing law for five decades, Ms. Foltz died in 1934 at the age of 85. In 2002, Los Angeles's Criminal Courts Building was renamed in her honor. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was there for the ceremony. ""She was really the pioneer for women lawyers,"" Justice O'Connor said, according to The Los Angeles Times.

1,2017-09-09," Earlier this week, a couple in Colorado filed a class-action lawsuit against an eyewear chain they say gave them faulty eclipse glasses. Watching the moon's spectacular crossing of the sun on Aug. 21 left them with distorted vision, according to their lawyer. A couple in South Carolina filed a similar lawsuit against Amazon in late August. Tens of millions of eclipse glasses were sold ahead of the first total solar eclipse to cross the United States in nearly a century. And though no one has an exact tally, it's clear that a significant portion were unreliable. Along with Amazon's massive recall, there was the coffee chain that stopped trusting glasses gifted with lattes and the medical center that scrambled to locate shades distributed at the county fair. Even optometrists were getting duped. ""I found counterfeits in a country store in a small town in New Hampshire,"" said Rick Fienberg, a press officer at the American Astronomical Society who became a sort of glasses safety referee in the weeks leading up to the eclipse. ""If they reached there, they reached everywhere."" Astronomers could chart the trajectory of the moon's shadow across the Earth, but somehow modern commerce could not deliver trustworthy eclipse glasses. How had a celebration of science devolved into a shady shades debacle? As I neared my eclipse-watching location in Excelsior Springs, Mo., a town of 11,000 along the line of totality, I spotted a path toward possible answers: ""ATTENTION DO NOT USE OUR GLASSES,"" a sign declared. It was unclear who ""our"" referred to, as the space above was eerily blank and Rod's, the building behind the sign, was boarded up. Perhaps if I found the author of the warning, and followed the supply chain, I could find at least one person to blame for the inescapable, joy-killing sense that no matter where we bought our glasses, our retinas were about to be toast. A few hours before totality, a man at a nearby carwash pointed me through a suds-filled tunnel toward an auto repair shop. Veronique Ford, a clerk at the family-owned EZ Quick Lube, confirmed the glasses cited in the sign were theirs. They sold around 800 at three to five dollars each. Pasted to the counter, was an email from the man who sold them the glasses, which included what looked like a certification number. But then a customer called. The ""score"" was not right. ""Now we're like, how do we know if he's telling the truth or not?"" said Mrs. Ford's boss, Carol Bishop, noting that the vendor had previously provided them with branded shirts. I called the company, Spirit Pack, that had sold EZ Quick Lube the glasses. None of the employees were willing to be quoted, but one told me that he had picked the manufacturer from a directory called DistributorCentral. The listing promised ""our ISO 12312-2 certified eclipse glasses are independently tested for safe solar viewing."" A Spirit Pack employee checked the certificate that had come with the glasses and saw it did not match the ad, instead listing a certificate number of 12312-1. When he followed up with the vendor, Global Promos Service, a woman told him that the glasses were safe. It was just an older certification. He said he believed her. But the problem was not about old certificates, it was about ineffective protection from sun exposure. And this is the part where we have to talk about federal regulations specific to eclipse glasses. In fact, there are none. Many sellers of glasses for the Great American Eclipse turned, voluntarily, to the guidelines offered by the International Organization for Standardization, known as ISO. Some government agencies, primarily in Europe, use the Geneva-based organization's standards to regulate imports and sales. When Global Promos Service, or anyone else, advertised an ISO certification of 12312-2, the companies were promising that the product met requirements outlined by Dr. B. Ralph Chou, an optometrist and the president of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. Glasses claiming an ISO certification of 12312-2 transmit ""less than 0.003 percent of the incident light"" so as to safely allow direct viewing of the sun, Dr. Chou said. Filters with the 12312-1 certification are intended for sunglasses and generally transmit ""no less than 15 percent of incident light."" It's the difference between 0.003 percent and 15 percent that had many worried the week before the eclipse. While a quick glance at the sun through 12312-1 glasses might be O.K., ""extended exposures through such tinted lenses could result in solar retinopathy,"" said Dr. Chou. Global Promos Service, the next link in the glasses chain, was listed in Los Angeles, also home to an active amateur astronomy community. Since I was there, I decided to meet with another vendor, Manish Panjwani, the owner of Agena AstroProducts. Like Mrs. Bishop of EZ Quick Lube, improperly certified shades hurt his credibility. In his case, though, the problematic products were not his. Several weeks before the eclipse, as reports of suspicious glasses surfaced, ""Amazon took down virtually every storefront selling eclipse glasses, including ones from legitimate manufacturers and their authorized dealers,"" said Dr. Fienberg of the American Astronomical Society. The company then sent emails to many customers warning them that they may have received eclipse glasses that couldn't be verified as safe. One of these authorized dealers was Mr. Panjwani, who was listed on the American Astronomical Society's reputable vendors list. Mr. Panjwani sold around 30,000 eclipse glasses through Amazon. At a time of peak sales, he had the ""buy box"" for glasses made by the German company Baader Planetarium. That meant that when a customer pressed ""add to cart"" on the Baader glasses, above, he was the seller. But when customers clicked on a cheaper price for the same product, they sometimes got something else entirely from another vendor – like the glasses below: When Amazon issued its recall, the company yanked the entire product page, and sent emails to Mr. Panjwani's customers as well, even though they had received legitimate Baader glasses. In a statement to The New York Times, an Amazon spokesman said: ""Out of an abundance of caution and in the interests of our customers, we asked third-party sellers that were offering solar eclipse glasses to provide documentation to verify their products were compliant with relevant safety standards. After reviewing the documentation, the offers from sellers with compliant eclipse glasses remained available to customers. The listings from sellers who were not approved were removed and customers who purchased from them were notified."" Mr. Panjwani said he submitted proper documentation three times. He said that Amazon did reinstate the page, only to pull it again, and then reinstate it again, leaving him with an inbox full of confused and angry emails. ""Amazon could have addressed it earlier and more carefully instead of making everyone into a bad guy and freaking out the country out in the process,"" he said. Dr. Fienberg of the American Astronomical Society agreed that Amazon exacerbated confusion by failing to vet eclipse products earlier. Initially he estimated that the recall cost legitimate vendors millions in profits. In a statement to The Times, Amazon said the company would cover the cost of refunds for sellers with proper certification. This includes Agena AstroProducts. ""I think 2024 will be very different,"" said Dr. Fienberg, referring to the next total eclipse to cross the United States. But for Steven W. Teppler of the Abbott Law Group, who is co-lead counsel in the two eclipse glasses lawsuits, the issue is much broader. If one cannot trust an Amazon listing, he said, ""What comfort can you get from the representation of anything you buy online?"" As Mr. Panjwani, observed, the fraudsters are not going away. Even so, their motivations are a mystery to him: ""Why would you risk bodily harm and injury to someone else for so little profit?"" I was hoping to ask this question to the people at Global Promos Service. As I parked near their address in Los Angeles, I knew that Spirit Pack's main contact, Fiona Rjrr as her name appeared in email, was in China that week. She'd told me this in an exchange, which ended when I clarified that I was a reporter from The New York Times, not a buyer of eclipse glasses. Certainly there would be someone else to take my questions. Except there wasn't. Because the address, as listed in the Distributor Central directory, did not exist. I pulled up the company website, which offered an address that was one digit different. Aha — so it was just a typo. Except the suite was vacant. I emailed Ms. Rjrr — and no, that is probably not her last name — for clarification about whether there was another office somewhere in California. ""Sorry, I have no comment to make,"" she responded. Why use a fake address? Kieron Norris, an operations director at the risk management company Pinkerton, said having the appearance of a physical location in the United States can build trust to boost sales. He also pointed out that there is little incentive for a Chinese manufacturer to go through the expensive, time-consuming process of getting certification for a rare event, even if the product could pass the test. In fact, one dealer that did product testing on suspicious eclipse glasses manufactured in China found that they were safe, but ""one actually failed to comply with ISO 12312-2 because its filters were too dark!"" said Dr. Fienberg over email. I called Ms. Ford of EZ Quick Lube to share my findings. A longtime Republican, skeptical of government regulation, she said that the experience reminded her of its occasional value. ""You've got to have boundaries or there is chaos,"" she observed. But she could not identify a clear villain. ""We trusted someone else who in turned trusted someone else,"" she concluded, ""so I think there is some fault in each step."""
0,2017-09-10," SÃO PAULO, Brazil — They were members of an uncontacted tribe gathering eggs along the river in a remote part of the Amazon. Then, it appears, they had the bad luck of running into gold miners. Now, federal prosecutors in Brazil have opened an investigation into the reported massacre of about 10 members of the tribe, the latest evidence that threats to endangered indigenous groups are on the rise in the country. The Brazilian agency on indigenous affairs, Funai, said it had lodged a complaint with the prosecutor's office in the state of Amazonas after the gold miners went to a bar near the border with Colombia, and bragged about the killings. They brandished a hand-carved paddle that they said had come from the tribe, the agency said. ""It was crude bar talk,"" said Leila Silvia Burger Sotto-Maior, Funai's coordinator for uncontacted and recently contacted tribes. ""They even bragged about cutting up the bodies and throwing them in the river."" The miners, she said, claimed that ""they had to kill them or be killed."" Ms. Sotto-Maior said the killings were reported to have taken place last month. The indigenous affairs bureau conducted some initial interviews in the town and then took the case to the police. ""There is a lot of evidence, but it needs to be proven,"" she said. The prosecutor in charge of the case, Pablo Luz de Beltrand, confirmed that an investigation had begun, but said he could not discuss the details of the case while it was underway. He said the episode was alleged to have occurred in the Javari Valley — the second-largest indigenous reserve in Brazil — in the remote west. ""We are following up, but the territories are big and access is limited,"" Mr. Beltrand said. ""These tribes are uncontacted — even Funai has only sporadic information about them. So it's difficult work that requires all government departments working together."" Mr. Beltrand said it was the second such episode that he was investigating this year. The first reported killing of uncontacted indigenous people in the region occurred in February, and that case is still open. ""It was the first time that we'd had this kind of case in this region,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""It's not something that was happening before."" Survival International, a global indigenous rights group, warned that given the small sizes of the uncontacted Amazon tribes, this latest episode could mean that a significant percentage of a remote ethnic group was wiped out. ""If the investigation confirms the reports, it will be yet another genocidal massacre resulting directly from the Brazilian government's failure to protect isolated tribes — something that is guaranteed in the Constitution,"" said Sarah Shenker, a senior campaigner with the rights group. Under Brazil's president, Michel Temer, funding for indigenous affairs has been slashed. In April, Funai closed five of the 19 bases that it uses to monitor and protect isolated tribes, and reduced staffing at others. The bases are used to prevent invasions by loggers and miners and to communicate with recently contacted tribes. Three of those bases were in the Javari Valley, which is known as the Uncontacted Frontier and is believed to be home to more uncontacted tribes than anywhere else on Earth. Approximately 20 of the 103 uncontacted tribes registered in Brazil are in the Valley. ""We had problems with previous governments, but not like this,"" said Ms. Sotto-Maior, the Funai coordinator. Her agency's budget this year for the uncontacted tribes department was just two million reais, or about $650,000, down from 7.5 million reais in 2014. ""What can I do with two million reais?"" she said. President Temer, who is deeply unpopular, has sought support from powerful agricultural, ranching and mining lobbies to push economic changes through Congress and shelter him from a corruption investigation. Last month, the lower house of Congress voted to spare him from standing trial for corruption in the Supreme Court, but only after the president doled out jobs and agreed to a series of concessions, many of which affected longstanding deforestation and land-rights regulations. A decree by Mr. Temer that opened up a large reserve in the Amazon to mining prompted an international outcry. After a judge blocked the decree, the government announced that it would revise its decision, but critics are wary. With land disputes on the rise in many remote areas of Brazil, indigenous groups, rural workers and land activists have all been targeted by violence. More than 50 people had been killed as of the end of July, compared with 61 in all of 2016, according to the Land Pastoral Commission. In some cases, government or police agents have been blamed for the violence. The authorities are investigating one police raid in the Amazon region that ended with 10 activists being killed. No officers were injured. Activists worry that the country's indigenous groups — and especially the uncontacted tribes — are the most vulnerable when it comes to land disputes. ""When their land is protected, they thrive,"" said Ms. Shenker, the rights campaigner. ""When their land is invaded, they can be wiped out."""

2,2017-09-10," FLORENCE, N.J. — Nissa Scott started working at the cavernous Amazon warehouse in southern New Jersey late last year, stacking plastic bins the size of small ottomans. It was not, she says, the most stimulating activity. And lifting the bins, which often weigh 25 pounds each, was also tiring over 10-hour shifts. Now Ms. Scott, 21, watches her replacement — a giant, bright yellow mechanical arm — do the stacking. Her new job at Amazon is to babysit several robots at a time, troubleshooting them when necessary and making sure they have bins to load. On a recent afternoon, a claw at end of the arm grabbed a bin off a conveyor belt and stacked it on another bin, forming neat columns on wooden pallets surrounding the robot. It was the first time Amazon had shown the arm, the latest generation of robots in use at its warehouses, to a reporter. ""For me, it's the most mentally challenging thing we have here,"" Ms. Scott said of her new job. ""It's not repetitive."" Perhaps no company embodies the anxieties and hopes around automation better than Amazon. Many people, including President Trump, blame the company for destroying traditional retail jobs by enticing people to shop online. At the same time, the company's eye-popping growth has turned it into a hiring machine, with an unquenchable need for entry-level warehouse workers to satisfy customer orders. Amazon's global work force is three times larger than Microsoft's and 18 times larger than Facebook's, and last week, Amazon said it would open a second headquarters in North America with up to 50,000 new jobs. Complicating the equation even more, Amazon is also on the forefront of automation, finding new ways of getting robots to do the work once handled by employees. In 2014, the company began rolling out robots to its warehouses using machines originally developed by Kiva Systems, a company Amazon bought for $775 million two years earlier and renamed Amazon Robotics. Amazon now has more than 100,000 robots in action around the world, and it has plans to add many more to the mix. The robots make warehouse work less tedious and physically taxing, while also enabling the kinds of efficiency gains that let a customer order dental floss after breakfast and receive it before dinner. ""It's certainly true that Amazon would not be able to operate at the costs they have and the costs they provide customers without this automation,"" said Martin Ford, a futurist and author of ""Rise of the Robots,"" a book about automation. ""Maybe we wouldn't be getting two-day shipping."" The dynamics between people and machines play out on a daily basis on the floor of Amazon warehouses in places like Florence, N.J., and Kent, Wash. In Kent, the robots vaguely resemble giant beetles and scurry around with vertical shelves loaded with merchandise weighing up to 3,000 pounds on their backs. Hundreds of them move autonomously inside a large caged area, tailgating each other but not colliding. On one edge of the cage, a group of human workers — the ""stowers"" — stuff products onto the shelves, replenishing their inventory. The robots whisk those shelves away and when a customer order arrives for products stored on their backs, they queue up at stations on another edge of the cage like cars waiting to go through a toll both. There, human ""pickers"" follow instructions on computer screens, grabbing items off the shelves and putting them in plastic bins, which then disappear on conveyor belts destined for ""packers,"" people who put the products in cardboard boxes bound for customers. Dave Clark, the top executive in charge of operations at Amazon, said the company wanted the machines to perform the most monotonous tasks, leaving people to do jobs that engage them mentally. ""It's a new item each time,"" Mr. Clark said. ""You're finding something, you're inspecting things, you're engaging your mind in a way that I think is important."" The robots also cut down on the walking required of workers, making Amazon pickers more efficient and less tired. The robots also allow Amazon to pack shelves together like cars in rush-hour traffic, because they no longer need aisle space for humans. The greater density of shelf space means more inventory under one roof, which means better selection for customers. The Amazon warehouse in Florence shows the latest example of the kinds of jobs machines can do better than people. Eight mechanical arms are in operation at the facility, a warehouse where large quantities of merchandise are broken down into smaller units and distributed to Amazon fulfillment centers across the country. The arms go by the awkward name of robotic palletizers, but workers have given them a dash of personality, sticking signs on each one naming them after Stuart, Dave and other minion characters from the ""Despicable Me"" movies. Unlike the warehouse robots in Kent, which were based on the machines Amazon got through its Kiva acquisition, these arms come from an outside company. Amazon began installing them late last year, not long after it opened the warehouse in Florence. The robot arm is configured to pick up only bins of a standard size, not objects of other dimensions. In a demonstration of future possibilities, Amazon showed a virtual reality simulation used to prototype new robot concepts, including an arm with a forklift attachment that moved pallets. When Amazon installed the robots, some people who had stacked bins before, like Ms. Scott, took courses at the company to become robot operators. Many others moved to receiving stations, where they manually sort big boxes of merchandise into bins. No people were laid off when the robots were installed, and Amazon found new roles for the displaced workers, Mr. Clark said. ""The people didn't go anywhere,"" he said. The question going forward is: What happens when the future generations of robots arrive? For now, there are warehouse tasks — for example, picking individual items off shelves, with all their various shapes and sizes — where people outperform robots. Amazon has added 80,000 warehouse employees in the United States since adding the Kiva robots, for a total of more than 125,000 warehouse employees. And it says the warehouse hiring spree will continue. But start-ups and researchers are scrambling to overcome the many remaining technical obstacles. Amazon even sponsors an annual contest to encourage more innovation in the category. Mr. Ford, the author, believes it is just a matter of time before the employment picture in Amazon's warehouses changes. ""My assumption is this technology will eventually displace a lot of people in those warehouses,"" Mr. Ford said. ""I would not say that overnight huge numbers of jobs disappear. Maybe the first indication is they don't get rid of those people but the pace of job creation slows down."" Amazon's Mr. Clark said history showed that automation increases productivity and, in some cases, demand from consumers, which ultimately creates more jobs. He said warehouse workers would continue to work in technologically rich environments. ""It's a myth that automation destroys net job growth,"" he said. In the case of the Florence facility, it opened up the new opportunity for Ms. Scott. At one point, one of the arms knocked over a tote, sending a dozen or so cone-shaped plastic coffee filters skidding across the ground. Ms. Scott hit a button that froze the arm so she could safely pick up the mess. Then the arms started working again. ""The robot will work the same all day long,"" said Edward Cohoon, who supervises Ms. Scott and other Amazon workers as they tend to individual robots. ""Their stomachs don't grumble."""
0,2017-09-11," For an independent designer operating in a world of megabrands like Amazon, Zara, Nike and H&M, an old maxim may hold the key to survival: United we are stronger. At least that was the thinking Elizabeth Solomeina applied when she was struggling to find a way to show and sell the jewelry she designs without spending huge amounts of money on rent or outsourcing her work to various boutiques. ""I needed a place to sell my stuff, I needed a customer base,"" Ms. Solomeina said. ""When stylists wanted to come over to my studio, I would tell them it's in Brooklyn, and they would be like, 'Never mind.'"" ""I wasn't alone,"" she said. ""I had friends like this, too."" So in the summer of 2016, she gathered 34 of them and together they pitched in funds to open a boutique called Flying Solo on Mulberry Street in NoLIta. Within three months, the group had expanded to 45 designers. In June of this year, it grew again, adding more than 20 to the roster and moving to a two-floor shop on West Broadway, on the same block as Missoni, Aesop and DKNY. Last Friday, during New York Fashion Week, the group of 68 held a two-hour-long presentation and runway show in the store, displaying more than 350 looks. During the presentation, models in neutral colors showed off jewelry and accessories, rotating every few minutes. The runway show included a variety of aesthetic visions. Most of the pieces were the kind you could walk out onto the street wearing, and all were available immediately after the show. As techno beats and songs by Little Dragon, Migos and Sango pounded through the speakers, models strutted by in metallic and brightly colored pants and jackets (from Daniel Silverstain, who has designed for Solange and Lady Gaga); long coats with ""Proud Immigrant"" written across the back (from Ricardo Seco, a Mexican designer); tweed suits and knit dresses (from Kathrin Henon, who works with Dennis Basso); and much more. Between each section of the show, models in silver pants and Flying Solo T-shirts created by the designers walked by with signs denoting the next designer's Instagram handle. Flying Solo operates somewhat like a grocery or building co-op, with members paying a membership fee that goes toward rent, production and marketing costs for events like the fashion week show. Each member is required to work eight hours every week, opening and closing the store, cleaning and helping customers on the floor. When the team members opened their first store on Mulberry Street, they put together as much of the interior themselves as they could. ""We designed the racks, the shelving,"" Ms. Solomeina said. ""Our designers were sketching, running to Home Depot, assembling racks."" They were ready for customers in three days. On West Broadway, it took all of four. ""It's our sweat and I hope no tears,"" Ms. Solomeina said. Flying Solo has had help from outside. Early on, Ms. Solomeina secured funding from Alex Barnett, an investor who has worked with technology companies and charities. Mr. Barnett saw in Ms. Solomeina's proposal a model for the future. ""A lot of them are really brilliant designers,"" he said of Flying Solo's members. ""It's a tragedy that the brilliance isn't rewarded. A lot of times it's who has a lot of capital or who gets picked up by a big brand or whatever the trend is at that moment."" Speaking of the changes in the retail landscape that have been spurred by the advent of technology and the expansion of giants like Amazon, Zara and H&M, Mr. Barnett said: ""I don't think change should be feared. It's creating space for innovation. Independent designers need to stop working against each other and realize they're all on the same side."""
0,2017-09-13," In the new season of Tig Notaro's Amazon series, ""One Mississippi,"" a progressive radio station programmer dogged by rumors of sexual misconduct invites a female employee to his office for a meeting, where he masturbates behind the desk while she talks. If this scene evokes internet rumors about Louis C.K. — an executive producer of ""One Mississippi"" — it's because a recent interview with Ms. Notaro encourages that reading. She said that he now has nothing to do with the series and that he ""should handle"" the accusations, which had been reported by Gawker and singled out by Roseanne Barr. ""One Mississippi"" went online on Friday; the next day ""I Love You, Daddy,"" a new movie starring and directed by Louis C.K., had its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. Reportedly a comedy that digs into the question of how to approach gossip about the sexual transgressions of star artists (Woody Allen, say), the film suggests the lane that Louis C.K. prefers. In the past week, a debate about rumors has moved to the battlefield of art, pitting two of the greatest stand-up comedians working today against each other. [Asking Questions Louis C.K. Doesn't Want to Answer] ""One Mississippi"" is a nuanced, romantic and charmingly drawn series, a moseying six-episode slice of life that occasionally detours down dark alleys. It's a marvelously layered show centering on a series of unlikely relationships, in which the laughs come from character details more than punch lines. Ms. Notaro is no polemicist, but in the second season, she has married her deadpan sensibility to a work that expresses a strong point of view on sexual assault: The justice system is stacked against victims, and our culture more broadly has become too blasé about widespread harassment. The feat of the show is the effortless way it blends the dark and the light, persuading you that narratives with comedy and tragedy side by side are the best reflection of the real world. Ms. Notaro, who plays a character named Tig, is often at odds with her love interest, Kate (her real-life wife, Stephanie Allynne), on how to think about sexual misconduct. After Kate's experience with the radio programmer, she recalls, with mild disapproval, the inappropriate behavior of a coach in her high school days, and Ms. Notaro corrects her: ""By the way, you were molested."" Kate disagrees: ""But that happens to me all the time."" The show is most pointed when the two women try to find redress for the behavior of the radio programmer, Jack (Timm Sharp). In an echo of the way Louis C.K. championed Ms. Notaro after her seminal confessional set with its famous opening joke — ""Hello. Good evening. Hello. I have cancer. How are you?"" — the programmer tells Tig that he became obsessed with her work when she began doing ""deeper, darker more personal material."" But when she confronts him about masturbating, Jack denies any transgression, and when Kate and Tig approach his boss, they find him sympathetic but ineffectual. ""One Mississippi"" focuses on the trauma of being a victim, reflected in the way the masturbation scene is shot, shifting to a close-up of Kate's anguished face as Jack becomes a blur. ""We wanted to show that you can be assaulted without even being touched,"" Ms. Notaro told The Hollywood Reporter. This scene provides a contrast to a stunning episode of ""Girls"" last season, a portrait of sexual assault by a powerful man. After Hannah (Lena Dunham) writes about a novelist's sexual encounters with young women, the novelist, a divorced father played by Matthew Rhys, invites her to his apartment. He is seductive and argumentative and Hannah has already written about him, so their dynamic is complex and shifting. What Ms. Notaro portrays pointedly is not. In her show, the facts of the assault are simple, but the system for handling it is not. In a time when polarized debate over sexual assault often breaks down between those who say society needs to do more to protect victims and others who insist it must do better at respecting the due process of the accused, ""One Mississippi"" doesn't just take a side, it also skewers the weak spots of the opposing one. Louis C.K. usually seems less comfortable taking sides than jumping between them. In his controversial monologue on ""Saturday Night Live"" in 2015, he invited audiences to understand the pedophile's point of view. To be clear, he wasn't defending pedophiles, but his comedy is dialectical, finding its perspective through debate, juxtaposition and satire. When he portrayed sexual assault on his FX series, ""Louie,"" he often seemed to be testing how far he could keep an audience's sympathies on the side of a sexual abuser. In a 2012 episode, a character played by Melissa Leo delivers a passionate attack on male double standards about sex before she rapes Louie, his sad-sack alter ego. In an episode last year, Louie drags his babysitter across the apartment trying to kiss her. It was an uncomfortable scene to watch. I have not seen ""I Love You, Daddy,"" but Louis C.K. told my colleague Cara Buckley that when it comes to the morality of beloved artists whose private lives are under clouds of scandal: ""The uncomfortable truth is, you never really know. You don't know anybody."" This speaks to an often ignored fact about stand-up comics who make art about characters named after themselves: Their work may draw on real life but can be as fictional as any other art form. In the same interview, Louis C.K. said he wouldn't respond to the allegations, explaining, ""If you actually participate in a rumor, you make it bigger and you make it real."" When asked if the rumor wasn't real, he responded, ""No. They're rumors, that's all that is."" Yet Louis C.K.'s slightly evasive response stands out precisely because he has long won fans over by being so open about his private side, in his work and in interviews. (On Marc Maron's podcast, he talked bluntly about dealing with sexually compulsive behavior and using masturbation to handle anxiety.) Being open about his flaws, sexual and otherwise, earned him sympathy and perhaps even set expectations. Now he says he wants to just speak about the work, even as his new film will inevitably invite discussion about his life. It's a tricky balancing act, especially when Ms. Notaro says she hopes her show inspires victims to speak out. Part of what makes the comedy of Louis C.K. and Ms. Notaro exciting is that they both often suggest they are giving us a peek at an actual life. But once you blur the lines between what's real and what is not, it can be difficult to bring the distinction between the two back into focus."
1,2017-09-13," How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Nick Wingfield, a technology reporter based in Seattle, discussed the tech he is using. You cover Amazon and Microsoft. Do you use their technology? The one technology constant in my career as a journalist seems to be Microsoft Word. I take notes for all of my stories in it on a MacBook Pro. I've tried Google Docs and OneNote, but can't stick with them for reasons I can't explain. I have a feeling I might be cremated with a copy of Microsoft Word. Like most people, I buy a lot of stuff on Amazon, and I've tried most of their gadgets. I used an Echo for a while. My family mainly used it to turn on a lamp through a WeMo light switch with our voices. My kids enjoyed asking Alexa to play scatological sound effects. I enjoyed that too, if I'm being honest. What do or don't you like about their tech products that you use? I find some of the things you can do on the Echo pretty silly and much easier on a smartphone app. I'll give you an example. A while back I was installing a sprinkler system in my garden that was connected to a wireless control unit. I found out I could use the control unit with Alexa to turn on the sprinklers with my voice. When I told Alexa to turn the sprinklers on, a geyser of water shot up six feet in the air from a pipe I hadn't properly secured. I yelled every Alexa command I could think of to turn it off, but apparently she didn't like my syntax, and the water kept gushing. I finally just opened the app for the sprinkler unit and turned it off. Also, most people have their sprinklers on timers so they don't need voice control. What are your favorite websites, apps or other tech tools for keeping on top of technology news? I get so much of my news diet, technology or otherwise, through Twitter and, to a lesser extent, Facebook. I have configured my phone to send me a text message every time Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, tweets because he'll occasionally make news that way. What tech gadgets or apps are you or your family currently obsessed with and why? Another reason I'm not the most avid Echo user is that I like the sound from my Sonos speaker system better. Roughly 70 percent of the time I'm using Sonos to stream KCRW's Eclectic24 music mix. The rest of the time, it's Spotify and KUOW, my local NPR station. I pay for a Spotify family plan, which keeps my daughter's playlists from contaminating my own and vice versa. I am a contrarian on the Apple Watch, which I believe has been unfairly maligned by tech pundits. I love mine, and I get pretty frustrated by a lot of Apple products. I'm a runner and cyclist and track all of my workouts with it. I use Siri on the watch to respond to text messages. Apple somehow managed to create a wearable device versatile enough that you can wear it on a run and with a suit. That's impressive. Are there technologies that you're not crazy about? I've never cared for reading books on screens, even though I almost exclusively read newspapers and magazines on my phone and computer. I'm also skeptical of most kitchen gadgetry. I bought an Anova sous vide wand, which cooks meat and other proteins at precise, low temperatures in water baths. In most cases, I feel the results aren't worth the effort. A cast iron pan is much cheaper, will never break and steaks taste better when prepared in one. You once wrote about taking your kids to a video game little league. What video games are you, or they, now heavily into? I don't play video games. My son does. I'm embarrassed to say he spent a decent chunk of the summer wasting bad guys in Call of Duty. He also read a big stack of books and is a sweet, sensitive kid, which is how he got away with it. What's your advice about how much or how little kids should be on their devices and on games?  This is such a difficult issue. Most of my daughter's homework is on a computer so policing her screen time is really about limiting certain applications or websites. The other day I gave her a hard time when I heard her listening to YouTube. It was for her Spanish class. Overall, I try to encourage personal responsibility rather than hassle my kids all the time about their devices. It has worked so far."

1,2017-09-15," Take that Amazon. Walmart is doubling down on its hometown of Bentonville, Ark. One week after Amazon announced, with great fanfare, that it is planning to build a second headquarters in a city offering the best perks, Walmart said on Friday that it is replacing its aging headquarters in Bentonville with a new one. In a note to employees on Friday, Walmart's chief executive, Doug McMillon, said the company's current corporate campus — a hodgepodge of more than 20 buildings spanning several communities — are ""significantly beyond their shelf life."" The new home office, centered on 350 acres, will be better suited to a more ""digitally native work force,"" he said. ""You'll see improved parking, meal services, fitness, and natural light — yes, natural light,"" Mr. McMillon wrote. Walmart's current office in Bentonville was built by the company's founder, Sam Walton, in 1971, but as the company has grown into the nation's largest private employer with 1.5 million workers in the United States, it has had to add buildings to house its many employees. The construction of the new headquarters, which will house up to 17,000 employees, will take place over the next five to seven years. Walmart has not yet calculated the cost. A Walmart spokesman said that when thinking about the need for a new headquarters, the company did not consider moving to another city. Walmart's loyalty to Bentonville contrasts with Amazon's decision to build a second headquarters outside its home office in Seattle, setting off a bidding war among American cities. The two companies have waged an increasingly fierce competition to dominate the retail industry. More than a dozen cities and states have already publicly expressed their interest in wooing Amazon to town, with some using stunts aimed at making their bids stand out from the fray. Southwestern Corridor, an economic development group for southern Arizona, this week loaded a 21-foot-tall Saguaro cactus onto a flatbed truck bound for Seattle and Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, to underscore Tucson's interest in bringing Amazon's second headquarters to the city. Meanwhile, the mayor of Washington, D.C., Muriel Bowser, posted a one-and-a-half minute video extolling the virtues of the nation's capital. The video included some product placement, including Amazon's Echo smart speaker and a copy of The Washington Post, which Mr. Bezos personally owns."
2,2017-09-15," Time has only increased interest among Canadians in the Avro Arrow supersonic fighter jet that was abruptly canceled by the government in 1959, putting at least 25,000 people out of work. While reporting recently on the hunt for Arrow relics in Lake Ontario, I asked why so many Canadians still care, or even know, about an unproven jet fighter that never entered military service. Many people suggested that Arrow mythology was based on what might have been. In concept, the Arrow was the most advanced airplane of its time. Had it been fully developed, many people told me, Canada would have become a major force in aviation. (Several Canadian companies, notably Bombardier and CAE, nevertheless grew into major international aerospace players.) But almost everyone I met also mentioned the government's campaign to seemingly wipe away all traces of the Arrow. The six complete planes and the partially built ones on the assembly line were cut into pieces and many of their blueprints were destroyed, as was the manufacturing machinery. The effort to erase the Arrow is usually attributed to John Diefenbaker, the volatile prime minister who canceled the program. But several historians pointed me to a meticulously researched graduate thesis paper on the Arrow by Russell Isinger, who is now the registrar at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon. In it, he clears Mr. Diefenbaker. Through military and government documents, he found that the complete planes were offered to aviation research organizations in Canada, the United States and Britain. All of them said, no, thanks, apparently because of the cost of keeping a small fleet of orphaned planes flying. The destruction that followed, Mr. Isinger found, was not ""not out of Diefenbaker's vindictiveness"" but was ""simply due to bureaucratic standard operating procedure."" Read: Hunting for a Canadian Legend: the Avro Arrow Jet Fighter Amazon, the online retail giant, is shopping. It wants to supplement its current head office with a second one somewhere else in North America. The location was not limited to the United States. That led several Canadian mayors to say that they plan to make bids to host the complex, which holds out the promise of 50,000 jobs and a $5 billion investment. My colleagues at The Upshot, who specialize in making sense of data, took Amazon's criteria and crunched the numbers to help the company with its selection. (Hint: the prospective winner is in a Western state with lots of altitude.) Canadian cities weren't included in the data sets available to The Upshot so Canada was excluded. But MountainMath, a data analysis company in Vancouver, British Columbia, picked up the task. Its Canadian winner is not one that comes up frequently in most speculation: Calgary, Alberta. The consensus in the Canadian news media is that the country shouldn't be counting its chickens. Read: Dear Amazon, We Picked Your New Headquarters for You Read: Amazon Plans Second Headquarters, Opening a Bidding War Among Cities Apple on Tuesday marked the 10th anniversary of the iPhone by unveiling three new phones (four if you count the Apple Watch that can make calls). By coincidence that same day, I came across a folder with material from when I interviewed Steve Jobs shortly before the first Macintosh computer was unveiled in 1984. (At the time, I worked for Maclean's magazine.) Apple product launches were certainly less slick back then. The key handout for the Mac was a four-page, black-and-white photocopy with crude graphics made with the new Mac. When we met, Mr. Jobs switched on the new computer and declared it to be ""insanely great."" The phrase ultimately became so associated with Mr. Jobs that it was the title of a recent graphic biography of his life by Jessie Hartland. But a spokeswoman sitting in during the interview on Jan. 12, 1984, would have nothing to do with that sentiment, interrupting Mr. Jobs to say: ""You don't want to be 'insanely great'."" Never modest, Mr. Jobs said that the Mac was as great an advance over other computers as the telephone was over the telegraph. Growing increasingly excited (according to my musty transcript), Mr. Jobs predicted that the Mac would give Apple sales of $10 billion by the end of the decade. That didn't pan out. In 1990 its sales were $5.5 billion. The company, of course, eventually far outstripped Mr. Jobs's dreams and reported sales last year of $215.6 billion. In 1984, growth worried Mr. Jobs as much as it excited him. He brought up Xerox, which developed some of the innovations that then surfaced in the first Mac. ""What happened as it became a multibillion-dollar corporation?"" Mr. Jobs asked. ""It lost its way somehow, it lost its culture, it lost its spirit and ultimately it lost the ability to attract and retain great people."" Keeping Apple from that fate, he suggested, required him to be a demanding boss. ""I really want to set an expectation of nothing short of great, and there are some people that are interested in doing adequate stuff,"" he said. ""Those people and I don't get along very well."" About a year later Mr. Jobs was ousted from Apple, and he didn't return until 1997.

0,2017-09-16," A couple of interesting things are happening with the massive companies that rule our online lives. First, the lords of Silicon Valley face political headwinds. There is tech-company skepticism on the populist right, the anti-corporate left and the good-government center. There is talk of trustbusting and utility-style regulation from Steve Bannon as well as Bernie Sanders. There is a palpable feeling, as Ben Smith of Buzzfeed wrote last week, that the online giants' ""golden age"" of political immunity is ending, and that it might be ""normal politics, normal regulation"" from here on out. Second, one of these giants — Amazon — is in the market for a second headquarters, where it intends to park some 50,000 employees and an awful lot of tech-industry dollars over the years and decades ahead. The Amazon hunt has inspired data whizzes to argue about which American metropolis best fits the company's demanding specifications. This newspaper's The Upshot, for instance, used indicators like job growth, an educated labor pool, quality of life and ease of transportation to winnow the list to Portland, Ore.; Denver; Boston; and D.C. — and then gave the edge to Denver for its space and lower cost of living. The company will probably ultimately make a choice along these lines. But the political backdrop, the growing suspicion on right and left about whether big tech serves the common good, raises an interesting question: What if Amazon treated their headquartering decision as an act of corporate citizenship, part public relations stunt and part genuinely patriotic gesture? What if it approached the decision as an opportunity to push back against trends driving populist suspicion of big business — educational and geographic polarization, coastal growth and heartland decay, the sense that the New Economy creates wealth but not jobs and that its tycoons are loyal to globalization rather than their country? Amazon can't realistically spread its offices and jobs across America's most isolated and despairing counties. But instead of picking an obvious BosWash hub or creative-class boomtown, it could opt to plant itself in a medium-sized city in a conservative state — think Nashville or Indianapolis or Birmingham. Or it could look for a struggling East Coast alternative to the obvious Acelaland options — not Boston but Hartford, not D.C. but Baltimore, not New York but Bridgeport. Or it could pick a big, battered, declining city and offer its presence as an engine of revitalization, building Amazon Cleveland or Amazon Detroit. A particularly compelling pick, according to my extremely nonscientific ""what's good for America"" metric, might be St. Louis — a once-great metropolis fallen on hard times, the major urban center for a large spread of Trump country, the geographic center of the country and the historic bridge between East and West. Of course, Amazon also needs its choice for a new headquarters to make financial sense. The company is not a charity, and making itself the prisoner of a disastrous investment won't ultimately help anyone except its rivals. But it's hard to know with any real certainty what the best long-term geographic investment for the company would be. The fact that tech companies tend to cluster doesn't mean that a uniquely rich and powerful company couldn't benefit from having a city of its own. The fact that bright young singletons gravitate toward coastal urbs right now doesn't mean that you couldn't attract talent — especially married-with-kids talent — to a heartland city whose Amazon District took advantage of sprawling housing stock left over from a prosperous past. Depending on which elements on Amazon's wish list you weight most heavily, you can make a great variety of cities score impressively — from Bridgeport to Provo, Utah; Detroit to Rochester, N.Y. Ultimately, as Lyman Stone, a prolific Department of Agriculture cotton economist, points out in a piece on Amazon's decision, there is no city that comes close to meeting all of the company's requirements: ""No matter where Amazon goes, they will have to build their own fundamentals."" And no matter where the company goes, what it builds will change that city radically — so a static analysis of any destination will only take you so far. If Donald Trump were the deal making, industrial-policy president that he once promised to be, he would be on the phone with Jeff Bezos right now, making a case along these very lines — while hinting, broadly and of course nonthreateningly (har, har), at the political benefits of opening Amazon St. Louis or Amazon Detroit, of being seen as a company that renews cities and doesn't just put brick and mortar out of business. I don't have a strong view — yet — on whether we should treat internet giants like utilities. But when you enjoy a monopoly's powers, one way to avoid being regulated like one is to act with a kind pre-emptive patriotism, and behave as though what's good for America is good for Amazon as well."
0,2017-09-17," Here's what to expect in the week ahead: TECHNOLOGY The European Commission is expected to publish on Monday a list of options for taxing technology companies like Google and Amazon. These companies have been in the cross hairs of European officials because of their efforts to minimize the taxes they pay by recording profits in lower tax jurisdictions, like Luxembourg and Ireland. Last year, the European Commission ordered Ireland to collect $14.5 billion in unpaid taxes from Apple in a record penalty, saying that the company's deals with the Irish government had allowed it to pay virtually nothing on its European business in some years. Amie Tsang ECONOMY The housing market has been caught between two counteracting forces this year: a run of strong job growth that has lifted demand among home buyers, and a dearth of inventory that has kept many prospective home buyers finding nothing to buy. That has lead to seesaw numbers for a slew of housing data. Soon, the figures will get even harder to interpret, as the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, which pummeled the nation's largest new-housing market, affects the data. Housing starts, which come out on Tuesday, and existing home sales, which come out on Wednesday, shouldn't be affected by the storm just yet. So consider those numbers a baseline before volatility sets in over the next few months as rebuilding efforts get underway. Conor Dougherty  The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce that it will begin to reduce its vast holdings of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, an important step toward concluding its post-crisis economic stimulus campaign. The Fed's policy-making committee, which meets on Tuesday and Wednesday in Washington, is struggling to understand why inflation remains weak despite steady job growth and low unemployment. It is no longer clear whether the Fed will raise its benchmark interest rate again this year. But officials are sufficiently confident in the health of the economy to start whittling away at the $4 trillion bond portfolio, which was accumulated during the crisis to help hold down borrowing costs. The Fed plans to move slowly — minimizing the impact on economic conditions — initially reducing its holdings by just $10 billion a month. Binyamin Appelbaum  United States trade negotiators travel to Ottawa next Saturday to begin the third round of negotiations with Canada and Mexico on the North American Free Trade Agreement. President Trump has said that he would like the deal to be finalized by the end of the year, but analysts say that may be a challenge. Some proposals by the United States, including one that would allow the agreement to expire after five years unless the three countries vote to continue it, have rankled Mexican and Canadian counterparts.

0,2017-09-18," CONCORD, Calif. — Brazil's interim president, Michel Temer, is willing to sacrifice millions of acres of rain forest in pursuit of a 16th-century boondoggle: fortunes of gold in the Amazon. In August, Mr. Temer signed a decree to open a rain forest reserve — an area larger than Denmark — to commercial mining, threatening decades of progress on environmental protection and indigenous rights in the Amazon. The approximately 17,800-square-mile National Reserve of Copper and Associates, or Renca, which straddles the northern states of Pará and Amapá, was created by Brazil's military dictatorship in 1984 to guard mineral resources from foreign exploitation as the country staggered toward democracy. Today the reserve is a patchwork of conservation areas and indigenous lands. Its protected status has deterred the runaway development rampant elsewhere in the Amazon that has squelched biodiversity, destroyed indigenous communities and reduced millions of acres of rain forest to pastureland. During Brazil's last gold rush, in the 1980s, thousands of Yanomami people lost their land — and their lives — to the government-sponsored invasion of ""garimpeiros"" (prospectors) who exposed tribes to disease, alcohol, drugs and prostitution. The federal government is now investigating the suspected slaughter of more than 10 members of an isolated tribe on the border with Perú by miners who boasted at a bar of cutting up the dead, including women and children, and disposing of their remains in the river. Like his counterpart in the United States, Donald Trump, Mr. Temer treats environmental regulations like red tape. By opening roughly 30 percent of Renca to mining exploration, the decree sets a dangerous precedent by dissolving a longstanding federal barrier to development, leaving other protected areas within and beyond the reserve exposed to potential to research and exploration. Randolfe Rodrigues, an opposition senator from Amapá State, called the decree ""the biggest attack on the Amazon of the last 50 years."" For decades, Brazilian policy makers have looked at the rain forest as a source of future mineral, timber, oil and agricultural wealth, and little in the country's history suggests that the government can steward sustainable development in the planet's largest forest and watershed. In the 1970s, the Trans-Amazonian Highway project cut a 2,500-mile-long road across the Amazon Basin, promising to open the unexplored interior to settlement. Thousands of indigenous people were killed or forced to move, few settlers heard the call, and generations later the route is a largely unpaved thread connecting small towns with few economic opportunities. Another project from the twilight of the military regime, the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam, was resurrected in this century as a solution to Brazil's energy woes. The megaproject redirected the flow of one of the Amazon's largest tributaries to generate energy for development and mining projects, displacing thousands of indigenous people and other residents in the path of the floodwaters. Tribes in the area protested vigorously for years, only to be pacified with emergency aid programs so poorly managed that a federal prosecutor charged the government with ""ethnocide."" In the years since Renca was established, ranchers throughout the Amazon have slashed and burned their way deeper into the forest with impunity. The Amazon frontier has become a South American Wild West where land barons feud over property, extort judges and politicians with threats of violence, and abuse workers in conditions akin to slavery. Over time, a powerful lobby of ranchers, loggers, land speculators and mining companies has consolidated its political power, forming a pivotal congressional bloc — the ruralistas — who recently intervened to shield Mr. Temer from a federal corruption investigation. Mr. Temer is asking Brazilians to forget that history and trust in assurances that mining in Renca won't harm the environment and indigenous people, but mine operators' records in places like Minas Gerais State do not inspire confidence. In 2015, Brazil suffered what is regarded as  the worst environmental disaster in its history when an iron ore tailings dam in Minas Gerais failed, killing 17 people and poisoning the region's most important river with tons of toxic orange sludge that will take years to clean. Large-scale mining efforts are even riskier in the Amazon where so-called greenfield projects require the construction of roads, railways and hydroelectric dams that worsen deforestation, pollute the water supply and destroy plant and animal life. According to data collected by the Amazon Environmental Research Institute, a scientific organization working for the sustainable development of the Amazon, Renca is home to one of the highest concentrations of endangered mammals in the rain forest. According to Mr. Temer, though, ""It's no paradise."" His administration is quick to point to the presence of illegal loggers and miners in the reserve who are ""plundering the nation's wealth"" and polluting the water supply with mercury. They claim that legal operations will push out prospectors, but history shows that prospectors will be drawn like mosquitoes to the allure of fresh veins. The Pan-Amazonian Ecclesial Network, a group of Catholic clergy members in the region, calls the decree ""a blasphemy of Brazilian democracy,"" warning against ""increased land conflicts, uncontrolled aggression against cultures and lifestyles of indigenous and traditional communities, with large tax exemptions but minimum benefits for the people of the region."" Responding to worldwide outcry, the Temer administration tried to make its decree more palatable, but a federal judge suspended the opening of the reserve, saying the move would require congressional approval. Now the proposal is open for public comment. Unfortunately the decree is but one of many attacks on environmental regulations in Brazil. Three current bills under consideration could open more than 12 million acres (five million hectares) of protected forest over the next eight years. Mr. Temer has proposed a new mining code that shifts the responsibility for monitoring environmental standards away from the government and toward the companies themselves. Another catastrophic proposal would open all land within Brazil's protected border zone — a territory the size of Alaska — to foreign mining investment, bringing bulldozers and new waves of prospectors to the refuge of some of the world's last isolated tribes. The Amazon is a natural wonder enshrined in the Brazilian Constitution as part of the national patrimony. Its future is critical to Brazil, South America and the planet. It is also a region in chaos where local, state and federal governments struggle to deliver basic health and sanitation services, let alone regulate international mining operations. If Mr. Temer wants to stimulate economic development in the region, he should solicit foreign investors to repair and expand its public infrastructure so that the Amazon and its people can live up to their remarkable potential in fields like biotechnology, health care and sustainable fishing and agriculture. To accelerate mining in the Amazon in 2017 would only refresh the cycle of pillage, boom and bust that has plagued the world's largest forest since the first marauders arrived in search of El Dorado."

2,2017-09-18," While running errands the other day, I ducked into a local Best Buy to pick up a pair of new headphones. What I saw inside was shocking. Happy-looking people were huddled around tables filled with the latest gadgets from Microsoft and Apple. The video game aisle was bustling. Blue-shirted employees were helping a customer pick from a glowing wall of flat-screen TVs. There was a line — a line! — at the checkout counter. Many people, myself included, assumed that the entire big-box retail sector would eventually fall under Amazon's steamroller. I knew Best Buy had spent the past several years playing defense against Amazon, finding some initial success by cutting costs and reducing prices to match its online rivals. But Best Buy's rebound has been surprisingly durable. Revenue figures have beaten Wall Street's expectations in six of the last seven quarters. The company's stock price has risen more than 50 percent in the past year. Workers are happy. And judging from several other visits I paid to Best Buy stores, the chain appears to have avoided the bleak fate of other big-box retailers. How do they do it? To find out, I called Hubert Joly, Best Buy's chief executive. An upbeat Frenchman who spent more than a decade at the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, Mr. Joly, 58, explained that Best Buy's turnaround was years in the making, and that it involved reshaping nearly every piece of the business. It's a fascinating playbook for companies hoping to survive in the Amazon age. Here are the keys to Best Buy's turnaround, according to Mr. Joly: When Mr. Joly took over in 2012, Best Buy was bleeding out. A former chief had resigned after admitting to an improper romantic relationship with an employee. The company's systems were outdated and many stores were losing money. Many of the products that drew customers to stores, such as new CD and DVD releases, were becoming obsolete. The most worrisome trend in big-box retail was ""showrooming"" — customers were testing new products in stores before buying them for less money online from another retailer. To combat showrooming and persuade customers to complete their purchases at Best Buy, Mr. Joly announced a price-matching guarantee. ""Until I match Amazon's prices, the customers are ours to lose,"" Mr. Joly said. Price-matching costs Best Buy real money, but it also gives customers a reason to stay in the store, and avoids handing business to competitors. Mr. Joly also realized that if Best Buy was going to compete with Amazon, which has spent billions building a speedy delivery system and plans to use drones to become even more efficient, it needed to get better at things that robots can't do well — namely, customer service. In his first months on the job, Mr. Joly visited Best Buy stores near the company's Minnesota headquarters to ask rank-and-file employees about the struggles they encountered. (Among their gripes: an internal search engine that was returning bad data about which items were in stock.) Best Buy fixed the search engine. It also restored a much-loved employee discount that had been suspended and embarked on an ambitious program to retrain its employees so they could answer questions about entirely new categories of electronics, such as virtual reality headsets and smart home appliances. ""The associates in our stores are much more engaged now, much more proficient,"" Mr. Joly said. Customers had always loved Best Buy's Geek Squad, its army of specially trained tech support experts who could be hired to mount TVs and install other appliances at a customer's home. But sometimes, people needed help before they bought big and expensive gadgets. So it started an adviser program that allows customers to get free in-home consultations about what product they should buy, and how it should be installed. The service started as a pilot program last year and is now being rolled out nationwide. Best Buy has ""really come through the valley by making investments around the customer experience,"" said Peter Keith, a retail analyst with Piper Jaffray. When Mr. Joly arrived at Best Buy, the company's online ordering system was completely divorced from its stores. If a customer placed an order on the website, it would ship from a central warehouse. If that warehouse didn't have the item in stock, the customer was out of luck. Mr. Joly realized that with some minor changes, each of Best Buy's 1,000-plus big-box stores could ship packages to customers, serving as a mini warehouse for its surrounding area. Now, when a customer orders a product on Best Buy's website, the item is sent from the location that can deliver it the fastest — a store down the street, perhaps, or a warehouse five states away. It was a small, subtle change, but it allowed Best Buy to improve its shipping times, and made immediate gratification possible for customers. Now, roughly 40 percent of Best Buy's online orders are either shipped or picked up from a store. Best Buy also struck deals with large electronics companies like Samsung, Apple and Microsoft to feature their products in branded areas within the store. Now, rather than jamming these companies' products next to one another on shelves, Best Buy allows them to set up their own dedicated kiosks. (Apple's area inside a Best Buy, for example, has the same sleek wooden tables and minimalist design as an Apple Store.) It's a concept borrowed from department stores, and it's created a lucrative new revenue stream. Even Amazon has set up kiosks in Best Buy stores to show off its voice-activated Alexa gadgets. Granted, Best Buy has a last-man-standing advantage in these partnership deals. Many of its big-box rivals (Circuit City, Radio Shack, HH Gregg) have gone bankrupt or shut down completely. Which means that if Samsung wants to show off its newest line of tablets in a big-box electronics store, it has basically one choice. Almost every business turnaround plan includes cutting costs. Under Mr. Joly, Best Buy has used the scalpel as quietly as possible, gradually letting leases expire for unprofitable stores and consolidating its overseas divisions. He trimmed a layer of middle managers in 2014, and reassigned roughly 400 Geek Squad employees within the company. But he has never announced a huge, public round of layoffs, which can crater employee morale and create a sinking-ship vibe. ""Taking people out is the last resort,"" Mr. Joly said in 2015. ""Because you need to capture the hearts and minds of the employees."" Best Buy has also found more creative penny-pinching methods. Once, the company noticed that an unusually high number of flat-screen TVs were being dropped in its warehouses. It revamped the handling process, reducing the number of times TVs were picked up by a clamp lift and adding new carts to prevent TV boxes from falling over. The changes resulted in less broken inventory and bigger profits. Mr. Joly didn't explicitly tell me this, but it is obvious: Best Buy has benefited from some serious good fortune. It's lucky that the products it specializes in selling, like big-screen TVs and high-end audio equipment, are big-ticket items that many customers still feel uncomfortable buying sight unseen from a website. It's lucky that several large competitors have gone out of business, shrinking its list of rivals. And it's lucky that the vendors who make the products it sells, like Apple and Samsung, have kept churning out expensive blockbuster gadgets. ""They're at the mercy of the product cycles,"" said Stephen Baker, a tech industry analyst at NPD Group. ""If people stop buying PCs or they don't care about big-screen TVs anymore, they have a challenge."" Mr. Joly knows that despite Best Buy's recent momentum, it's not out of the woods yet. To succeed over the long term, it will need to do more than cut costs and match prices. Walmart, another big-box behemoth, is investing billions of dollars in a digital expansion with the acquisition of e-commerce companies like Jet and Bonobos, and could prove to be a fierce rival. Amazon has been expanding into brick-and-mortar retail with its acquisition of Whole Foods, and is moving into Best Buy's home installation and services market. Mr. Joly is optimistic about Best Buy's chances against these Goliaths, but he's not ready to celebrate yet. ""Once you've had a near-death experience,"" he said, ""arrogance, if you had it in your bones, has disappeared forever."""

6,2017-09-18," For a long time, American technology giants have received a chilly reception from skeptical audiences in Europe, including from government regulators, while at home, companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon have been largely lauded for their innovation and their astonishing growth. That is starting to change, however, with scrutiny in the United States growing ever sharper. Facebook The New York Times takes a long look at how the social networking behemoth's global ambitions are being checked around the world. (There's video, too.) • The social network is still blocked in China, in spite of Mark Zuckerberg's efforts to ingratiate himself. • European officials have pushed back against Facebook's efforts to gather data from messaging apps and third-party websites. This is a stance that is being taken by other regulators too, in places like Colombia and Japan. • The social media giant's latest tussles are now in countries like Vietnam and Kenya. In Africa, Facebook is trying to become ""the internet,"" helping people get online, subsidizing access, but critics have compared the company's efforts to colonialism. At home, Facebook has begun cooperating with Robert S. Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 American presidential election, after his team served the company a search warrant. And Facebook last week made changes to its advertising platform after ProPublica found ways to target advertisements to self-identified anti-Semites. But Facebook still has been reticent in embracing the responsibility that comes with being a hugely powerful platform, The Times's Jim Rutenberg asserts. Google • Last week, Google faced a lawsuit by three female former employees who argued that male colleagues systematically were paid more money and were up for promotions more often. • Last month, the company faced criticism after a critic was fired from the New America Foundation, a think tank backed by the technology titan's executive chairman, Eric E. Schmidt. • Google is still battling with European antitrust officials who imposed a $2.7 billion fine for anticompetitive practices. Uber Portland's investigation into the ride-hailing giant's ""Greyball"" program, in which special software allowed it to avoid regulatory scrutiny, ended last week without any fines. But Uber still faces a federal investigation into the program. Meanwhile, European officials are expected to publish options for taxing international tech giants. It is part of the European Union's crackdown on tax avoidance, which has taken a sharp look at how these companies record profits in lower tax jurisdictions. (Remember that Apple received $14.5 billion bill for unpaid taxes last year.) Related Reading: Ellen Pao weighs in on the apparent sea change in how Silicon Valley recognizes and deals with accusations of sexual harassment. Despite tangible overhauls at places like Uber and Social Finance, Ms. Pao — who memorably sued her old firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, for discrimination — says that more work must be done. ""Let's not be blinded by optimism or biased by what we want to see: Certain actions, and lack of action, could keep us in this unfair loop indefinitely,"" she writes in The Times's Sunday Review. Its roots are in counterculture, but Rolling Stone has struggled with the same problems as the rest of the publishing industry — print advertising revenue and newsstand sales have fallen. Strategic missteps and a bruised journalistic reputation have taken a financial toll. So Jann S. Wenner, the founder, is putting his company's controlling stake in Rolling Stone up for sale, relinquishing control after half a century. The plans were devised by Mr. Wenner's son, Gus, the president and chief operating officer of Wenner Media. The younger Wenner has already aggressively pared down the company's assets: The publisher recently sold Us Weekly and Men's Journal. The buyer of those titles, American Media, could also be a possible suitor for Rolling Stone. The main thing is that Jann Wenner wants a buyer that understands Rolling Stone's mission. Perhaps more important, any suitor would have to have ""lots of money,"" he said. Caveat: BandLab Technologies, a music tech company based in Singapore, took a 49 percent stake in Rolling Stone last year for $40 million, which could complicate a potential deal. Worth Noting:  The Wenners' decision comes after magazine editors across the industry announced they would step down: Graydon Carter at Vanity Fair, Robbie Myers at Elle, Nancy Gibbs of Tim magazine and Cindi Leive of Glamour. A union of the two defense contractors could be worth more than $7.5 billion, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported. Orbital, which makes space rocket motors and satellites, has a market value of $6.3 billion. It would add to the heft of Northrop, which has a market capitalization of more than $45 billion. Any deal would come after United Technologies agreed to buy Rockwell Collins. Behind the Deal-Making: Defense budgets are climbing amid rising tensions around the world and the Trump administration making the Pentagon a priority. And military contractors are looking to consolidate to save on costs and better control their supply chains, the Journal argues. The workplace messaging app collected $250 million in a new round of financing that valued it at $5.1 billion. Much of that money came from the tech world's favorite cash-rich investor of the moment, SoftBank and its enormous Vision Fund, The Financial Times and Bloomberg reported. The fund-raising round came after Slack began exploring financing options earlier this year. It also follows yet more growth in the service's business: Last week it reported that it had hit $200 million in annual recurring revenue. Stewart Butterfield, Slack's chief executive, conceded that with revenue at that level, tech companies would usually have held an initial public offering by now. ""It's a strange world. If it was 10 years ago we'd be public by now,"" he told The F.T. An I.P.O. is coming, he said. But not until after 2018. In Other SoftBank News: The Japanese tech conglomerate is still interested in ride-hailing — it is near a deal to invest billions into Uber — and many, many other things. But a senior executive, Deep Nishar, asserts that the company isn't just throwing money around. ""It's not just taking a bunch of dollar bills and spreading them around,"" he said at a Harvard Business School conference, according to Recode. JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, argued last week that Bitcoin was a ""fraud."" His main contention: one ""can't have a business where people are going to invent a currency out of thin air."" But Jeremy G. Philips, a partner at Spark Capital, asserts in Another View on DealBook that the banking executive is mistaken. Among Mr. Philips' points: • Fiat currencies, where countries' central banks ultimately determine the value of the money, exist. The prime example: the dollar. • JPMorgan Chase itself has created a kind of fiat currency in the form of its Ultimate Rewards credit card loyalty program. • The bank is working on Quorum, a project based on the blockchain technology that underpins Bitcoin. • Plenty of use cases are emerging for Bitcoin and other digital currencies that don't rely on a central authority. ""Undoubtedly, there will be plenty of hits and misses, as one would expect in the early days of a new technology,"" Mr. Philips writes. ""But the toothpaste is now out of the tube, and there is sufficient momentum for legitimate use cases to develop.""

0,2017-09-20," WASHINGTON — Last month, Facebook and Google came out forcefully against a bill that would hold companies accountable for hosting sex trafficking on their websites. They said that while they worked hard to combat sex trafficking, changing the law ""jeopardizes bedrock principles of a free and open internet"" that have been crucial to innovation for decades. By this week, the two companies were hoping to reach a compromise with lawmakers, an acknowledgment that they could not stop the bill entirely because of strong political headwinds. The shifting position illustrates the changing political reality in Washington for some of the country's biggest technology companies. After years of largely avoiding regulation, businesses like Facebook, Google and Amazon are a focus of lawmakers, some of whom are criticizing the expanding power of big tech companies and their role in the 2016 election. The attacks cover a smattering of issues as diverse as antitrust, privacy and public disclosure. They also come from both sides, from people like Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump's former chief strategist, as well as Senator Elizabeth Warren, a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts. Many of the issues, like revising antitrust laws, have a slim chance of producing new laws soon. But they have become popular talking points nonetheless, amplified by a series of missteps and disclosures by the companies, including Facebook telling Congress this month that fake accounts linked to Russia had bought over $100,000 in political ads on the service. ""There is much stronger agreement among me and my colleagues that there needs to be more aggressive enforcement action on tech companies like Google,"" said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut and a sponsor of the sex trafficking bill. The companies, recognizing the new environment in Washington, have started to fortify their lobbying forces and recalibrate their positions. In the last year, Amazon has added antitrust to its roster of issues, hiring a former senior Senate staff member who helped shape antitrust policies. Google has paid several outside lobbying firms to argue against the sex trafficking bill, according to recent federal filings. ""We are disruptive, and that creates a lot of tension, concern, worry and jealousy and sometimes rightfully identifies real problems that need solutions,"" said Ed Black, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, which represents Facebook, Google, Amazon and other tech companies. Tech companies have faced political pressure in Europe for years. That is expected to continue, with regulators prepared to push a new set of proposals to get the tech companies to pay more in taxes. The politics for the companies in the United States began to change after the 2016 presidential election, when attention turned to the role social media sites play in shaping public opinion. The  scrutiny grew after companies struggled to eliminate fake content from their sites, raising fears that the platforms were too big to manage. After Facebook revealed to Congress that it had accepted money for political ads from fake accounts linked to Russia, Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, started calling for new disclosure laws for the companies. He plans to begin writing a bill this week that requires Facebook and other social media companies to release funding sources for political ads, as is required for television broadcasters. ""This is uncharted territory,"" Mr. Warner said in an interview. ""The growth in political advertising is in the digital world, and if this is the most targeted and potentially most effective way into politics, the paid advertising rules that broadcasters rely upon should also apply in the social media world."" Perhaps no issue in Washington has exposed the vulnerability of the tech companies as much as the sex trafficking bill. At the heart of the debate for the tech companies is a change to a 20-year-old law that prevents people from suing internet companies for things people post on websites. The companies, supported by some civil liberties groups, say the existing law has protected free speech and allowed internet companies to grow without fear of lawsuits. The bill being debated, written by Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, and Mr. Blumenthal, would allow state and local authorities to prosecute sites that host content related to sex trafficking. Their bill, which has bipartisan support from dozens of members in the Senate, would also enable people to sue websites. Companies like Google and Facebook vehemently opposed the law when it was introduced, warning that it would expose web companies to numerous lawsuits because the actions of users are hard to police. The bill had provisions that would shield companies like Google and Facebook that have policies to combat sex trafficking, but the companies pushed back nonetheless. Starting about two weeks ago, as politicians stepped up their attacks against their businesses, Facebook and Google realized that the political landscape had changed, according to two people with knowledge of the decisions who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the internal corporate decisions were private. So instead, the companies began trying to negotiate changes to the bill with Mr. Portman and other senators instead of trying to stop it entirely. As of Tuesday, Facebook and Google were still trying to negotiate changes with Senate staff members. One effort, by Google, would block state attorneys general from prosecuting web platforms for hosting any third-party sites that aided sex trafficking. Google said the Justice Department should be the sole agency in charge of enforcing sex trafficking laws. Mr. Portman has viewed enforcement by state attorneys general as the centerpiece of the legislation. He will not agree to weakening the enforcement role of local and state prosecutors, according to his spokesman, Kevin Smith. ""We'll continue to engage members of Congress, anti-trafficking organizations and the industry to try and get to a resolution that addresses the problem without creating unintended side effects,"" Susan Molinari, Google's vice president of public policy, said in a statement. Facebook appeared more eager to reach a deal with lawmakers, according to two Senate staff members and a tech industry official, who all said the company had expressed a willingness to allow state law enforcement. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because Facebook's discussions with the lawmakers were private. ""We strongly believe that there is a legislative solution that can address this terrible problem while ensuring that the internet remains open and free and that responsible companies can continue to work to stop sex trafficking before it happens,"" Erin Egan, a vice president of public policy at Facebook, said in a statement. Senators have not held back their continued frustration with the tech industry, even as the position of the companies has changed somewhat. On Tuesday, the Senate commerce committee held an emotional hearing on bill, called the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, that included the mother of a teenage victim of trafficking. The Senate invited Facebook and Google to testify but they declined, according to a member of the committee staff, instead sending their trade group, the Internet Association, to represent them. ""Silicon Valley holds itself out as being more than just an industry but a movement to make the world a better place,"" Mr. Portman said in the hearing. ""But selling human beings online is the dark side of the internet."" Other issues related to tech companies have gained less traction. The earliest criticism of big tech companies came from left-leaning politicians and economists, whose ideas were largely dismissed by Washington lawyers and regulators as fringe ideas. But there are signs that the companies are starting to take them more seriously now as well. The New America Foundation, a left-leaning research group in Washington that is financed by Google and Eric Schmidt, the chairman of its parent company, recently fired a division of antitrust scholars who had been critical of the company. Google has denied playing a role in the split. In California, big tech companies joined internet service providers like AT&T and Comcast — their adversaries on many policy issues — to fight a state broadband privacy law, fearing that it could embolden other states and federal regulators to write broader internet privacy rules. Even Amazon's recent move to buy Whole Foods Market for $13.4 billion generated political attention. Amazon and Whole Foods have a small portion of the overall grocery market, an important measure in antitrust decisions, and the deal quickly passed an antitrust review by the Federal Trade Commission. But some lawmakers raised questions about Amazon's deep pockets and its ability to undercut the prices of smaller competitors. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, pressed F.T.C. officials to justify their decision, arguing that the agency should have looked at longer-term competition factors. She has also introduced a bill that would force companies to prove that their deals would not be anticompetitive in the future. ""We need to start adjusting to a world where we are right now,"" said Ms. Klobuchar. ""Antitrust laws haven't been updated since the 1950s. In the 1950s, they didn't envision a major search engine dominating the internet. They didn't even have the internet."""
1,2017-09-20," BRUSSELS — The European Union's offensive against Silicon Valley looks as though it is likely to resume, as officials in Brussels consider a raft of proposals aimed at increasing the amount of tax paid by digital titans like Facebook and Amazon. The new proposals, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times on Wednesday, broadly aim to tax internet companies in the countries where they generate their business, rather than allow them to shift profits to jurisdictions with lower rates. But the plans will give ammunition to critics who argue the European Union unfairly targets the United States technology sector. Though the bloc's leaders deny that they single out American firms, opponents point to an array of investigations against household names for suspected violations ranging from how they handle user data to antitrust complaints. But it was not clear whether the latest effort by the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, would gain sufficient traction. Any such reform would require the unanimous approval of the bloc's 28 member states. While several major countries like France have pushed for a crackdown, others do not want to change a system in which some of them can attract corporations with tax incentives and other inducements. In seeking to tax revenue rather than profit — one of the options being considered — European regulators want to ensure that major internet companies pay taxes to national treasuries where they do business. For example, Amazon, a target of the commission in the past, operates across the European Union, but lists its regional headquarters as Luxembourg, a tiny country with a population of around 500,000, and so can take advantage of its low taxes. ""The main challenge is to reform the international tax framework, which was first designed at the start of the 20th century and is no longer fit for purpose,"" the report said. It will be published by the commission on Thursday. The existing system ""has worked well for traditional 'brick and mortar' companies but as business activities have become more globalized and digitalized the old rules work less well,"" it continued. It found that companies that did their business online were paying an effective tax rate of 8.5 percent, or less than half that paid by more traditional businesses. The European Union stepped up its efforts to curb tax avoidance, by companies as well as wealthy individuals, after the financial crisis, which forced many of its member states to adopt belt-tightening measures, slashing public services and raising taxes. But because big corporations were able to shift their profits to low-tax countries, critics of the austerity programs argued that the brunt of the cuts impacted small businesses and individual citizens. In the years since, calls have increased for large companies to be more transparent and pay more tax. American tech companies, in particular, have found themselves the targets of the commission's ire. Commission officials are investigating Google and Qualcomm for allegedly abusing their dominant market position. Officials in Brussels are looking into Amazon's tax practices in Europe. And the commission has demanded that Ireland recover about $14.5 billion in back taxes from Apple. The commission said in its latest proposals that it wants to agree to a long-term solution with other countries around the world. But that could take a long time to negotiate, and may not close enough loopholes, so it put forward several shorter-term plans that could wind up meaning companies like Amazon, Facebook and Netflix pay larger tax bills in Europe much sooner. ""In the absence of adequate global progress, E.U. solutions should be advanced,"" the commission said, adding that it could make more formal proposals on taxation in the coming months. The potential reforms it outlined include taxing companies based on their revenue rather than their profits, allowing national authorities to tax payments made by consumers to digital businesses, and allowing individual countries to tax revenue generated from advertising by internet companies. France has thrown its weight behind the first of those reforms, in particular. But questions have been raised over whether taxing revenue is a viable plan. Businesses that turn a hefty profit could effectively pay the same as a company of a similar size that has narrower margins, or even loses money. ""The fundamental question is where is the business really being conducted,"" said J. Scott Marcus, an analyst at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. ""The devil is in the details with a digital service across borders — the service can be made anywhere."" ""The question is who gets the tax,"" he continued. ""It's a genuine challenge."""
2,2017-09-20," LONDON — Amazon said on Wednesday that it was reviewing its website after a British television report said the online retail giant's algorithms were automatically suggesting bomb-making ingredients that were ""Frequently bought together."" The news is particularly timely in Britain, where the authorities are investigating a terrorist attack last week on London's Underground subway system. The attack involved a crude explosive in a bucket inside a plastic bag, and detonated on a train during the morning rush. The news report is the latest example of a technology company drawing criticism for an apparently faulty algorithm. Google and Facebook have come under fire for allowing advertisers to direct ads to users who searched for, or expressed interest in, racist sentiments and hate speech. Growing awareness of these automated systems has been accompanied by calls for tech firms to take more responsibility for the contents on their sites. Amazon customers buying products that were innocent enough on their own, like cooking ingredients, received ""Frequently bought together"" prompts for other items that would help them produce explosives, according to the  Channel 4 News. Although many of the ingredients mentioned by Channel 4 News are not illegal on their own, the report said there had been successful prosecutions in Britain against individuals who bought chemicals and components that can produce explosives. Amazon said in a statement that all the products sold on its website ""must adhere to our selling guidelines and we only sell products that comply with U.K. laws."" ""In light of recent events, we are reviewing our website to ensure that all these products are presented in an appropriate manner,"" the statement continued. ""We also continue to work closely with police and law enforcement agencies when circumstances arise where we can assist their investigations."" The company declined to comment further. The New York Times found that similar algorithms may be at work in the United States. In one instance, a search for magnesium ribbon — a product that can be used to make a crude fuse — yielded a suggestion for two powders that explode when mixed together in the right proportions and then ignited. A second search yielded a suggestion for two out of three ingredients necessary to make gunpowder. Other tech companies have been in the spotlight for the algorithms that fuel their websites. ProPublica, a nonprofit news outlet, revealed last week that Facebook had enabled advertisers to seek out self-described ""Jew haters"" and other anti-Semitic topics. In response, Facebook said it would restrict how advertisers targeted their audiences. Buzzfeed also reported on how Google allowed the sale of ads tied to racist and bigoted keywords, automatically suggesting more offensive terms. Google said it would work harder to halt the offensive ads. Facebook has also come under scrutiny for potentially being used to influence people during the American presidential election last year. It disclosed this month that fake accounts based in Russia had purchased more than $100,000 worth of ads on divisive issues in the lead-up to the vote. Last week's attack at Parsons Green train station was the fifth terrorist attack in Britain in a matter of months. Several people have been arrested in the investigation of the explosion, in which dozens of people were wounded."
0,2017-09-21," Amazon recently sent state and city officials across the country scrambling to respond to its announcement that it was seeking enticements to build a second headquarters, promising 50,000 new jobs and $5 billion in investment to the winning location. Governments are mobilizing to devise lucrative incentive packages. I know how this works, because I spent eight years supporting these types of incentives as the governor of Delaware. Amazon's public encouragement of a bidding war highlights a competition that state and local governments engage in every day. I became very familiar with this process: A big business promises thousands, hundreds or even dozens of jobs and waits for offers from mayors and governors eager to demonstrate to voters that they are bringing them jobs. In Delaware, our economic development office, with my full approval, was busy calculating direct subsidies to corporations through grants and tax breaks. I was as guilty as any elected official at playing this game. But it's a game that should stop. There's a better way to compete for business. A New York Times investigation in 2012 found that states, counties and cities were handing out  more than $80 billion a year in incentives to attract and retain companies. Amazon, for example, has already benefited from hundreds of millions of dollars in public subsidies as it expanded its warehouse network around the country, according to a report last year by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. The company's new request for proposals seeks a combination of the types of direct payments that governors and mayors regularly make to businesses: incentives to reduce initial capital costs, relocation and work force grants, tax credits and exemptions, reduction of other fees and assistance with utility costs. In Delaware, despite some notable failed investments (especially trying to save a closed General Motors factory), government incentives during my tenure resulted in the reopening of a refinery, the near doubling of employment in the state by one of the world's largest banks and keeping two of the three spinoffs from the Dow/Dupont merger in Delaware. I don't regret making those investments to keep jobs from going to other states. But it would be better for taxpayers if these kinds of cash incentives could be invested instead in such things as schools and infrastructure. I don't blame companies like Amazon for playing the incentives game. They have a responsibility to do their best by their shareholders and workers in a climate where competitors are benefiting from similar payouts. Interestingly, though, the chief executives I worked with as governor were less interested in short-term incentives and more focused on long-term partnerships that would help ensure their success. They viewed these incentives as evidence that state and local officials were committed to their company's future. And I don't blame public officials, either, for their efforts to attract businesses with enticements, since they otherwise would risk losing out on new jobs, the transfer of old ones elsewhere and the bad publicity that could come with abandoning efforts to entice or retain companies. That would be the equivalent of competing with other cities and states with one arm tied behind your back, and like other leaders, I wasn't going to do that as governor. The result is a market failure in which neither side is motivated to fix the problem. State and local policy makers can't unilaterally opt out without potentially negative consequences for their constituents, while businesses have a fiduciary obligation to pursue these short-term direct incentives. Competition for jobs should not be seen to hinge on which government can write the biggest check to an employer but on the kinds of things that officials in Delaware and other states spend so much time on to make their communities places worth living in: the quality of schools, work force development programs, the transportation grid and other infrastructure, and the overall quality of life. The solution is straightforward: Congress should institute a federal tax of 100 percent on every dollar a business receives in state or local incentives that are directed specifically to that company. This would not include investments in public infrastructure, work force development or other investments that can attract employers while also providing a significant long-term benefit to taxpayers. This tax would, however, end payouts that go directly to a company's bottom line and would eliminate the pressure these companies are under to pursue such enticements. I'm talking about incentives like direct grants to a company in exchange for the creation of a specific number of jobs (something we did in Delaware while I was governor) or free or reduced land or the passage of a tax policy tailored specifically to one company. States would still compete for these jobs — but they would do so in a way that better aligns with the long-term interests of taxpayers and the businesses themselves. States and municipalities would also retain the ability to institute tax-friendly policies for certain sectors — like small businesses or high-tech firms (Delaware, for example, has instituted one of the most attractive research and development tax credits in the country). This approach would provide a significant victory for taxpayers. Instead of making direct payments to businesses, states and municipalities would invest in and compete solely based on factors that make the most difference for an area's economic potential and for a company's ultimate success, like the abilities of the work force, the excellence of their schools and the quality of life for residents. That is a competition worth having."
1,2017-09-21," Last week, a Silicon Valley startup called Bodega instigated an internet meltdown after a Fast Company profile made the company's intentions clear. ""Eventually, centralized shopping locations won't be necessary, because there will be 100,000 Bodegas spread out, with one always 100 feet away from you,"" said Paul McDonald, a co-founder, who used to work at Google. The outrage made moral sense. ""Bodega"" is name that's asking for trouble, especially with people who frequent them. The outrage is also easy. Where's the upset over the effect other, bigger companies – like Amazon, whose latest major acquisition, Whole Foods, has slashed prices – might actually have on bodegas? Being mad at Amazon is harder when it's mixed up in so much of your life. We discuss the dilemma. We also get into the horror at the movies (""It,"" ""Mother!"") and on TV (""American Horror Story: Cult""), and how it meets up with our times in surprising and hilarious ways — especially Darren Aronofsky's ""Mother!"" with Jennifer Lawerence and Javier Bardem.

JW: I mostly write about how humans relate to technology. WM: And I mostly write about how popular culture relates to humans. JW: This is...Still Processing. And we're back. WM: Hi. JW: Hi. WM: What's going on? JW: Nothing. WM: You're rocking whatever's going on over here. JW: Sports bra? WM: Ivy Park sports bra! JW: Look, it only took until September for summer to finally get here, so I'm working with it. WM: I got told today — by you! — that I look like a substitute teacher who is trying to be cool at a different school. JW: You're literally Drew Barrymore in Never Been Kissed. Good job. So...what's topping your personal pop chart this week? WM: So, the Emmys happened on Sunday. There was a lot of good news. One extremely infuriating thing that had nothing to do with anybody winning or losing, except America. But there were two good speeches! The first was Ann Dowd's speech, your favorite, Ann Dowd from The Leftovers and The Handmaid's Tale. She won supporting actress in a drama for Handmaid's Tale. And she just gave this really strange, peculiar speech. I just want to play a little bit from it. AD: Well, I think this is a dream, you know. Um...I know it's an actor's dream, and I'm deeply grateful to you. I've been acting for um, a long time, and that this should happen now, I don't have the words, so I thank you. WM: And then...the other great speech from that night was Lena Waithe winning for writing the best episode of Master of None, with Aziz Ansari. The Thanksgiving episode. LW: And last, but certainly not least, my LGBTQIA family. I see each and every one of you. The things that make us different, those are our superpowers. Every day, when you walk out the door, put on your imaginary cape and go out there and conquer the world, because the world would not be as beautiful as it is if we weren't in it. And for everybody out there that showed us so much love for this episode, thank you for embracing a little Indian boy from South Carolina and a little queer black girl from the South Side of Chicago. We appreciate it more than you could ever know. WM: I like how she said it. She — JW: L-G-B-T-Q-I-A. WM: At some point, Trump was trying to do it that way during the campaign. He was trying to like...to all my LGBTQIA brothers and sisters — I see you. I see you. Anyway, listen. I saw It over the weekend. It's really not, I mean, it's not ugh. JW: It looks scary! WM: For me, I mean, it takes a lot for me at this point because my tolerance is so high. There's one thing in this movie that really freaked me out. There's a really great surprise playing around with dimensionality, you know, big and small, and it's so effective and so unexpected and so scary. I actually don't think the reason that move is popular is because it's a horror movie. Or even because of Stephen King necessarily. I think the movie is popular because we're going through some weird nostalgia thing right now where it's so much more fun to be in 1988 than it is to be in 2017. JW: That's super real. WM: I have a real world problem that we have to talk about. Last week, it was announced that Nestle is buying Blue Bottle Coffee. JW: I can't believe I missed that. It's gross. I mean, good for them, but also, that's gross. WM: I didn't know anything about how bad Nestle was, and I open up our newspaper on Sunday and there's a story about how Nestle is one of these companies that is responsible for the obesity epidemic in countries that aren't ours! In Brazil, for instance, the obesity rates have gone up because of the influx of processed food from places like Nestle. The reason I'm upset about this is because I've been drinking Blue Bottle Coffee since Blue Bottle Coffee started. It was just a cute little thing that I did in California, and it was one of many coffee purveyors, but I preferred this one. It's like one of the only products that I feel a very personal affinity for and connection to. You know what I mean? It's one of those things where like, I've been there from the beginning, and then you know, I have no say in what their business thinking is. If they want to, you know, I'm not a shareholder. If they want to let Nestle buy them, what should I do? JW: Find another coffee place to support, or just keeping Blue Bottle. What are you going to do? WM: I don't know. I feel like this is probably what we're going to wind up talking about today, which is like, wherever you look... JW: The milk is never clean. WM: I know. I know, we talk about this so much. Such a quandary. What's going on with you? JW: I'll start with a little spot of good news. Ever since I witnessed Rihanna/Robin Fenty at the launch of Fenty beauty, resplendent in yellow top to bottom, head to toe, looking like the reboot of Beauty from Beauty and the Beast that I would watch, that I would pay $10 to watch — WM: Oh, yeah. It was very Beauty and the Beast. I didn't even appreciate that. JW: Our Belle of the ball. I just have had a renewed appreciation for yellow, the color yellow, which I never wear because I have a yellow undertone and I just feel like it will make me look ill or not be flattering, so I've been conditioned out of wearing yellow. But I started wearing yellow, and I get so many compliments. WM: It's a good color for you. JW: Everyone on the street knows it's in reference to Rihanna, which makes it even more delightful. A guy in a bodega was like, Fenty, head to toe. And I was like, yes, boo! And then that was it, and I got my sandwich and left. So, as usual, I like to know more about why colors resonate and what is speaking to what universe, and so, I did a little research on Google and I found that the color yellow correlates to the third chakra in the body, which is the solar plexis. It refers to something known as the lustrous gem of the body. So, your solar plexis is a source of personal power. It governs the self esteem, warrior energy, and the power of transformation, so thank you, Rihanna, for yet another gift into my life. WM: Oh my God. She just keeps giving. JW: She never stops giving. WM: What else? JW: Last week, I had the privilege of being taken on a date to see Ms. Erykah Badu in New Jersey. WM: Stop it. You need to stop right now! JW: Me or my date? WM: Uh, the whole thing. I didn't get an invitation. I didn't even know she was in the vicinity. JW: You didn't feel the earth shake? You didn't feel the universal ripple? You didn't feel your energy shift? You know, we talk a lot on the show about how musicians age, how celebrities age, how art ages and what holds up, and I'm happy to report that from Mama's Gun to Baduizm to her new EP to Amerykah One and Two, it all still holds up. Her voice is transcendent. She also performed the majority of the show in a giant oversized cowboy hat in like a laser pyramid. Let's play Hello off her 2015 mixtape, but you can't use my phone, because she opened with that and it just sounds so good live. HELLO, ERYKAH BADU JW: Well, Internet got her panties in a twist last week over a new little startup called Bodega. You probably heard about it. WM: Oh, I heard about it. JW: You heard all about it. A new startup out of California that's basically like, a DYI, buy what you want little pantry box that's...I mean, the name alone is insulting, but the founders took it a step further and acknowledged, like, yeah, we're trying to put bodegas out of business. We want this to replace the mom and pop corner store bodega. Of course, Twitter goes HAM, rightfully so to some degrees. But I can't help but think that that outrage is a little misplaced. It's extraordinarily valid. I mean, this is a pretty abhorrent principle and it's embarrassing that these guys are so blatantly and flagrantly like, yes, we want to put a ton of immigrants out of business. We don't care about them! Just to make our lives easier, so we can have the fancy sparkling water and whatever, whenever we want. But I also want to challenge the way we responded to that, because I think that's a very easy, that's a very easy company to take aim at, and they do deserve it, but I think it also allows us to ignore all the other things we're very complicit in about new technology and startups and the actual, real ways the companies we actually use every day are terror forming planet Earth. Not some little hypothetical thing that's going to end up in startups up and down the west coast and not actually be, you know, at the corner of Fulton and Flatbush any time soon. WM: Alright. I'd like to talk about that with you. You're like the only person I want to talk about that with. JW: Well, I want to talk to you about It and horror movies in general and I know we both also saw Mother!, which I definitely want to talk about. WM: Yeah. I would pay more money to hear you talk about Mother! than I would to see Mother!, and I actually had a really good time at that movie, so I would love to talk about horror movies. I also want to talk about how horror is right now, for reasons that are really fascinating to me, a vehicle for several other ideas, and how you can be scared but you can also be thinking about what you're actually scared of. So, let's start with talking about Bodega, and the pros and cons of being mad at Bodega, and then the pros and cons of... JW: Indulging in all this existential horror. WM: Right. Well, we'll be right back. JW: Wesley. We need to talk about this new startup called Bodega. WM: Do we? JW: We do. We absolutely do, because there is the actual implementation of a startup that is meant to disrupt, meant to gentrify, meant to cater to a one percent, a growing one percent class that is not the Wall Street billionaires that we associate with the one percent but a newly minted class of wealthy developers and Silicon Valley, you know, acolytes who don't want to deal with the nitty gritty and the dirty and the reality of just living in a city. That's part of it. WM: Brown people. JW: Brown people. Well, some of them are brown. WM: Like, messy bodegas. It's a snobbery. JW: Sure. It's a snobbery. It's a snobbery and an interest in luxury above all else, right? But what we also really have to talk about, and actually what this entire episode is about is reality versus the perception of reality. WM: Yes, ma'am. JW: So, the reality is that these two ex-Googlers launched a company called Bodega, very well funded by some well known VCs. The idea is that you get these little vending machines that are self sufficient, they can go in offices, they can go in Air BnBs, they can go wherever you might need a snack. So, this thing launches, there's a big splashy article in Fast Company that really does them no favors. And the logo of this company is a bodega cat. They really give them no cushion to make this sound acceptable whatsoever. They present it for what it appears to be: two gratuitous interlopers who are more than happy to put out a ton of immigrants and completely change a culture of cities like New York and San Francisco for the sake of improving and sanitizing and Wall-E-izing, really, American culture. WM: Wall-E. It saw the future, back in 2008. JW: It really did. So basically, Twitter goes HAM. And everyone is like, how dare you. You can't get a chopped cheese out of a vending machine, really just going in on this company. Which, to be fair, they deserved. Because they were incredibly ungenerous and incredibly callous about the impact on local communities that this startup might have. They didn't have the decency to lie. And actually, in a way, all they did was tell the truth, which is hilarious unto itself. WM: Well, and I think you know, I'm a big fan of transparency. They were very honest about it. They were very clear about their goals. Business plan was right up front coming right out of this guy's mouth. JW: And yet, let's take a closer look at what they outlined their business imperative and rollout to be. They said, essentially they were B to B, so business to business, so, you know, not really going to be on street corners because people would probably smash them. But they were going to be in other businesses — yeah, you'd smash them. I mean, the kiosks that people charge their phones in get knocked over, so a bodega vending machine is definitely going to get smashed as well. Realistically, though, it was a pretty modest roll out. It was pretty much business to business. They said 50 locations up and down the west coast, which to me just screams, startups. It says, this is not going to be on a boardwalk. This is not going to be at the corner of, you know, Hayes and Goff in San Francisco. Not 6th and Market in San Francisco. It's going to be in the new Twitter offices, if anything else, you know what I mean? So, basically not that big of a deal. But what I'm interested in is why people got so upset, and why the pile on was so loud and so fun. Do you have any ideas? WM: Because it's easy. JW: You get a Snickers bar. Because that is the correct answer. WM: Can I get it out of a vending machine? I'm going to pick up my bodega cat and walk to the register and get my Snickers with my own two feet, thank you very much. JW: But you know, I mean, I think it's worth looking at why mostly Twitter and new, newly entitled media gets extremely upset about something like this and yet has nothing to say about Nestle buying Blue Bottle. About Amazon working its way into Whole Foods. About Fresh Direct. About Instacart. About the proliferation of Uber and all the million Uber clones. All the things that we actually use on a day to day basis that are actually completely reshaping who is moving where and how things are being gentrified. Like, no one's going to use this Bodega. But people will actually start using Prime to get Whole Foods. And that is a bigger deal. And in some ways, I'm excited — that is a much bigger threat to bodegas. But we don't want to talk about it because you know what? How many people in this room have Amazon Prime? I wanted to let my subscription lapse. It didn't. I'm going to be real about it. I forgot to turn it off, and I still use it. And I like it! Okay? Because if I need a new iPhone case, guess what? It comes in one day. So, I'm just like, look. You don't get points just because you're willing to call evil evil. You actually have to do something about it. What happened in New York a week ago? We had, what, primary elections? Did you vote? WM: Oh, I did. JW: Because you're good like that. WM: I had to turn around and vote, but yes. JW: How many people voted in New York, though? WM: Like 13 percent? JW: And what percent of New York Twitter do you think was complaining about Bodega? WM: 100? JW: Probably. I don't have the math. I don't have the stats. I'm not Nate Silver. But I'm saying, it probably was closer to 100 percent. So, listen up, guys. You want to be mad about some hypothetical startup coming into your hood? WM: You've got a right to be mad. JW: And you've got a right to be mad, but I've got a right to be mad too that y'all didn't vote for the people who are actually making these decisions. WM: No, it's true. Well, I actually think that the real problem with Bodega isn't the business. It's the name Bodega. That's the thing that we've also seized upon with this, which is sort of another thing about this moment, right? It's that we are now in this identity politics phase of being upset about things and it's not what the business is actually going to do to bodegas. It's the fact that it's two guys from Silicon Valley yet again with no idea how the real world works, and they are doing something that is an actual affront to brown people. There is an identity politics issue with this name that you can easily seize upon because it's not the class problem, really. Everybody claims to love their bodega. Let me just say... JW: Nobody loves the $12 olive oil at your bodega that you have to buy because the next bodega is too far and you don't know if they have it and it's cold outside, and you gotta make dinner, so you're just going to fork over the $12. No one loves their bodega. We like the idea that we like our bodegas. WM: Right. The idea — JW: I mean, I do kinda love — my bodega guy meows at me and I kinda love it. But I also, you know. WM: He also tells you you look fly, apparently. JW: And he zips up my dresses and he helps me out. But the idea that a bodega is necessarily going to be put out of business. I mean, the real issues facing bodegas are things like rent control, changing neighborhood demographics, issues with leases, issues with lots of different things. And I would be really sad if that went away. I would be really sad if I couldn't buy beer from a 12 year old anymore, and you know, there's always someone's child manning the register when they shouldn't be, and it's just like part of the fabric of New York and I love it. But the idea that screaming on Twitter about the name of a company — of a hypothetical company that's not coming to your city anytime soon, damn it — and not voting is somehow more effective...yelling on Twitter is more effective than not voting...blows the mind. And it is as indulgent and as privileged and as gentrified as the thing itself. Bodega is part of a larger trend of exorbitantly imagined and priced ideas that are being rolled out and people are adopting, so the idea that this is going to cause — it caused a backlash, but the idea that this is going to somehow put this company out of business I think is really farfetched because let us not forget, we just had the announcement of a $1,000 iPhone. There is a company called Peloton that's basically an individual SoulCycle and the bikes are thousands of dollars, and they're in every startup office, where you just bike — you don't have to go to SoulCycle, you can just hop on the bike and it's WiFi connected and you can like, pedal along like you're in a class. I mean, Uber valet — like we have all of these things already that are catering to those growing upper class of young people who basically are infantilized and just still want to feel like they're in college. It's already happening. But it's not the worst of our problems. WM: It gets worse. I was telling you about this company that wants to be a home mortgage company. And the deal with that is, you don't have enough money for a down payment? By all means, let us give you $50,000. Here's the catch. You have to pay us the money back, and one of the ways you're going to pay that money back is by making sure that for one to three years, one of the rooms in your house is going to be an Air BnB available room. JW: It's the new digital sharecropping. It's indentured servitude to some degree. That's crazy! WM: It's never going to work. JW: Honey, look. It might work. People might do it. These are the times we're living in. This is what I'm saying about reality versus our perception of reality. Let's check back in six months and see. WM: Once again, I have been taken to school by Jenna Wortham. We're going to take a break, we'll be back to talk about some other happy news in the world of what's real and not real and depressing and not depressing. Horror movies! JW: We're going to shove more clowns in the clown car. WM: Yes. We are back. JW: We really have to talk about Mother! WM: We're going to talk about what happens in this movie. There will be some things that might spoil this experience for you. JW: We're going to do our best not to completely spoil it, but it's impossible to talk about this movie in totality without talking about a little bit about how it ends and sort of what some of the theories are behind it. WM: Right. Also, after you see it — and we both think you should see it — you can come back and listen to what you skipped. JW: So, you told me to go see Mother! and okay, alright. Wesley, I love you and I hate you, because I go to this movie, I don't know anything about it. You know I don't like suspense, number one. You know, you've been to the movies with me. You know I don't like suspense. This is the most suspenseful thing. I'm climbing out of the seat. I went with my friend Dodai, and she made me go to AMC 7 because they have the recliner seats. I'm like, lying back, I'm freaking out. There are no spoilers online. I tried to look on my phone, because it's so new... WM: I also think people don't understand what's going on. JW: People don't understand what's going on. I tried to read summaries of it. WM: It's unspoilerable. JW: You know, I just was extraordinarily stressed out. And then at some point, I was like, oh, you're brilliant, and this is why you wanted me to see this, and now I hate you even more because I loved it and I couldn't stop laughing. I never knew what was going to happen. It got crazier and crazier and crazier. It stars Jennifer Lawrence. Love to look at her face. Javier Bardem. Love to look at his face. Michelle Pfeiffer. What a queen. I mean, what a gift unto itself, and she looked amazing and she was so sexy and just, that was the role she was born to play/my future. WM: Drunk suburban mom who drops in? JW: Who refuses to do any housework and just rolls around and wears neon green underwear. WM: And loves Ed Harris. JW: Except for that part. Except for that part. But the neon green undies, boozy drinks during the day, makes fun of Jennifer Lawrence? Sign me up. WM: She was great. This movie, Mother!, is basically the story of a woman in a house, married to a poet, who has got something like writer's block. He's having some sort of trouble getting his next project going. JW: And she appears to be some sort of mystic. Like, it's unclear if she's communicating with this house that they're living in, she's like, every now and again making a little yellow tincture drink and knocking it back. I was just like, sign me up. I love everything about this. WM: Darren Aronofsky, of course, is the director of Requiem for a Dream and Black Swan, and The Fountain and Noah, and his interest in freaking an audience out has everything to do with point of view. Like, he's a subjective filmmaker. He's very much more interested in the life of movies than he is in the life of actual human beings and the ways in which he can mine preexisting texts — in this case, the films of Stanley Kubrick or Luis Buñuel or Gaspar Noe or Roman Polanski...it's really a Rosemary's Baby, what it turns into is a Rosemary's Baby-like movie. That's kind of the vibe of the movie is other people's movies, and the Bible. The Old Testament Bible. Anyway. Ed Harris shows up. He's the first guest. He thinks he is, he's been sent to the wrong house. He's looking for a bed and breakfast, he shows up at Javier Bardem and Jennifer Lawrence's giant Victorian home, the groaning Victorian home, and rather than send him to the place where he was supposed to be going, Javier Bardem's character is a narcissist of infinite proportions and says, please, by all means, come in. Do stay with us. Jennifer Lawrence is like, excuse me? What? And then there's a knock on the door the next day. Then, there's another, there's a woman at the door. Oh, that's my wife, says Ed Harris. And in comes Michelle Pfeiffer. JW: The luminous Michelle...my God. WM: The everything...we should maybe do a whole Michelle Pfeiffer episode. JW: We should. No, I love her to death, my God. WM: So, the two of them come with their — JW: Like, hypersexualized libido and like invasiveness and they've disrupted this idyllic environment that JLaw has like tried to create for them. WM: But there's some tension. There's tension between Javier Bardem and the Jennifer Lawrence character. And the tension has, in Michelle Pfeiffer's character's eyes, to do with the fact that they don't seem to be, what's the love situation like between the two of you? We're so in love. We've got these wonderful kids, and we have a lot of sex, which you can see, because you just walked in on us doing it. Then, there's another knock on the door. And basically, there's one knock after another, and what you begin to see once Michelle Pfeiffer and Ed Harris' kids show up is that this is clearly an allegory for something. You probably knew that two shots into the movie, but this is clearly an allegory for something, and it's clearly based on a very specific — it's based on the Bible, okay. It starts with Genesis. JW: What I will say though is that I spent a lot of time on, you know, our/fan theories — Reddit is still good for something. I spent a lot of time reading about all the various theories, and it is probably Biblical knowing Darren's interests in that, but...we'll get into it in a second, but like, there are a lot of other theories too, we should say. It's not just based on Gensis. WM: No, no, no, there's a lot going on here, and I think once the rollercoaster of crazy really flies off the rails...it really does become more than a strictly Biblical allegory. And what winds up happening of course is Jennifer Lawrence...winds up pregnant, and the pregnancy becomes the focal point of the craziness in the movie. And where that goes...is...really entertaining and totally nuts. JW: Ridiculous to the point of absurdity. And that's when I started to have a really good time, because I was like, oh, we're like completely off the rails. But we should say that this movie has been very polarizing in terms of how people are reviewing it. Some people are like, zero out of four stars! Some people are like, this is a great comedy. Other people are like, WTF. Internet, basically, thinks that this is based on an allegory of the book of Genesis and that Javier Bardem and Jennifer Lawerence's characters are creating this Eden that gets ruined by man, and then all of mankind goes HAM. There was this great thread about how Jennifer Lawerence is actually Lucifer and competing with the poet, aka God, who keeps trying to create something and Lucifer just wants to tempt him away. Which I don't know if that makes sense. I don't know. There are other theories that it's an environmental film, like she's Mother Earth, and the house is being taken over by a greedy man, who just wants more and more and more, and keeps taking things from her. Like, physically taking things from her, ravaging things from her. I was really into those first two theories, and I was all on the Internet and talking about it with my friend Dodai, and then she was like, I think it's just about how men are really selfish and take from women, and I was like, is it just about like, the ego of an artist and maybe Darren is — because he and JLaw are dating, so maybe this is an allegory for their relationship? I mean, what the heck is going on in this movie? WM: First of all, apparently, I've been living under a rock, and did not know that Darren Aronofsky and Jennifer Lawerence were a couple. JW: They've kept it hush hush, but I am up up on all the celeb goss, so I knew. But it's super, super, super on the DL. WM: Not anymore! JW: I mean, the cat's out of the bag. WM: Here's what I think. I think the movie is such a mess that it can be anything you want it to be. Because he's not strictly adhering to this Biblical allegory. And all of the sort of Christian and Old Testament thinking about creation, destruction, greed, sacrifice, all of those things are sort of messily dispersed throughout this movie. And his interest in freaking you out and in showing off what a strong visual director he is...keep upstaging the strength or the tightness of that story. I actually think the funniest metaphor in the movie is the kitchen sink that keeps almost falling off. People keep jumping on the sink and Jennifer Lawerence's character keeps saying... JW: It's not braced! WM: It's not braced! JW: Don't sit on it. WM: So, the kitchen sink, of course, being in critical complaint parlance, everything is in this movie, including the kitchen sink. This movie has everything in it, including a kitchen sink joke. JW: Yeah. WM: The real question is, is Darren Aronofsky funny? Is he a comedic director? And would it have been more fun if, I don't know, Luis Buñuel or John Waters had directed it. I don't know. But I think what makes it extra funny is what is funny about it has gotten away from him. So, we are now laughing kind of with the movie, but mostly at it. And mostly at its like, high pitched, ultra keyed up insanity. And yet, I actually don't think it's crazy enough. JW: I think it could have been crazier. WM: I think it could have been so much crazier. JW: We also didn't say that like, one of the best cameos in the film is Kristen Wiig, which just comes at the height of the lunacy and like, it continues to evolve. It just...like, that's when you know that the joke's on us, the viewer. At least in my opinion. Because you don't cast Kristen Wiig in a movie that's supposed to be serious. Like, she is the epitome of just like, the inside joke. WM: Yes. And something happens to her in this movie that is, I mean, it's just funny. The effects team has a sense of humor too, because the thing that winds up happening to her is just funny. But anyway. One of the other things this movie is about is fame, and about stardom. And in the story about the making of this movie with Darren Aronofsky and Jennifer Lawerence, they talk about this Kardashian room that Jennifer Lawerence had for herself to stay sort of sane when the violence that her character undergoes as the movie goes on...becomes very intense for her as an actress to have to endure. I actually think that there is something about this movie in terms of where it winds up going that is very much about what we as the consumers of culture want from people like Jennifer Lawerence, and what people like Darren Aronofsky think about what we want from people like Beyonce. I mean, the baby aspect of this movie is actually fascinating, right. Because think about the ways in which we have become newly obsessed and creepily and dangerously and unhealthily obsessed with the babies of famous people. JW: Right, physically, like literally, and also metaphorically, like whether it's Lemonade or Blue Ivy or the twins, like, we are... WM: The Kardashian Wests. JW: We just want to consume it all. WM: This movie feels like it's also whether intentionally or not speaking directly to the machine that has to keep this fame going, and these babies are...who knows what's going to end up happening to any of these babies? But there is something, there is something longevity or — I don't know what the term is, but... JW: Well, there's something self perpetuating about it, though, and it becomes this feedback loop in the film, and it's very, you know, the movie ends sort of the way it starts, and you get the sense that they're caught in this hamster wheel of, even though they know how things might end, they keep trying to see if there might be a different outcome, which is actually the definition of insanity, but you get the sense that the movie in some ways is really about the cyclical nature of wants and desires and not being able to resist the things that you know will perhaps eventually destroy you. So, if we look at it from that perspective, so maybe this is a very entertaining slapstick horror movie about the horrors of celebrity. And the dangers inside of it, which actually relates back to the presidency, the current administration. WM: It is definitely meeting up with this moment we're in where we don't actually know what is actually going on outside the movie theater with what's real and not real. Sunday night, at the Emmys, not 20 minutes into the show, Stephen Colbert is doing — I think he's still in his monologue, actually, and at some point, he throws it to Sean Spicer! JW: Not even just live Sean Spicer, but Sean Spicer wheeling the podium that Melissa McCarthy uses to make fun of him on Saturday Night Live. And look, as someone who, I was en route to Charlottesville for a panel on some reporting on Sunday night, I only caught glimpses of it through Instagram, and let me tell you. It was gross. Like, it was not, I was like, I'm not cool with this. The funhouse, I've gotten too deep in the funhouse and I can't find the exit. Like, I don't know what mirror is me and what mirror is play Jenna. I just...it was deeply disturbing, the degree to which people were willing to embrace this person that they'd been denouncing weeks, hours, how many minutes before? WM: And the thing that I always wondered when he was doing his job and lying on behalf of this administration...I actually thought, well, clearly, this guy has nowhere to go when this is over. Like, this guy has almost no viable culture position to maintain. And he will be shunned, he will be the first person to be stoned or something. JW: But will he? Will he? WM: Well, apparently not, because the very people who claimed to have contempt for him...I mean, I just feel like I don't even know how much control Stephen Colbert had in the production of that show... JW: A lot! WM: But it seems to me that it's a real moral abdication to allow Sean Spicer to get the last laugh not of the administration, but on Melissa McCarthy, who is sitting in the audience...her job with that role is done. He's out of a job. She can't play him anymore. He gets to have the last word on the woman who made him interesting in the first place, and who got the most scathing satire performed on him too. JW: And in addition to making him interesting also offered us the first avenue for comedic relief about something that has been an ongoing horror movie, more or less. Like, reality is shape shifting, reality is ephemeral, reality right now is a chameleon. We don't know what's up. We don't know what's down. Things are spiraling and continuing to spiral out of control. And the one thing that we had was grounding was the ability to take a step back and laugh at it a little bit, and that was lost when the Emmys allowed Sean Spicer to be in on the joke that he created the need for. WM: Here is Stephen Colbert throwing it to Sean Spicer at the Emmys. CLIP FROM THE EMMYS WM: Well, basically, what he's doing is playing Melissa McCarthy playing him, in a way, and Melissa McCarthy is sitting there kind of...like, the camera is on her face, and she does not know what to do. JW: I can't believe they didn't tell her. WM: I can't believe they didn't...I mean, I can't believe they didn't tell her. If they didn't tell her...oh, God. That's crazy. Can you imagine? She looked shocked. JW: This is how you know we're in the Truman Show. I need a scene to happen where someone is rowing to the edge of set and can't leave. You know what I mean? WM: But I actually think that's why Mother! is a movie for right now, because we've been talking a lot about Jennifer Lawerence's role as sort of a passive victim and vehicle for the insanity that winds up swallowing her up, but really, it's about Javier Bardem's character, and it's about how nothing can stop what a narcissistic evil a-hole he is. And he's got the crystal. He can always just put the crystal back in the thing, the world resets, and another woman just wakes up in the bed every single time. He's got all the control. JW: All the power. WM: And I feel like this administration is so much like that. Nothing is stopping them from enacting their craziest most insane desires. People leave that administration, and they go on and do whatever they want. I went and say It, based on Stephen King's 1986 novel about a clown that haunts the daylight and nightlife of a group of children in a small town in Maine, and I thought, what a Trump metaphor! But I actually think it's so obvious and easy, and I think really that it is about how we don't want to live with what we're currently living with, and how there is a nostalgia for living in what we think is a simpler time, but I also think that the great thing about Stephen King and the reason we keep going back to him is that he's kind of uncompromising in his vision of what is horrific and what is scary. JW: And also, our inability to acknowledge that the seemingly impossible is possible, and our inability to comprehend that the most bizarre juxtaposition, we can't understand that things can have a duality and there can actually be a lot of evil embedded in something we're conditioned to believe is good. In fact, that's actually where the most evil thing might live, and I think for me, as a child, I read It, which was, I don't know what my parents were doing or thinking, they let me read all of Stephen King when I was like nine years old. It was in the house, like everything else — Danielle Steel, Stephen King, I read it all. Terry McMillan. But you know, aside from — and I have a high tolerance for horror, horror doesn't mess me up. Suspense does. I don't like suspense, I love horror. But the thing I always took away from It was just, you know, we are...we are fallible if we do not acknowledge the thing that is most present and most likely to be a threat. That's our Achilles heel as a society. It feels like the reboot is tapping into that too. WM: Yes. Both these movies to me are speaking to this moment in ways that are sort of maybe even beyond their makers' understanding. JW: Well, sir, that's an extremely generous read on your part to both of those directors who...I can't say for sure, because I'm not living inside their heads like a little John Malkovich character, but look. There's a way in which it could just be a super fun early Halloween, campy, trashy film that you go see because you're bored and you need something to do on date night. There is, you know, a way in which Mother! is also causing a lot of outrage. People are very annoyed that this movie was funded, that this movie was made, that it's getting as much attention as it is. We're in a climate where people feel like there aren't enough stories that are relevant and interesting, especially movies that speak to queer POC perspectives, you know. This movie feels gratuitous in terms of scope and scale and budget and attention, so just to acknowledge that they might have some actual meaningful role to play in our general existential society consciousness is really nice of you. WM: But I think they're doing that anyway. I don't know. I just feel like... JW: Well, that's probably not what they intended. WM: Well...I think sometimes, the best and most lasting movies sort of live beyond what whoever made them intended to do. We should say that the director of It is Andy Muschietti. And I think that...there is a competency at work in both of these movies. I think one, it is too loud and a bunch of other things, but I think they wind up managing to speak to this moment better than you could have hoped. All our consciously trash movies... JW: And society right now is consciously kind of a trash society, so...like attracts like. WM: Right. And for anybody who is misunderstanding what I'm saying, trash, I think, is my favorite type of movie. JW: Ditto. It took me a while to learn that about you, and I'm here for it. I'm into it. WM: Darren Aronofsky makes one trashier piece after the next, and I just really support that. Anyway. That's it. JW: Okay, cool."
0,2017-09-23," Brazil is home to the largest number of uncontacted indigenous communities of any country in the world. Hidden deep in primeval Amazon forests, these groups represent the final frontier of a seemingly inexorable conquest that began with the landing of Portuguese and Spanish navigators on South America's shores at the start of the 16th century. The history of Brazil's Amazon region, as elsewhere in the Americas, abounds with tales of mass death and brutality perpetrated against its native inhabitants. Entire tribes disappeared, many without a trace. Few of these atrocities figured in official accounts; rarely was anyone brought to justice. But 30 years ago, Brazil took an extraordinary step toward halting the march of this dismal history. It recognized the right of its indigenous people to pursue their traditional ways of life, including remaining apart from modern society. It also recognized that they require intact, pristine forests and rivers to survive as they have since before the arrival of Europeans. To that end, the government created a special unit inside Funai, its indigenous affairs agency. The unit was charged with protecting those untrammeled lands and ensuring the viability of the indigenous communities living within them. Field agents who previously sought to woo uncontacted tribes from the bush were assigned a new role: to identify the forests where such tribes live and staff outposts to block intrusions that could threaten the well-being of the native populations. The rights of these tribes — and the government's duty to safeguard them — were enshrined in statutes, international agreements and the country's 1988 Constitution, which remains the law of the land, at least on paper. But Brazil is rapidly backpedaling on these commitments. Severe budget cuts to Funai and the forced retirement of its most seasoned backwoods officials have caused the withdrawal of personnel and the closing of nearly one-third of the control posts that guard access to the territories of isolated tribes across the Amazon. And now Brazilian officials are investigating a massacre believed to have taken place in August on a riverbank deep in the Amazon rain forest. The tribe that suffered this latest atrocity is known as the flecheiros — or Arrow People — a seldom-glimpsed group of hunter-gatherers living in extreme isolation inside the Javari Valley indigenous land, one of a dozen reserves in the Amazon that are home to uncontacted indigenous populations. I am one of few outsiders to see the flecheiros, albeit fleetingly. I trekked through their land on a 10-week expedition through the far reaches of the Javari Valley with Funai in 2002. Officials and indigenous scouts were on a mission to protect the flecheiros, collecting information from their abandoned campsites and monitoring possible threats to their territory, while seeking to avoid direct contact with them. Many of these isolated groups splintered off from larger, now-settled communities, and their cultures are familiar to anthropologists and other experts. But the flecheiros have remained so isolated that we do not know what their ethnicity is, what language they speak or what they call themselves. We do know that they are deft archers who have retreated into one of the Amazon's most inaccessible redoubts, from which they shun all contact with the outside world. This latest incident goes a long way toward explaining their choice. It's also the clearest signal yet that Brazil's failure to uphold its constitutional obligations carries with it lethal consequences. The Javari Valley indigenous land has been a secure bastion for the flecheiros and 15 other isolated tribal groups by dint of its rugged topography and the policies put in place to protect them. Until now. The government outpost on the Jandiatuba River, where the massacre is reported to have occurred, was shut down in 2014 because of budget cuts. Since then, alluvial gold dredges, largely manned by itinerant desperados, have penetrated deep upriver. Some of the prospectors also venture out to hunt bushmeat, and it was such a hunting party that came upon the flecheiros. The miners' reaction apparently was swift and definitive. Had the checkpoint on the Jandiatuba River remained in operation, it's likely this terrible encounter could have been avoided. There would be no gold dredges ransacking the Jandiatuba, one of the principal watersheds that sustain the flecheiros, nor hunters stalking game deep in their forests. As we hiked through the primal homeland of the flecheiros 15 years ago, we found ample evidence that Brazil's policies were working as intended: towering trees dripping with lianas, crystal-clear streams teeming with fish, an astonishing abundance of birds and wild animals, as well as a profound sense of security the flecheiros must have been enjoying. This strategy was the idea of Sydney Possuelo, then a high-ranking Funai official and veteran of dozens of similar treks through the Brazilian jungles. It was Mr. Possuelo, in league with a number of his colleagues, who steered Brazil toward a policy that stands at the confluence of human rights and environmental preservation. ""In protecting the Indians,"" Mr. Possuelo told me as he led our expedition by map and compass, ""you're also protecting vast areas of biodiversity."" These policies have made Brazil a shining example for other countries with isolated tribal societies. Now Brazil stands at a crossroads. It can continue its slow strangulation of Funai, or it can enforce its own laws and reclaim its stature as guardian of its rich cultural and biological diversity. It would be the world's shame — and Brazil's in particular — to stand by and watch, or pretend not to see, as the forces of short-term gain wipe the last human vestiges of pre-European America off the face of the earth."
0,2017-09-25," SAN FRANCISCO — Business leaders in Tucson have tried to mail Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, a 21-foot cactus. The largest conference room in the Tulsa, Okla., mayor's office has been converted to a war room, with 50 volunteers poring over videos of Mr. Bezos. In Philadelphia, hundreds of Wharton Business School students have a new fall semester assignment: Pitch the city to Amazon. And the mayor of Ottawa flew to Seattle last week to walk as close to Amazon's headquarters as is publicly accessible. ""It's like 'The Amazing Race,'"" said Jim Watson, the mayor of Ottawa. ""You've got this cast of characters running toward the Holy Grail."" Amazon, on the hunt for a place to build a second headquarters, where it plans to invest $5 billion and create 50,000 jobs, has begun an enormous competition among cities across North America. With a loose set of requirements like proximity to an airport and walkability, the e-commerce behemoth has set officials on a journey to sell their towns, with the aim of getting in on what some are calling one of the largest economic development deals of the century. That sometimes means going to extreme lengths to draw Mr. Bezos' eye. Is Mr. Bezos impressed? ""We're energized by the response,"" said Adam Sedo, an Amazon spokesman. ""We invited cities to think big, and we are starting to see their creativity."" For Jeff Cheney, the mayor of Frisco, Tex., a city of 160,000 about a half-hour drive from Dallas, the courtship includes offering to build his city around Amazon. ""Our city's only about 60 percent built out, so we've got a lot of available land where we can build to suit,"" Mr. Cheney said. ""We play to win. We're innovators. We're forward thinkers, and we're serious."" City applications are not due until Oct. 19, but Mr. Cheney has already sent a video letter to Amazon. The video opens on him holding an Amazon box and saying, ""Amazon, you're growing your business, and we want to grow with you."" Jerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, is seen talking about catching the ""Frisco Flu,"" which the mayor's office said was a phrase Mr. Jones came up with. Mr. Cheney also gets a Jamba Juice (Jamba Juice is based in Frisco). Mayoral letters to Amazon are actually becoming a YouTube subgenre. Mark D. Boughton, the mayor of Danbury, Conn., posted a video on Sept. 14 calling himself a ""proud Amazon customer"" and asking Alexa, the Amazon virtual assistant, where Amazon should build its second headquarters. ""Danbury,"" a female voice responds. It seems Alexa might be suffering a software glitch, because when Muriel Bowser, the mayor of Washington, posted a video on Sept. 15 asking, ""Alexa, where is the most interesting company in the world going to locate?"" there was a different response. ""Obviously, Washington, D.C.,"" said Alexa. In Canada, the selling point is, well, Canada. ""Amazon has something like 9,000 engineering jobs they can't fill. Our immigration policy is much more liberal,"" said Mr. Watson, Ottawa's mayor. ""That's where we have an advantage."" Another city offering access to Canadian immigration as part of its deal is, surprisingly, Detroit. Working with nearby Windsor, Ontario, which is an eight-minute drive away, Detroit is portraying itself as the best of both worlds. ""There's, you know, the immigration issue — we avoid that,"" said Dan Gilbert, a local business leader in Detroit who was asked by the city's mayor, Mike Duggan, to lead the effort to land Amazon. ""You've got Canada and the U.S. And people will come from all over."" Mr. Gilbert, the founder of Quicken Loans, has also built an Amazon war room, where more than 40 people are trying to analyze what the online retailer ""likes and doesn't like."" They are also trying to read Mr. Bezos' psyche. ""He's got hundreds of hours of videos on YouTube you can watch,"" Mr. Gilbert said. Mr. Gilbert is the largest private property owner in downtown Detroit, and he said he would move his tenants to temporary locations to make room for Amazon so the company did not have to wait for new offices to be built. Competitions for factories or stadiums are typically more private, but this one is playing out in the court of public opinion, said Lauren Hitt, who is managing the public side of the campaign for Philadelphia. ""The competition started that Thursday morning when he announced it,"" Ms. Hitt said of Mr. Bezos. ""The next weeks are basically going to be a sustained campaign."" Philadelphia's effort includes students from the Wharton School writing variations on the very same pitch: why Amazon should come to Philadelphia. This was the school's idea, said Ms. Hitt. Dozens of start-ups have also been asked to submit testimonials about the city's innovation economy and advice on how to approach Amazon. And Philadelphia, which sent a delegation to Seattle last week, is sending a larger delegation this week to ""get into the Jeff Bezos mind-set and ethos,"" Ms. Hitt said. The city would also consider overhauling its tax system for Amazon. ""Having Amazon would mean global things for our tax system,"" Ms. Hitt said. ""We do have business taxes, but that's something that could be looked at in the scope of Amazon coming here."" G. T. Bynum, the mayor of Tulsa, which set up its own Amazon war room in his office, echoed Philadelphia's sentiment on taxes. He said he ""doesn't worry at all"" about tax incentives going too far. ""These are 50,000 jobs with the most innovative company in the world."" ""Whatever it takes,"" he said. Tax policy experts are more skeptical of Amazon's bidding process and how much cities stand to benefit. ""Why are they doing this whole dog and pony show? Amazon wants something for nothing,"" said Matthew Gardner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan think tank. ""They would like a package of tax incentives for something they were going to do anyway."" Art Rolnick, an economist at the University of Minnesota, called Amazon's bidding process — and the broader practice of cities competing for stadiums and factories — ""blackmail."" ""If you look at it from a national perspective, it's zero returns. Minnesota might win one, Wisconsin wins the next one. The company wins each time,"" Mr. Rolnick said. ""It's corporate welfare."" But Mr. Gardner acknowledged that many cities really had no other course than to try to win Amazon. ""If you ask any mayor, they'll say their first job is to bring good jobs to the city,"" he said. ""And Amazon is promising to bring a lot of jobs."" Joe Snell, a business leader with an economic development group in Tucson, was behind the recent shipment to Mr. Bezos of the local saguaro cactus, which he said was symbolic of the region's people. ""It's a hardy plant. It can grow up to 40 feet. And that's Tucson,"" Mr. Snell said. ""We're a community that's growing. We're adaptive. And we're durable."" Amazon said it could not accept gifts but thanked Tucson on Twitter. The company then returned the plant to the city. That was a good outcome for the cactus, which would suffer in the Seattle rain. Still, Mr. Snell had achieved his goal. ""We wanted to cut through the noise, and they definitely noticed it,"" he said. ""And when they choose Tucson, they can come out and experience a million saguaros."""
0,2017-09-27," SEATTLE — Amazon released the first Echo smart speaker three years ago, not long after the company's attempt at a smartphone proved to be a humiliating failure. So far, the results for the Echo have been anything but humiliating. Now, having grown more confident that it understands the fickle market for consumer products, Amazon is making it clear that the Echo and other hardware powered by Alexa, the intelligent assistant behind the devices, present the company with one of its brightest opportunities. On Wednesday, Amazon introduced an array of new Alexa devices that are smaller, less expensive and, in some cases, built for specific areas of the home, including an alarm clock, Echo Spot, that is designed to sit on night stands and desks. Amazon prides itself on its almost pathological focus on what its customers want, rather than what its competitors are doing. But its new Alexa products are clearly a response, at least in part, to new smart speaker offerings from Google and Apple. Amazon is betting that it can defend its franchise by using an old trick — aggressive pricing — and by finding ways to embed Alexa's hooks more deeply into customers' lives. If the strategy works, Amazon could gain an edge in a new wave of computing. Most big technology companies are convinced that voice commands and intelligent assistants will be primary ways that people interact with technology, perhaps more vital than touch screens and keyboards. David Limp, Amazon's senior vice president of devices and services, said Wednesday that the company had about 5,000 employees working on Alexa projects. The company held its event on the 30th floor of one of its high-rise buildings in Seattle, where it had created a living room and kitchen to test how the Alexa devices worked in a homelike setting. The company has identified music, communications and controlling smart home appliances as the most popular uses of Alexa. Although Amazon has not released specific sales figures for Alexa devices, Mr. Limp said tens of millions had been sold. ""They're literally scattering them around the house, putting them in hallways, workshops and garages,"" he said. Echo Spot, a $129.99 spherical device with a 2.5-inch touch screen, is Amazon's version of an alarm clock. In addition to displaying the time and weather, its microphones will allow people to make phone calls, turn lights on and off and ask how long a morning commute will take. A tiny camera makes videoconferencing possible. The device, and its camera, could also provide a test for Amazon. Whether customers feel comfortable having a camera aimed at their beds will depend partially on whether they trust Amazon to protect their privacy. Also introduced Wednesday was an updated version of the original, cylinder-shaped Echo. The new iteration is shorter, with sleeves made of fabric, wood veneer and other materials that allow it to blend in better with the rest of a home's décor. The company said it had improved the device's speakers as well. The biggest change is the price: $99.99 instead of the original Echo's $179.99. Another new device, Echo Plus, resembles the original Echo, but comes with technology that helps control certain household devices like light bulbs that are automated. Echo Plus, priced at $149.99, is designed to find many of those automated devices with little configuration required. A new version of Fire TV, the company's device for streaming internet video to televisions, is small enough to dangle from the back of a television's video port. Amazon said that media companies including Bravo, Netflix and Showtime planned to use a new Alexa capability that lets people use voice commands to control Fire TV video apps. Amazon also said that BMW Group had agreed to embed Alexa in its BMW and Mini Cooper vehicles starting next year, the latest in a series of relationships that Amazon has entered with carmakers to spread the use of Alexa outside the home. Jan Dawson, an analyst at the technology research firm Jackdaw Research said he believed Amazon's goal was to strengthen the loyalty of its customers, especially those enrolled in its Prime membership program. ""Overall, today's announcements felt like Amazon doubling down on its Echo and Alexa strategy,"" he said, adding that the company was ""reminding all of us that it doesn't necessarily need to make money on Echo hardware for the strategy to be successful."" Mr. Dawson said the strategy created ""interesting competitive challenges for others like Google and Apple who don't have such obvious non-hardware revenue streams associated with their smart voice speakers."""
0,2017-09-29," A week into his senior year, the 18-year-old student logged onto Amazon and bought a knife: a spring-loaded switchblade, slim enough to stay hidden in his pocket but sturdy enough, at a price of $30, that it could be lethal. The student, Abel Cedeno, told a friend he felt trapped. Classmates were mocking him with racist and homophobic slurs, he said. Under a Facebook video on Sept. 16 in which he popped the knife open, he asked why people thought he was soft. Detectives believe he started taking the knife to school, a five-story brick building on Mohegan Avenue in the Bronx where some parents worried their children were so unprotected that they had, in the past, taken to patrolling the hallways themselves. That was the prelude to what on Wednesday became the first killing in a New York City public school classroom in two decades, a death that defied steep drops in crime and exposed how vulnerable city classrooms remain to unaddressed bullying and the violence that can follow. During a history class, two classmates started pelting Mr. Cedeno from behind with pencil bits and balled-up paper, the police said. It was the first time the three of them had tangled, but two police officials stressed that it may not have seemed that way to Mr. Cedeno, who told detectives that other classmates had been harassing him since the start of school. He got up and went to the bathroom, but when he returned, the tormenting continued, one of the police officials said. So he stood up, turned around and said something. A teacher, an aide and two dozen other students watched. ""What'd you call me?"" one of the classmates, Matthew McCree, 15, answered. He strode up to Mr. Cedeno and punched him, according to one of the police officials. Mr. Cedeno then pulled out his knife and, with two swings to Mr. McCree's chest and one to his back, killed him, the police official said. Both police officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was continuing. The other classmate, Ariane Laboy, who told detectives he did not yet realize his friend was being stabbed, stepped into the fracas, and Mr. Cedeno sliced him in the biceps, drawing so much blood that Mr. Laboy fainted. Investigators are still building a picture of Mr. Cedeno's life before the fatal confrontation: steady bullying by students he resisted naming in a police interview room; a mother who has been stranded in Puerto Rico by Hurricane Maria; enough difficulties in school that he was older than most of his classmates. But the killing also seems to have taken place amid currents of homophobia, escalating fear and chaotic classrooms, which some parents and students said had been converging for weeks without the school gaining control. Mr. Cedeno identified as bisexual to a small circle of people, a longtime family friend, Savannah Hornback, said. He also struggled with mental health issues, she said, though she declined to go into details. She said he was a homebody who liked playing video games and keeping to himself. Neighbors described him as an ""in-house kid"" who held the door open for them, and said his mother went to Puerto Rico to visit family about a month ago. Ms. Hornback said being Hispanic and being bisexual made Mr. Cedeno a target of nasty slurs from classmates. ""He was constantly taunted at school,"" Ms. Hornback said. ""I guess he felt his only way out of it was to resort to what he did."" Ms. Hornback said Mr. Cedeno's family was not trying to diminish what he did. But she said Mr. Cedeno's mother had pleaded with staff members at the school for help protecting her son and had met with a guidance counselor there. ""There was no action from the school,"" Ms. Hornback said. At a news conference on Thursday morning, the chief of detectives for the New York Police Department, Robert K. Boyce, said Mr. Cedeno did not specifically cite his perceived sexual orientation as a reason he was being bullied or make clear why exactly he had bought the knife. Chief Boyce told reporters that there was no indication Mr. Cedeno himself had complained to school officials about the abuse. Toya Holness, a spokeswoman for the Department of Education, cited a federal student privacy law in declining to comment on whether the school was aware that Mr. Cedeno was being bullied, but she said the department was conducting an investigation. A student who said he witnessed the stabbing, Frankie Santiago, 16, a junior who was friends with Mr. McCree, said, ""The two teachers standing there did absolutely nothing."" He said Mr. McCree had not been bullying Mr. Cedeno and the encounter only grew violent when Mr. Cedeno challenged Mr. McCree to fight. He said Mr. Cedeno overreacted and appeared intent on hurting his two classmates. Ms. Holness declined to discuss the teachers' actions. She said there were no signs of ""staff misconduct"" in the episode. In a statement, the city's schools chancellor, Carmen Fariña, said, ""We have additional safety measures and grief counselors in place and will continue to support the school community."" At a court appearance on Thursday morning in which Mr. Cedeno was formally charged with murder, attempted murder and manslaughter, his lawyer, Deborah Rush, asked that her client be placed on suicide watch and receive a psychological evaluation. Mr. Cedeno signed an order of protection agreeing to avoid contact with Mr. Laboy, 16, who remained hospitalized. Mr. Cedeno was ordered jailed without bail. A prosecutor, Nancy Borko, said at the hearing that Mr. Cedeno had confessed to the attack and to buying the knife. City officials, facing an outcry from parents for not having had metal detectors at the school before, scrambled to put them in place on Thursday. But parents still kept their children home in droves: Less than a third of students at Mr. Cedeno's school, the Urban Assembly School for Wildlife Conservation, and just under half of students at the elementary school that shares the building, Public School 67, attended school on Thursday. Parents said their fears stemmed from a failure by school officials to deal with complaints of bullying. They described students cursing openly in hallways, taunting teachers and leaving condoms and marijuana blunts in the hallways. Kayesha McIntosh, 32, said she once told school officials that students were pulling her daughter's hair. They suggested she put her daughter's hair in a bun. ""Like that was going to stop her from being bullied,"" Ms. McIntosh said. ""They knew she was getting bullied and they didn't do anything."" Feeling abandoned by teachers, she said she visited the parents of one of the offending students herself. Another mother, Jovana Russell, a former PTA president at P.S. 67, said she pulled her daughter from the elementary school after a high school student exposed himself to her in the stairwell several years ago. After parents' requests for more security were turned down, she said, they started patrolling the hallways themselves. Students described feeling as though they had to defend themselves. Some parents said that led to cycles of bullying and violence in which students who were bullied became angry at a lack of action by the school and started threatening other students. There is little indication that the Wildlife Conservation school is one of the most dangerous in the city. But so routine was the trouble that another mother, Uneek Valentin, 37, said that she was having a meeting with the principal about bullying only to have the principal dash out of the office because a fight had broken out in the school. Ms. Valentin's son, Dwhy Hoyt, a senior, said bullies curse at teachers, skip class and slap books out of students' hands, ruining the learning environment. Mr. Hoyt, 17, said he had learned to defend himself, only to be chided by school officials for fighting, and had stopped reporting some incidents. ""I had to fight my own battles and make people into my friend,"" he said."
1,2017-09-29," There are a good number of big-name providers of streaming video-on-demand out there, including iTunes Google Play and Amazon Video, but I've had the most fruitful time with FandangoNow in part because the site, in tandem with its sister app, Fandango, provides a direct bridge between the theatrical and home experiences. Fandango, the movie-ticket purchasing app, is an invaluable tool when I'm seeing a movie socially or have to review something that's not screening in advance for critics. This means I can sign up for alerts to let me know when a film is going to be playing in the most convenient theater for me. When the most desirable option turns up, I buy my ticket — not that these movies are likely to sell out on a Thursday night or Friday morning, but you never know. It certainly helps me keep organized. FandangoNow is also useful when I need to research a sequel or some such thing. For instance, I was recently obliged to review the new movie ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle,"" despite having not seen the 2015 ""Kingsman: The Secret Service,"" the first movie in what now threatens to become a franchise. Fandango is making ""The Secret Service"" available at an attractive rental fee of $1.99 because of the opening of ""Golden Circle."" Similarly, when ""Blade Runner 2049"" opens on Oct. 6, ""Blade Runner: The Final Cut,"" ostensibly the definitive edition of that often-recut 1982 sci-fi classic, will be available for $1.99 rental on FandangoNow. Other sites are not so aggressive in offering sales and rentals of on-demand titles tied to new theatrical releases. For both a film critic and a film buff, the site is a good way to play catch-up with contemporary mainstream fare because its interface is so thoroughly movie-conscious. Currently on my FandangoNow watchlist are the thriller ""A Cure for Wellness"" and the World War II drama ""Their Finest,"" films released this year that I wasn't able to see in theaters, but about which I've heard sufficiently interesting things that I feel I ought to check them out. There is no subscription fee. Fandango was founded in 2000; it was a start-up, backed by a group of movie exhibitors. In the intervening years, it was bought by Comcast, which now also owns NBCUniversal; Warner Bros. Entertainment has a minority ownership of Fandango as well. The movie-review aggregating site Rotten Tomatoes is part of Fandango's corporate family, as is the movie information app Flixster. FandangoNow started in April 2016. Adam Rockmore, Fandango's marketing chief, said the service necessarily retains its independence in spite of its lineage. ""We just moved into a new office at the end of May, and it's completely separate from the other companies,"" he explained in a phone interview. ""We have to serve all the studios and all the exhibitors and so it's important we operate in a discrete way. Similarly, we leave Rotten Tomatoes to do what they do."" Still, Rotten Tomatoes is a presence on the FandangoNow site. You don't have to scroll down too far on the site's home page to find ""200 Essential Movies to Watch Now,"" touting several movies that received Rotten Tomatoes' ""certified fresh"" scores; the top row of the movies offered from $1.99 up features ""The Wizard of Oz,"" ""The Third Man,"" ""Citizen Kane"" and ""All About Eve."" In what may strike some as slightly paradoxical, this à la carte site is actually doing more to promote classic film than Netflix. (In fairness to Netflix, which is more and more often being castigated for its indifference to classic film, the site never sold itself as a portal for any such thing.) FandangoNow, in addition to being a stand-alone video-on-demand transaction site, also wants to be ""a full movie-life-cycle marketer,"" as Mr. Rockmore put it. The ticketing site has an editorial component; on Fandango, the managing editor Erik Davis, whose numerous television appearances present him as an amiably gruff friendly neighborhood movie lover, contributes blog posts; on FandangoNow, Alicia Malone, whose book on women working in film, ""Backwards & In Heels,"" was published earlier this year, contributes an energetic indie movie guide. ""FandangoNow is a retailer, showcasing every movie it has available,"" Mr. Rockmore said. ""The editorial philosophy is that there's a movie for everyone, and the site's editorial function is to play matchmaker."" Granted, but an editorial department whose directive is to like everything runs a substantial risk of being cloying, at the very least. That said, I've found that most of the content on Fandango and FandangoNow is, let's say, agreeable if not better, and well-informed within its chipper mission. The site's editorial side also invites performers and filmmakers to put together recommendation lists. Of course, like most other such sites, recommendations are algorithmed, so to speak, based on past purchases. Fandango does remarkably well in the ticket-selling business. Its sales accounted for more than 25% of the opening weekend box office of ""Wonder Woman."" Blockbuster seasons aren't the only good time for the operation. During the coming awards season, Fandango and FandangoNow can promote Golden Globe and Oscar contenders both in theaters and beyond. Mainstream entertainment mavens can love that kind of synergy."
0,2017-09-30," Amazon is often promoting the idea of improving the world. Therefore its second headquarters should do that. Knowing that it is a game changer, Amazon should go to a Rust Belt city and forever alter the economy of the region. Take a good look at Pittsburgh or Cleveland. Both have had a renaissance and offer lovely downtowns, beautiful architecture, great waterfronts, beautiful parks, treelined streets, excellent cultural amenities, great public transportation and pro sports teams. Even better, they have great colleges and medical facilities. They both have all the things Seattle has except mild winters and a cool reputation. If you want pleasant weather, then Atlanta or Raleigh, N.C. But if you want a classic city where you can stretch out, Pittsburgh and Cleveland offer it all. DAVID MARCUMHUNTINGTON, W.VA.  Research Triangle Park in North Carolina was established in 1959 as a hub for high tech-related companies to get the benefits of agglomeration. It's in a triangle formed by Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill, with North Carolina's major universities nearby. It hosts major headquarters of companies like IBM and Cisco, plus numerous drug companies. Perfect for an Amazon headquarters. STEVE BARSBY, CARY, N.C.  Somers, N.Y., is a bucolic gem in upper Westchester County and former home to IBM and Pepsi. The stunning IBM campus, designed by I. M. Pei, sits on 723 acres of open land. The stress-free surroundings, great public schools and hometown atmosphere make it the perfect choice for Amazon. Manhattan is only about 70 minutes away by Metro-North. There are wonderful restaurants, as well as hiking, biking, fishing and cultural venues (like Caramoor) to explore. Please consider this beautiful location for your HQ2. JILL HANO, SOMERS, N.Y.  I am a longtime Seattle resident, and my advice to cities vying for Amazon is to be careful what you wish for. The average tenure at Amazon is about one year. The result: an influx of transient, well-paid workers that has turned Seattle into a city of horrendous traffic and outrageously expensive housing that has lost its quirky, middle-class character. Thanks to Amazon's rampant development without accompanying transportation infrastructure, it is an ordeal to cross town at any hour of the day. The city is now unaffordable for young families, and the flight to the suburbs is accelerating. Cities should consider exactly who will benefit from those high-paying jobs at Amazon. NANCY ANDERSONSEATTLE  If I were a prospective employee of Amazon, I would like nothing better than to work in New Haven, Conn. New Haven has a strong cultural presence, with theaters, museums, concert venues and an annual arts festival. Yale University anchors the lively downtown, full of bookstores, cafes, restaurants and pubs. The city has its own small airport and is a convenient drive to Hartford's international airport. Amtrak trains stop in New Haven; Metro-North trains connect to Manhattan. Connecticut, a progressive state with an open-minded, welcoming population, is a delightful place to live and raise a family. ANNE-MARIE SUTTONMILFORD, CONN.  Clearly the best choice for Amazon HQ2 is Atlanta, for many reasons. Geographically ideal: the opposite end of the country from the current HQ. Fantastic airport. Great people, well educated and diverse. Fairly mild weather all year long. Low cost of living compared with many other major metropolitan areas. Excellent entertainment options (sports, music, night life, restaurants) and world-class shopping. Having lived here for nearly 14 years as a nonnative, I can really appreciate the many ways this city outshines its competitors. SUSAN BERLIN, ATLANTA  A Sept. 11 Upshot article concluded that the Denver metro area is the ideal place for the new Amazon headquarters. Fabulous. The problem is we do not desperately need Amazon. Colorado has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country and a metro filled with great arts, sports and entertainment. If Amazon wants to do good for our country, it should build its new mecca in Columbus, Ohio, or Lexington, Ky., or some other city that is in desperate need of an infusion of growth and new energy. There would be no better monument to Jeff Bezos and the power of Amazon than to take a struggling location and turn it into a winner. NORMA MOOREBOULDER, COLO.  My pitch for Baltimore is very simple. 1) Amazon could have a genuinely transformative effect on the city — the need is great; 2) Baltimore has a well-educated population, walkable downtown and functioning infrastructure; and 3) the symbolism of investing in the city most symbolic of our nation's divides would send a powerful message that the country sorely needs. Baltimore, in short, occupies the sweet spot at the intersection of need, ability and regenerative possibility. There is no better place to invest in our nation's future. PAUL T. MCCARTNEYBALTIMORE  As a book author, I've had ongoing headaches with Amazon. I propose that Amazon put its new headquarters in the South Pole-Aitken basin on the dark side of the moon. It is very spacious, 1,600 miles in diameter — so big it can be shared with Walmart. Perhaps if we can remove those companies from the face of the earth we can get our nice little local bookstores and other retail outlets back. This will improve our local economies and hopefully provide decent-paying jobs for our neighbors. MARTHA SHELLEYPORTLAND, ORE.  While we cannot top the foggy lattes of Seattle, sunny San Antonio has a lot to offer, and that goes well beyond our world-famous River Walk. Our charming and storied history complements the new and rapid growth of our talented work force, which now numbers over one million in the metropolitan area. We have tens of thousands of employees in the tech industry, and our robust stock of affordable housing can easily house the young talent your team needs. So, Jeff Bezos, come discover why so many more people are calling the Alamo City home, and how Amazon fits perfectly into our pro-business, pro-Tex-Mex environment. DANNY KHALILSAN ANTONIO The writer is research and policy analyst for Centro San Antonio, the city's nonprofit downtown partnership.  Dear Amazon: We invite you to Boston, a dense, bustling, modern yet historic city. We offer a deep talent pool continuously enriched by a constellation of colleges, natural beauty, a vibrant cultural life, and attractive housing for your employees, from executives to staff. We will give you no tax breaks, no free public land and no environmentally harmful zoning favors, all of which would, in the long run, reduce the quality of life in the city you would call home. We will be business-friendly, not by disrupting the workings of the private market, in which you have been so successful, but by investing our resources in infrastructure, education and other public services that will make Boston an ever better place for you, and others, to work, to live and to enjoy. Amazon thinks ahead. So does Boston. SHIRLEY KRESSELBOSTON  Amazon should establish its second headquarters in St. Louis. Not only does St. Louis have the key attributes Amazon is seeking — a willing and able city administration, available work force, affordable real estate, key educational institutions and more — but St. Louis also needs Amazon. When St. Louis makes the news it is often bad news. But a strong, socially conscious employer like Amazon could make a big difference. St. Louis needs good jobs for the people and for the economy. A stronger tax base will allow schools to improve and attract other investors to help lift people out of the poverty that underlies crime. Amazon can go to Dallas, Austin or Denver and slip right into an already strong economy and make little difference to the community. In St. Louis, Amazon would turn this city around. St. Louis needs Amazon; please come here! KATHERINE SWALLERST. LOUIS"

0,2017-10-03," BRUSSELS — European Union officials will order Luxembourg to collect back taxes from the online retail giant Amazon, a source with knowledge of the decision said Tuesday, the latest in a series of moves where Brussels has sought to flex its regulatory muscle over Silicon Valley. The decision, which will be announced on Wednesday, comes as European authorities consider a raft of proposals aimed at increasing the amount of tax paid by American technology companies. The regulatory push, combined with the prospect of tax reforms, have fueled accusations that the European Union is unfairly targeting the United States tech sector. E.U. officials have denied those claims. It was not clear how much Luxembourg would be ordered to reclaim, according to the source, who did not want to be identified discussing information that was not yet public. Officials in Luxembourg and the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, declined to comment. The ruling mirrors a similar order from the commission last year, directing Ireland to reclaim 13 billion euros, or $15.2 billion at current exchange rates, in back taxes from Apple. The actions have highlighted the heightened scrutiny faced by low-tax nations in the European Union. Those countries, critics argue, help multinationals funnel revenues from larger markets in order to lower their overall tax bill. Such behavior has infuriated larger countries like France, whose budgets have been squeezed in recent years. The investigation into Luxembourg's handling of Amazon was made public in 2014, and the commission issued a preliminary finding the following year. In it, it described how the retailer used subsidiaries in Luxembourg to reduce its overall tax obligations. At the time, the commission said that, in a deal struck in 2003, authorities in Luxembourg had conferred ""an advantage on Amazon."" The commission added that the ""advantage is obtained every year and ongoing,"" and that it ""is also granted in a selective manner."" Amazon does business across the 28-nation bloc, but lists its European headquarters as Luxembourg, a tiny country with a population of around 500,000. The agreement between Amazon and Luxembourg effectively capped the amount of tax Amazon paid, and relied on a method called transfer pricing, according to the commission. Transfer pricing has long been used by multinational companies to assign profits to different units, depending on factors like their role in the overall business and assets. But, according to the commission, these rules are harder to apply for technology companies, because their assets, like intellectual property, are intangible. European regulators have claimed that Amazon sent most of its European revenue from one unit in Luxembourg to a separate subsidiary that was not liable to pay corporate tax in the country. As a result, it was able to reduce the profit it generated from its European operations and cut its tax bill, the commission said. It is not illegal in the European Union for countries to try to lure businesses with low tax rates. But offering special deals to companies that are not available to their competitors can amount to what is known as illegal state aid. Both Amazon and Luxembourg's finance ministry have previously denied that the online retail giant received special tax treatment or benefits. Amazon has already been in the commission's cross hairs this year for unfair competition. In May, the company reached an agreement with Brussels over its e-books business after a two-year investigation. Margrethe Vestager, the European Union's competition commissioner, had said certain clauses in Amazon's contracts may have made it more difficult for other e-book platforms to innovate and compete effectively with Amazon. The retailer said it would drop the clauses. And in January, Amazon agreed with Brussels to end an exclusive deal to supply Apple with audiobooks. Brussels said that step also was likely to improve competition in the bloc. The cases against Amazon are among several in which the commission has targeted American technology companies. European Union officials are investigating Google and Qualcomm over possible abuses of their dominant market position, while regulators in various countries have investigated Facebook over its handling of customers' data. Efforts to curb multinationals from dodging tax have risen in prominence in recent months. Last month, the European Union began considering new proposals broadly aimed at tax internet companies in the countries where they generate their business, rather than allow them to shift profits to jurisdictions with lower rates. Luxembourg has been a particular target of increased scrutiny. In 2015, Ms. Vestager imposed an order on Luxembourg to claw back about €30 million from a Fiat Chrysler unit. A decision in a case considering Luxembourg's treatment of McDonald's is also still pending. The prominence of Luxembourg has put Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, in an awkward position: his role includes oversight of the investigations yet his critics accuse him of having helped turn Luxembourg into a tax haven during his nearly two decades leading that country."

2,2017-10-04," BRUSSELS — European competition regulators on Wednesday mounted a push against tax avoidance by Silicon Valley giants, announcing plans to take Ireland to court for failing to collect back taxes from Apple and ordering Luxembourg to claim unpaid taxes from Amazon. The effort, which comes as the European Union considers proposals meant to increase the sums levied on technology companies, is part of a concerted campaign to revamp how taxes are collected in the 28-nation bloc. Officials in Europe have been particularly focused on flexing their regulatory muscles against American technology companies, including assessing penalties for antitrust violations and opening investigations into the mishandling of customer data. Critics have argued that the measures show that the European Union is unfairly targeting such companies — an accusation that officials in Europe deny. The moves to address tax avoidance have special resonance in the region, much of which has endured painful austerity measures stemming from the financial crisis. Opponents of those measures complain that big companies have skirted their tax obligations, leaving small firms and individuals to make up the difference. European officials are increasingly trying to counter that narrative. On Wednesday, Margrethe Vestager, the European Union's competition commissioner, ordered Luxembourg to collect around 250 million euros, or about $293 million, in unpaid taxes from Amazon. The ruling was tied to an agreement between the country and the company that the European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, said dated to 2003. The order resembles a similar move the commission made last year, when it directed Ireland to reclaim around $15.2 billion from Apple. Ireland fears that such a decision could make it a less attractive place for multinational companies. In a sign of the disquiet in Dublin about that order, the Irish government failed to meet a January deadline to collect the money. It has appealed the ruling. That earned Ireland a forceful rebuke from Ms. Vestager. A year later, ""Ireland has not recovered any money, not even in part,"" she said, warning the country to accelerate its efforts to avoid ""more conflictual waters,"" a reference to the prospects for a lengthy court battle. Although litigation to force Ireland to recoup the taxes could drag on for years, the commission has successfully sued countries in the past and punished them with large fines for failing to recover money from companies that received illegal state aid. At the time of the ruling, Europe's competition watchdogs said that Apple's arrangements with Dublin were illegal and had ensured the iPhone maker paid virtually nothing on its European business in some years. Brussels argued that the deals allowed Apple to funnel profit from two Irish subsidiaries to an office in which it had ""no employees, no premises, no real activities."" The Irish Department of Finance said that it ""has never accepted the commission's analysis"" in the Apple case and that it was taken aback by Ms. Vestager's decision to take the country to court. The department said it had ""made significant progress on this complex issue"" and accused the European authorities of taking a ""wholly unnecessary step."" Apple did not immediately comment on the latest move, but has criticized the ruling in the past. The original decision has also drawn the ire of the United States Treasury Department. In the case of Amazon, the commission said Wednesday that Luxembourg had reduced its tax bill for more than eight years, from 2006 to 2014, and had conferred on the company a selective advantage. The arrangement essentially capped the amount of tax that the retailer paid, and relied on a method known as transfer pricing. Typically, transfer pricing has been used by companies to assign revenues and profits to different business units depending on their location, role in the overall company and assets. But that system is harder to police with technology companies because many of their biggest assets, like intellectual property, are intangible. The European Commission said that Amazon had abused this system by sending most of its European revenue to a Luxembourg subsidiary that was not liable to pay corporate tax, helping the company cut its overall bill. Ms. Vestager said the arrangement had ""no valid economic justification"" and that the company had been able to ""avoid taxation on almost three quarters of the profits it made from all Amazon sales in the E.U."" Amazon and Luxembourg have denied the charges. ""We believe that Amazon did not receive any special treatment from Luxembourg,"" the company said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that it ""paid tax in full accordance with both Luxembourg and international tax law."" Amazon said it would study the commission's ruling and was considering whether to appeal. In a statement, Luxembourg's finance ministry also contested Ms. Vestager's ruling. ""As Amazon has been taxed in accordance with the tax rules applicable at the relevant time, Luxembourg considers that the company has not been granted incompatible state aid,"" it said. It is not illegal in the European Union for member states to attempt to lure businesses by lowering corporate tax rates. But, as with Amazon's agreement with Luxembourg, offering special deals to select companies that are not made available to rivals can amount to ""illegal state aid."" The investigations are among several in which commission officials have looked into the affairs of Silicon Valley companies. Regulators in Brussels are challenging Google and Qualcomm over alleged antitrust violations, and officials in various countries have investigated Facebook over its handling of customers' data. Ms. Vestager has made taxes a priority of her term as Europe's competition commissioner. In that time, she has penalized Starbucks in the Netherlands and Anheuser-Busch InBev in Belgium. But Luxembourg has been a particular target: In 2015, she told the country to claw back about €30 million from a Fiat Chrysler unit, while a case considering Luxembourg's treatment of McDonald's is also continuing. ""I don't think that we're done,"" Ms. Vestager said on Wednesday, adding that new laws were also necessary. ""The main part of the solution is of course that we have legislation that gives you a transparent tax landscape and enables national tax authorities to do their job."" A broader overhaul may be afoot. The European Commission published proposals last month under which internet companies would be taxed in the countries where they generated revenue. Such a shift would mean the companies could not move their profits to jurisdictions with lower taxes. A push in that direction could, however, prove complicated and carries several risks, said Clemens Fuest, the director of the Ifo Institute for Economic Research, a prominent think tank in Germany. In particular, European governments still might devise a host of new incentives to lure investment, while legislative changes at the European level could prompt retaliation by major trading partners. ""There are real dangers if Brussels keeps acting unilaterally,"" Mr. Fuest said. The European Union stepped up efforts to curb tax avoidance by companies and by individuals after the financial crisis, which forced many of the bloc's member states to cut public services and raise tax rates. But opponents of the austerity programs argued that big corporations had not faced the same pressures, partly because they have long been able to shift their profits to low-tax countries."
0,2017-10-05," Mattel announced on Wednesday that it was canceling plans to bring to market a smart device called Aristotle, which was aimed at children from infancy to adolescence and was set to hit stores in 2018. The decision came after child advocacy groups, lawmakers and parents raised concerns about the impact the artificial intelligence device could have had on children's privacy, development and well-being. A petition asking Mattel not to release Aristotle, started in May by the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood and the Story of Stuff Project, garnered more than 15,000 signatures and argued that babies and older children shouldn't be encouraged to form bonds with data-collecting devices. Last month, Senator Ed Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, also sent a letter to Mattel in which they wrote: ""This new product has the potential to raise serious privacy concerns as Mattel can build an in-depth profile of children and their family. It appears that never before has a device had the capability to so intimately look into the life of a child."" Alarm bells first rang among industry insiders when Mattel unveiled Aristotle in January. The voice-activated Wi-Fi device with a companion camera was billed as a ""first-of-its kind connected kids room platform"" that was designed to ""comfort, entertain, teach, and assist during each development state — evolving with a child as their needs change."" The product, based on the technology of Amazon's Alexa, boasted features such as the ability to soothe a crying baby, teach A B C's, reinforce good manners, play interactive games and help kids with homework. Marketed as an ""all-in-one nursery necessity"" on Mattel's website, it also offered e-commerce functionality that would enable Aristotle to automatically reorder baby products based on user feedback. ""One of the things that was so striking about this device is that we had so many different concerns. First of all, when you have a device with a camera and a microphone that's going to be in young children's bedrooms, there is the potential to collect so much data on children that can be used and shared with advertisers and retailers,"" said Josh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood. ""Then there are all these child development concerns about replacing essential parenting functions with a device."" A spokeswoman for Mattel said that the decision not to bring Aristotle to the marketplace was prompted by new leadership in the company. She said that Sven Gerjets, the company's new chief technology officer, ""conducted an extensive review of the Aristotle product and decided that it did not fully align with Mattel's new technology strategy."" Mattel's recent announcement was met with praise. ""This is a huge victory for everyone who believes that corporate profits and experimentation should never come at the expense of children's privacy and well-being,"" Mr. Golin said. ""We commend Mattel for listening to the child development experts and thousands of parents who told them a child's bedroom should be free of corporate surveillance and that essential caregiving functions should never be outsourced to robots."" Aristotle wasn't the first electronic device to come under fire — Mattel also was criticized when it released the Wi-Fi interactive Hello Barbie in 2015 — and it very likely won't be the last. James Steyer, founder and chief executive of the nonprofit organization Common Sense, noted that breaches to children's privacy can and do happen. For instance, the game and toy manufacturer VTech experienced a breach in 2015 in which nearly five million parent accounts and six million student accounts were compromised, including names, emails, addresses, usernames and passwords. Even though Aristotle didn't make it to market, Mr. Steyer said he is concerned that ""the next version will look more like a toy — say, placed inside a cute teddy bear — and then it will be 2018's must-have present, followed shortly thereafter by security issues that either researchers or hackers will discover."" Beyond the privacy concerns, Sherry Turkle, director of the M.I.T. Initiative on Technology and Self and author of ""Reclaiming Conversation,"" said that the progression of increasingly advanced products with humanlike capabilities can cause irreparable harm to young minds. ""The ground rules of human beinghood are laid down very early,"" she said. And what she calls ""intimate machines"" have ""changed the ground rules of how people think about personhood."" The stakes, according to Dr. Turkle, couldn't be higher. ""This is not at all an anti-technology position. This is about a particular kind of technology, one that pretends empathy,"" Dr. Turkle said. ""We can't put children in this position of pretend empathy and then expect that children will know what empathy is. Or give them pretend as-if relationships, and then think that we'll have children who know what relationships are. It really says a lot about how far we have gone down the path of forgetting what those things are."" Dr. Dimitri Christakis, co-author of the American Academy of Pediatrics' 2016 media guidelines for children under 6, said he is ""constantly dismayed by how much we are technologizing childhood"" and believes it contributes to our dependency on digital devices. As for the Aristotle, Dr. Christakis said: ""I am not a fan. More to the point, Aristotle himself would not be. He said, among other things, 'Good habits formed at youth make all the difference.'"" Dr. Christakis said that beginning in infancy, children need not only the warmth of human interaction but also to learn to be alone and soothe or entertain themselves — without the constant presence of a digital device. ""I'm glad that there was sufficient uproar and that this product went away, but it's not the last time we'll see such things."""
1,2017-10-05," A personal shopper is something you might expect at Bergdorf Goodman or a boutique on Madison Avenue. Not at the Walmart on Route 42 in Turnersville, N.J. But that's where you will find Joann Joseph and a team of Walmart workers each day, filling up shopping carts with boxes of Honeycomb cereal, Cheez-Its and salted peanuts. The customers select their groceries online, and then the shoppers pick the items off the store shelves and deliver them to people when they arrive in the parking lot. Customers never have to step inside the store. ""It's about saving people time,"" Ms. Joseph said as she helped load groceries into the back of a minivan one morning. Walmart, which is one of the largest food retailers in the United States, sees grocery pickup as a way to marry its e-commerce business with its gigantic network of stores — a goal that has eluded many other retailers. The company started ramping up the service two years ago, and it is now available in about 1,000 of Walmart's 4,699 stores across the country. The initiative is the latest salvo in Walmart's retail battle with Amazon, and the centerpiece of its strategy to gain the upper hand in the pursuit of consumers looking to streamline their food shopping. Many retailers are focused on new ways to deliver groceries to people's homes — particularly in big cities. Walmart is betting big on the millions of Americans in suburban and rural areas who drive everywhere. The company is trying to make ordering groceries online and then picking them up in your car as seamless as a fast-food drive-through. Groceries have become one of the most fiercely contested areas of retail. Amazon upped the ante in June with its $13.4 billion purchase of Whole Foods, giving it a major foothold in the industry. Lidl, the German supermarket chain, is also making a big push to open stores in the United States. Grocery delivery companies like Fresh Direct have spawned a contest among traditional grocers and start-ups to offer faster home delivery. Amid this heated competition, Walmart has been experimenting with different ways to get an edge. In a few cities, it works with Uber to deliver groceries to homes. And last month, Walmart said it would begin testing a home-delivery service in which a worker loads the food into the refrigerator, even when no one is home. The customer can watch the process remotely from a home security camera and track when the delivery worker enters and leaves the house. While these initiatives are limited to only a few states, the company's grocery pickup is widespread. Walmart is betting that a big part of the country (""from Scranton to Sacramento,"" one Walmart executive said) is more of a drive-through than delivery culture. There is a risk that Walmart's new grocery strategy could undercut its sales of other products. Selling groceries has lower profits, but it brings customers into the store regularly, allowing Walmart to push bigger-ticket items. ""That is the philosophy of the Supercenter: You put all these other categories under one roof,"" said Gene German, a professor emeritus of food marketing at Cornell University. ""So if the customers don't go into the stores, that could be a negative."" But Walmart believes that the ""high touch"" approach of online grocery ordering is improving people's opinion of the shopping experience at its stores, making them more likely to purchase general merchandise in addition to food. ""We get feedback and how much they appreciate the time that we take"" in fulfilling a grocery order, said Mike Turner, a vice president of Walmart's e-commerce operations, said in an interview. Walmart does not disclose its online grocery sales. But when the company reported its second-quarter results in August, it said online sales, including grocery, had increased 60 percent from a year earlier. The company also indicated that overall food sales growth had been the best in five years.  For decades, Walmart was seen as the world's foremost innovator in retail. But even as the company has become the world's largest retailer, it has been overshadowed in many ways by Amazon's rapid growth and many advancements. Amazon's long-term strategy for Whole Foods, however, is not clear. Amazon must figure out how to sync its core online business and warehouse network with more than 460 Whole Foods stores, many of which are in high-priced urban areas and can be costly to operate. Walmart faces a different set of challenges and opportunities with its online grocery pickup — which were on display at the Supercenter in Turnersville, outside Philadelphia. The strategy's promise is that Walmart can uses its thousands of stores as mini-fulfillment centers, while also avoiding the costs of home delivery. But the store does not always function like a warehouse. One morning, Ms. Joseph walked through the aisles, pushing a cart and scrolling through a hand-held device that listed the order a customer had placed online. Like GPS services for cars, her device mapped out the most efficient route: She grabbed a box of Honeycomb in one aisle then a box of Lipton Berry Tea in another. But when Ms. Joseph reached the peanut aisle, she hit a snag. The customer had ordered a five-pack of individual-size servings of salted peanuts. There were no more individual-size packs. She checked the candy and snack displays at the cash registers, but there were none there, either. So Ms. Joseph improvised. Borrowing a colleague's iPhone, she calculated the amount of peanuts in the pack of individual servings, and then she selected a jug of peanuts with comparable volume. ""Your instinct needs to kick in,"" Ms Joseph said. ""And you go with it."" Each substitution is supposed to be clearly marked with a sticker so the customer is not surprised. Customers order their groceries online and then can pick them up at the store, a few hours later during a certain time window. Walmart is also showering grocery pickup customers with perks — Easter eggs hidden in grocery bags, a ""beauty box"" for moms at Mother's Day, dog biscuits and discounts for recruiting new customers. It's unclear how the company will be able maintain this kind of dedicated service if a store is inundated with pickup orders, which in many stores are free of charge and require an order of $30 or more. Walmart said it had hired thousands of workers to staff the new service across its many stores. ""This is something Walmart could get into easily and quickly,"" Mr. German said. ""And it would send a message to shareholders: We are not going to be passive. We are going to be proactive."" Customers who order online choose a one-hour window in which they can pick up their groceries. When they arrive at the Walmart parking lot, they pull into designated grocery pickup spots, which at some stores resemble a gas station with a canopy overhead. Minutes later, a personal shopper emerges from the store with bags of groceries. When Laura Rothwein of Clayton, N.J., pulled up in her minivan to the side of the Turnersville store, the personal shoppers greeted her 6-year-old son with a treat from the bakery and a bottle of red Gatorade. A short time later, Sherri Arrison, a retiree, arrived in her Nissan Murano. One personal shopper loaded groceries into the back, while another held out a bright orange umbrella to shelter the food from the rain. ""This is pretty much the only way I shop now,"" Ms. Arrison said. ""I don't have to go into the store and keep walking around."""
0,2017-10-07," ""You are going to have a chance to play with Alexa,"" I told my daughter, Grace, who's 3 years old. Pointing at the black cylindrical device, I explained that the speaker, also known as the Amazon Echo, was a bit like Siri but smarter. ""You can ask it anything you want,"" I said nonchalantly.  Grace leaned forward toward the speaker. ""Hello, Alexa, my name is Gracie,"" she said. ""Will it rain today?"" The turquoise rim glowed into life. ""Currently, it is 60 degrees,"" a perky female voice answered, assuring her it wouldn't rain. Over the next hour, Grace figured out she could ask Alexa to play her favorite music from the film ""Sing."" She realized Alexa could tell jokes, do math or provide interesting facts. ""Hey, Alexa, what do brown horses eat?"" And she soon discovered a whole new level of power. ""Alexa, shut up,"" she barked, then looked a little sheepish and asked me if it was O.K. to be rude to her. So she thought the speaker had feelings? By the next morning, Alexa was the first ""person"" Grace said hello to as she bounded into the kitchen wearing her pink fluffy dressing gown. My preschooler who can't yet ride a bike or read a book had also quickly mastered that she could buy things with the bot's help, or at least try to. ""Alexa, buy me blueberries,"" she commanded. Grace, of course, had no idea that Amazon, the world's biggest retailer, was the corporate behemoth behind the helpful female assistant, and that smoothing the way when it came to impulse buys was right up Alexa's algorithmic alley. Grace's easy embrace of Alexa was slightly amusing but also alarming. My small experiment, with my daughter as the guinea pig, drove home to me the profound shift in our relationship with technology. For generations, our trust in it has gone no further than feeling confident the machine or mechanism will do what it's supposed or expected to do, nothing more, nothing less. We trust a washing machine to clean our clothes or an A.T.M. to dispense money, but we don't expect to form a relationship with them or call them by name. Today, we're no longer trusting machines just to do something, but to decide what to do and when to do it. The next generation will grow up in an age where it's normal to be surrounded by autonomous agents, with or without cute names. The Alexas of the world will make a raft of decisions for my kids and others like them as they proceed through life — everything from whether to have mac and cheese or a green bowl for dinner to the perfect gift for a friend's birthday to what to do to improve their mood or energy and even advice on whom they should date. In time, the question for them won't be, ""Should we trust robots?"" but ""Do we trust them too much?"" With some trepidation, I watched my daughter gaily hand her decisions over. ""Alexa, what should I do today?"" Grace asked in her singsong voice on Day 3. It wasn't long before she was trusting her with the big choices. ""Alexa, what should I wear today? My pink or my sparkly dress?"" In April, Amazon unveiled the Echo Look, a $199 Alexa add-on that features a hands-free selfie camera controlled by your voice. The device doesn't just hear you, it sees you. According to Amazon, the Style Check feature uses ""machine-learning algorithms with advice from fashion specialists"" to judge different outfits, awarding them an overall rating to decide which is ""better"" based on ""current trends and what flatters you."" The images it takes of you happen to be stored in the Amazon Web Services cloud until you delete them. And while the fashion-savvy assistant helps you decide what to wear, it has an ulterior motive: to sell you clothing, including choices from one of Amazon's own apparel lines, such as Lark & Ro and North Eleven, started in 2016. It's these kinds of intersections – like this small collision between robot ""helpfulness"" and a latent commercial agenda — that can make parents like me start to wonder about the ethical niceties of this brave new bot world. Alexa, after all, is not ""Alexa."" She's a corporate algorithm in a black box.  Grace doesn't like it when I tell her what to wear. How would she feel about Alexa judging her? Would she see it as helpful or crushing? This could well be one of our parenting tasks in the near future — preparing our children for the psychological repercussions of such personal interactions with computer ""people."" Still, the next generation is likely to feel very differently about machines than we do. In a study conducted by M.I.T. Media Lab, 27 children, aged between 3 and 10, interacted with A.I. devices and toys including Alexa, Google Home, Julie (a chatbot) and, finally, Cozmo (a robot in the form of a toy bulldozer). The researchers asked the children how they felt about the devices in terms of intelligence, personality and trust. The younger children seemed to see the agents as real people and asked them personal questions: ""Hey, Alexa, how old are you?"" and ""What are you?"" Some thought the device had multiple personalities. ""She doesn't know the answer,"" said one child, wisely. ""Ask the other Alexa."" Almost 80 percent of the children thought Alexa would always tell the truth. Some of the children believed they could teach the devices something useful, like how to make a paper plane, suggesting they felt a genuine, give-and-take relationship with the machines. How do we teach our children to question not only the security and privacy implications but also the ethical and commercial intentions of a device designed by marketers? Our kids are going to need to know where and when it is appropriate to put their trust in computer code alone. I watched Grace hand over her trust to Alexa quickly. There are few checks and balances to deter children from doing just that, not to mention very few tools to help them make informed decisions about A.I. advice. And isn't helping Gracie learn how to make decisions about what to wear — and many more even important things in life — my job? I decided to retire Alexa to the closet."
0,2017-10-10," I promise I'm not bragging. I know it might seem like I am, but I'm not. I never asked to film a three-way sex scene for TV. But that's what happened this past year. No big deal, just part of my job. What's your job? If you don't know my name, you might know my face. I'm one of those actors who pop up in a lot of different TV shows and movies. Sometimes people stop me in airports and make me list things they might watch until they can place me. It's an odd game. Let's play: ""Childrens Hospital""? ""The League""? ""The Office""? ""I Love You, Man""? ""The Descendants""? Inconsiderate Cell Phone Man (an old commercial)? Still nothing? Did we go to high school together? One of my favorite jobs is playing Len on Amazon's ""Transparent."" I'm the ex-husband of Sarah Pfefferman (Amy Landecker) on the show. I know, I know: ""Those Pfefferman kids are so selfish and unlikable!"" Well, who wants to spend time with likable people anyway? If you're behind on the show, allow me to catch you up (spoilers ahead). Way back in Season 1 Sarah left me and our two kids to marry a woman. Shortly thereafter she left that woman (at the altar! Ha Ha!) and got into some pretty kinky BDSM stuff. Eventually she came back to me (sort of). I think she's never going to figure out what makes her happy. But Len just tries and tries to please her. Anyway, I'm getting a lot of text messages and emails about this new season of ""Transparent,"" mostly emotional reviews from my circle of friends. But a lot of people are texting me very personal questions about this ""throuple"" situation in which my character finds himself entangled. You see, my ex-wife has brought a third person into our bed, Lila (the incredible Alia Shawkat). I'm not sure why my friends and family are so curious about having sex with two people at the same time, but here are some frequently asked questions I'm fielding: ""Don't you think you're way too old to be sleeping with Maeby Fünke from 'Arrested Development'?"" (Steve, a friend from college) Me: Hi Steve, didn't know you still had my number. Look, I don't write the show. I'm 48, I guess Amy is in her 40s, and poor Alia is 28. So yes, on the surface it seems there is a huge age difference. What's your point? ""Were you nervous to film these sex scenes because your body is so gross? Did you not realize you were going to be mostly nude on TV?"" (Scott, my brother) Me: I meant to get in shape, I really did. As you know, we had a baby this year (your niece), so it's been hard to exercise much. Sorry if this was distracting to you. ""What is your wife going to say when she sees this?"" (my mom) Me: Hi mom. We watched it together. We always binge the whole season when it comes out. It was pretty uncomfortable, as you can imagine. I think I forgot to mention that I was shooting those scenes while she was home with the baby. How is dad? ""Were you actually nude? How does that whole thing work?"" (Jason, a guy I used to work with) Me: Really, man? We are nude-ish. Everybody wears flesh-colored bottoms. Mine were like those jobs that ballet dancers wear. The goal is to make everyone as comfortable as possible in a very uncomfortable situation. They even ask people that aren't needed to leave the set. So it ends up being the three almost-naked people, rolling around in bed with a sweaty camera guy and a grinning sound girl standing over us. ""They pay you to film this smut?"" (my dad) Me: Yes, Dad. How's Mom? In all seriousness, I get why people are curious. Most of us will probably never get the opportunity to experience a sexual situation like this. It looks great on paper. But in the real world, to me, it would feel like a lot of work. It's hard enough to please one person in bed. Another person would just... Zzzzzzzzz. Sorry, I got tired just thinking about it. So many areas to get around to! So many feelings to consider! And I know I'd get jealous and wonder if those other two are having fun without me when I'm not looking. Not to judge. If this is your life and it's working, more power to you. This is what I love about ""Transparent"" and the mind of Jill Soloway, the creator. She's built a world where characters are free to explore every aspect of themselves. Wherever that takes them. No matter the consequences. Another spoiler: In the end, Sarah and Len decide the throuple is not for them. They commit again to keep things just between them. To work hard to keep things fresh, hot, interesting, satisfying, weird. It's pretty beautiful. But then there's this huge cliffhanger! You have to watch it. Then text me and tell me what you think. Oh God, I hope she doesn't dump me again."
0,2017-10-12," LAST March, Amazon quietly changed the way it sells books. An obscure and seemingly harmless modification to its website has opened the door for some third-party sellers to deceive Amazon's customers by selling books as ""new"" that may not come straight from a publisher or its wholesaler, thus depriving authors of royalties they should have earned from the sale of a new book. Amazon decided to allow third-party sellers to be featured atop the primary purchase button for new books, a spot previously reserved for Amazon's own inventory, which comes directly from the publishers. Approved third-party sellers ""win"" this placement through a secret algorithm that considers, among other things, price, availability, seller's rating and shipping time. In doing so, Amazon abdicates its role as the prime retailer on its own website. The main requirement is that the books offered by the third-party seller must be ""new."" So when you, the customer, hit that main buy button, you should always expect to get a brand-new book, right? Not necessarily. To explain why, we have to take a journey into the underbelly of the book market. Have you ever asked yourself, when shopping for books on Amazon, how third-party sellers can be offering dozens of ""new"" books at prices way below even the discounted Amazon price? The reason is that such books could have been bought in bulk by a handful of giant online third-party sellers to be re-sold through Amazon as ""new"" books, when some are not. Where do these gray market books originate? There are several possible sources. Bookstores can return unsold books for credit. The publisher or distributor will sometimes sell these returns at a discount in bulk as overstocks, or sell excess inventory as remainders. Huge online bookstores buy these books (perfectly legal). Often, these books are marked with a line indicating they are remainders. But sometimes, they are not. In such cases, the online bookstore might resell them as ""new"" on Amazon. Blemished books also seem to feed the gray market for ""new"" books. Bookstores will return shopworn books or those damaged in shipping under the category of ""hurt books."" The publisher sells these books as used books. Online bookstores may buy them in bulk, sort through them, and resell as ""new"" the least damaged through Amazon. Publishers sell books to international wholesalers at large discounts on a non-returnable basis. By contract these books must be sold abroad, but wholesalers could quietly dump these books in the American market through a third-party seller on Amazon, cheating the publisher. Print-on-demand has created a new unscrupulous enterprise, that of counterfeiting books. These books look perfect; there is no way for the customer to tell they are illegal. And finally, a number of review copies are sent out free to media outlets. They are not supposed to be sold. Some book sellers apparently have standing arrangements with magazine conglomerates and television networks to bulk purchase all the review copies they receive, which they could presumably then sell on Amazon. While this isn't strictly illegal, it is unethical — and terribly unfair to authors and publishers. These third-party sellers may not always be selling ""new"" books, according to Amazon's own published definitions on its website, which, in part, read: ""New: A brand-new, unused, unread copy in perfect condition. The dust cover and original protective wrapping, if any, is intact."" ""Used — Like New: Dust cover is intact, with no nicks or tears. Spine has no signs of creasing. Pages are clean and not marred by notes or folds of any kind."" In many of these sales, the author gets zilch, or close to zilch. And, according to the Independent Book Publishers Association, which has been conducting its own research into the issue by purchasing books on Amazon, the customer is sometimes sold a used book under false pretenses. Publishers and authors, deprived of income and royalties, have long worried about this gray market. Amazon, to its credit, quickly tightened up its definition of a ""new"" book, to the one cited above. These definitions make clear that remainders are not regarded as ""new"" books, and the company insists that it follows a strict policy as to what qualifies. ""Only new books are eligible to be featured in the U.S. Books New Buy Box and be the 'primary offer' on a book's detail page, whether offered from third party sellers or Amazon,"" a company spokersperson said. ""We move quickly to address any violations. These recent changes mean that our U.S. online bookstore now works like the rest of Amazon.com, where third party sellers compete with Amazon for the sale of new items."" The Authors Guild has urged publishers to keep better track of remainders, overstocks and excess-discount sales, and some publishers have responded. But the cost of policing the market, marking and tracking books, and suing malefactors has proved daunting. Remainder overstock sales bring some revenue for publishers, but the authors receive little to no royalties. Amazon, in its drive to take over the book market, has made a change that, at least inadvertently, can mislead its own customers and be hurtful to authors. The Amazon action comes at a time when authors are struggling more than ever to make a living in the harsh economics of the digital marketplace. Amazon's policy will help undermine authors' incomes even further if it directs customers to ""new"" books for which the author receives no royalty. Comments posted online by buyers of everything from camera equipment to fountain pens suggest that Amazon's third-party sellers sometimes operate in a broadly gray area, failing to disclose provenance before a sale. Only after buyers try to repair broken items do they learn warranties aren't honored because the goods are gray. Amazon does what it can to rein in bad actors but it is at the top of a slippery slope in turning over its main buy button for new books to third-party sellers. This policy is bad for books, bad for authors and bad for Amazon's customers."
0,2017-10-15," WASHINGTON — On a sunny day in July, commuters arriving at Union Station, in the shadow of Capitol Hill, were greeted with free bananas passed out by Amazon employees. In a Senate building, lawmakers and their aides attended policy panels on how Amazon manages privacy on its Echo devices and how sales for small businesses are booming on its online store. The day was capped off with a cocktail reception hosted by Amazon's chief spokesman, Jay Carney — the former press secretary to President Obama. The public relations and lobbying push represents a new face for Amazon in Washington. Facing greater skepticism about its growing power over retail, including from President Trump, Amazon is following the well-worn path of oil, pharmaceutical and even other large tech companies, which try to bend policy in their favor by enhancing connections with federal officials. Amazon is sweeping the nation's capitol with a branding campaign of jobs creation and support for small businesses, promoting the upsides of its major expansion in media, groceries and transportation. This year, Amazon has increased its lobbying staff to 83 members from 60, making it one of the biggest corporate lobbying shops in town. The company is also on its way to surpassing its previous high for lobbying spending: $11.3 million last year. The $6.2 million Amazon spent in the first two quarters of this year was the 11th most among companies, above Exxon and far above Walmart, which spent $3.6 million in the same period. The company's more aggressive approach, focused on building relationships with leading politicians and improving the company's overall reputation, is a break from its past. Before last year, the company relied on a no-frills operation for more than a decade, prodding officials in Washington on narrow laws and regulations and arguing about the nuances of issues like sales taxes and copyright. The efforts may not directly apply to an imminent bill or regulation, but they allow the company to steer policy conversations that may be important to Amazon in the future. Amazon is hosting events for lawmakers, like the day of events in July, and holding discussions on transportation and labor policies for congressional staff and policy makers at its sleek offices near Capitol Hill. Speaker Paul D. Ryan and other political leaders have visited Amazon's fulfillment centers in their home districts, where Amazon talks up the thousands of jobs those warehouses support. Amazon's strategic shift has happened as politicians are getting bolder in their criticism about the size and influence of big tech companies. Republicans and Democrats alike have focused on issues including antitrust, privacy and public disclosure. Many of the harshest attacks have been directed at Facebook and Google, which also have robust lobbying arms in Washington. But Amazon has attracted its own set of vocal critics, who say the company's push into groceries, fashion, transportation and other industries threatens competition. President Trump has lashed out at the company and Jeff Bezos, the company's chief executive, multiple times, accusing the company of avoiding taxes among other things. The company has said it follows all tax laws and has supported a bill that would force online commerce sites to collect sales taxes. ""The concentration of power in the hands of a few companies has the potential to hurt the economy and consumers in the long run,"" said Representative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat who is the ranking member of the subcommittee that oversees antitrust matters. He raised concerns over Amazon's $13.4 billion purchase of Whole Foods over the summer, noting that antitrust laws may need an update to account for the power internet companies have over the economy. Amazon, which declined to comment for this article, has said that its online retail business makes up a minority of all commerce and that it is producing tens of thousands of jobs in regions that have long been in decline. The company had 180,000 full-time employees in the United States at the end of 2016, nearly double its head count five years earlier. The company has said those gains help make up for the job losses from struggling brick-and-mortar retailers. In the span of a few weeks this summer, Linda McMahon, head of the Small Business Administration, visited Amazon's headquarters in Seattle, where the company had small retailers on hand to talk about how Amazon had helped their businesses. Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, attended the opening of a new fulfillment center in Edwardsville, Ill. And Senator Rob Portman, a Republican, visited a new fulfillment center in his home state of Ohio. ""Got to meet some of the 3,000+ Ohioans employed at this plant. #Jobs,"" Mr. Portman wrote on Twitter at the time. ""They are doing all this reputation stuff around how it is creating jobs and that's helped it generate a lot of media attention,"" said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of Institute for Local Self Reliance, a nonprofit group that promotes community economic development. Last year, her organization published a paper that argued the company was making it harder for smaller retailers to make money from selling on Amazon. Amazon has also decided in recent years to spend more money in the broader influence ecosystem of Washington. In 2016, Amazon gave more than $10,000 each to 66 think tanks, lobbying groups and political organizations. More than a dozen organizations were new to its sponsorship roster, like the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Foundation and the conservative Law & Economic Center at George Mason University. Financing Washington's ecosystem of research and lobbying groups is a common practice for tech companies such as Google and Microsoft, but Amazon had not been as active until recent years. Last month, it donated $50 million to a White House plan to promote computer science in classrooms. Amazon is racing to catch up. Yet even with similar lobbying armies, Google and Facebook have not escaped criticism — in their cases over their platforms' potential to shape public opinion. ""With Amazon, we need more transparency and need to look at longer term factors when it comes to competition,"" Amy Klobuchar, a Democratic Senator from Minnesota said in a recent interview. ""The people at the Justice Department in antitrust need to look at deals in other ways."""
0,2017-10-16," The city sits astride an extensive transportation network of trains, planes and automobiles. It has six colleges and universities with a total of 60,000 students. There is prime office space available, and new apartments downtown are far less expensive than housing in New York City or even Jersey City. According to city officials and developers, it has much of what Amazon, the retail giant, has said it wants as it searches for a place to build its second headquarters, in a national competition that has become known as HQ2. The city is Newark. ""We have exactly what Amazon is looking for, in terms of expanding their company in a city that will help them grow and where it would have real social impact,"" said Mayor Ras J. Baraka in an interview. ""Newark is an opportunity to make a real statement, about what they're trying to accomplish in the United States in the age of Trump."" On Monday afternoon, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Senator Cory A. Booker, the former Newark mayor, joined Mr. Baraka at Rutgers Business School, which shares its building in the city with Audible Inc., whose 1,000 employees produce and sell audio entertainment and which is owned by Amazon, to announce that Newark is the state's official bid in the headquarters race. The competition to secure the second headquarters, which Amazon has said will mean a $5 billion investment and 50,000 new jobs, has been fierce, with more than four dozen cities expected to submit bids by Thursday, the deadline set by the company. Governments have fallen over themselves offering Amazon billions of dollars in tax breaks and other subsidies and, in some cases, free land, prompting criticism from some economists and good government groups. In New Jersey, Mr. Christie and legislative leaders are offering up to $7 billion in state tax breaks for Amazon. The company already has a substantial footprint in the state, where it has several distribution centers that employ 5,500 workers, at substantially lower wages than are being promised for HQ2. Last year, Amazon announced it would open two more centers, adding another 2,000 full-time jobs. ""They're talking about doubling already generous corporate tax breaks,"" said Jon Whiten, vice president of New Jersey Policy Perspective. ""They're not saying, we'll invest billions in New Jersey Transit so workers can get to work on time, or in affordable housing so workers can have a decent place to live."" Handicappers have put New York in the top 10 among the competitors for an HQ2 based on Amazon's own criteria, which include good public transportation, a skilled work force, the cost of doing business and a location within a metro area of more than one million residents. Moody's Analytics ranked New York sixth, behind Austin, Tex.; Atlanta; Philadelphia; Rochester; and Pittsburgh. But the Anderson Economic Group, a consulting firm that represents companies seeking locations and cities trying to attract them, ranked the New York metropolitan area No. 1, ahead of Chicago, Los Angeles and Boston, out of 35 candidates. ""It's at the absolute top in the sheer number of educated people and it's at the top with mass transit,"" said Patrick L. Anderson, the firm's founder. ""But it's at the bottom in the cost of doing business."" ""New York can win,"" he said, ""but it can't be in Manhattan, and I doubt it'll work in Brooklyn."" That could be the silver lining for Newark, where commercial rents are a third to half of those in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Newark may not have the glamour of New York City, but it's only an 18-minute train ride away. And market-rate apartment rents — which run about $30 a square foot — are the equivalent of subsidized housing in New York City. Newark also sits directly above the fiber optic cable spine running along the Eastern Seaboard, allowing companies to tap into some of the fastest internet services in the country and among the least expensive ultra-broadband network. And downtown, there is a Whole Foods — the upscale supermarket chain Amazon acquired earlier this year — as well as the fast-growing headquarters of Audible. The city, with its battle-scarred reputation, may seem like a long shot, but Mr. Baraka has pulled together a coalition convinced that Amazon would accelerate the city's comeback. There is a total of $2.6 billion worth of projects in the pipeline, according to acting Deputy Mayor Carmelo Garcia. ""I think the prospects are great,"" said Ben Feigenbaum, chief operating office of Edison Properties, a major landowner in Newark. ""All the developers and political leaders know that Amazon would be good for everyone."" His company is in the midst of converting a 110-year-old warehouse at Edison Place and McCarter Highway into an office building, alongside a new park, Mulberry Commons, which the city is building after a decade of delays. Broadridge Financial Solutions, which provides technical services to financial institutions, recently announced it would move its headquarters and ultimately 1,000 employees to Newark from Jersey City. Several years ago, Panasonic moved its North American headquarters to a new glass tower downtown. There are also 7,000 apartments being developed downtown, once a mix of institutions, office buildings, courthouses and government offices. Many developers were wary when Mr. Baraka, son of the firebrand poet and activist Amiri Baraka, won the mayor's race in 2014. But he seems to have won their confidence with his focus on making the city better, not on higher office. And with a quarter of Newark's population living below the poverty line, he has pushed to extend the downtown development boom to the city's more impoverished areas in the south and west. As of this month, developers are required to set aside 20 percent of newly built or renovated apartments for low- and moderate-income tenants. In addition, the mayor has pushed developers to ensure that half the construction crews and half the permanent jobs for those projects are for Newark residents. ""This administration has been an advocate for the progress we've made,"" said Jonathan Cortell, vice president of L+M Development Partners, ""and very much intent on adding their own imprimatur on what we're doing next."" Mr. Cortell's company is best known for converting the long-closed Hahne's department store on Broad Street into apartments, with a street-level atrium that now includes Whole Foods. The project, which obtained tax credits and tax-exempt financing, includes 64 apartments for moderate-income households, such as a family of three making no more than $50,100. Audible subsidized the rents of 20 employees who moved into Hahne's as part of its Live Local program and helped create a pedestrian corridor between Audible's building and the rest of downtown. Two years ago, Audible established a technology venture fund in its building that has so far invested in 37 start-ups, with the hope that they will grow and rent space in Newark. For the first phase of Amazon's HQ2 project, Newark is offering space in existing office buildings downtown, including 33 Washington Street and the Gateway Center complex near Newark Penn Station. The second and third phases, which could ultimately include 7.5 million square feet of space, could be built on vacant land or go in at three planned projects: Mulberry Commons, South of Market or Lotus Riverfront. For the last project, across the street from Audible, Ben Korman, a developer and the founder of Lotus Equity Group, is planning to demolish Riverside Stadium, a minor-league baseball park that was part of an earlier, ill-advised attempt to accelerate Newark's comeback. The city and the county invested as much as $34 million, but it never drew the hoped-for crowds. Even before the Amazon sweepstakes started, Mr. Korman's company planned to demolish the brick stadium to make way for a 2.3 million-square-foot mix of residential and commercial buildings, retail and green space. Amazon could speed up the construction schedule. ""It'll be amazing if Amazon settles here,"" he said during a walk through Newark's downtown. ""It'll be even more amazing if more tech companies settle here."""
0,2017-10-17," Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here's the sign-up.) Thomas Fuller, the San Francisco bureau chief for The New York Times, describes his experience covering the fires in Northern California. I keep a satellite phone in the trunk of my car, the same one I used to cover disasters and insurgencies in places like Myanmar and Nepal. But I never thought I would need it in Napa Valley, not for a wildfire anyway. During a week spent covering the fires in Northern California, I fell back on my training as a foreign correspondent: finding the satellite on the smoky horizon, locking in the phone's antenna and dictating paragraphs to patient editors. But this was not a foreign land. It was my own country, and the conveniences that we take for granted had collapsed. Traffic lights went black and commerce shut down. Streets that were normally filled with tourists in the charming towns of wine country were deserted except for crews of exhausted firefighters, sheriff's deputies and a few reporters. In the evacuation zones, rows of destroyed houses made it feel like a country at war, emptied of its civilian population. Small fires seemed to pop up everywhere. As I raced down narrow country roads to meet deadlines, I caught glimpses of smoldering embers on tree stumps a few feet away. I felt vulnerable while driving through tunnels of vegetation — it would be easy to be surrounded by fire and trapped. Everything smelled of smoke: my clothes, my car, my bag, my fingers. I feel enormously grateful to the dozens of people who took the time to articulate their grieving, some while standing in the rubble of their homes. The fires stripped away their privacy. Their kitchens, their exercise equipment, their hobbies — their lives — were in cinders at our feet. I think back to meeting Lisa Layman, her azure eyes staring at the ashes of her home at Coffey Park in Santa Rosa. She was recovering from cancer and recently had a kidney removed. The night before, she had escaped with her Bible and a scrapbook of her son's early years. That is all she had. It is a reporter's job to bring empathy to disasters like this. But I wondered how I could ever comprehend the magnitude of her loss. • Although the direct danger from wildfires may be waning, there is an unseen hazard from household chemicals and pesticides in hollowed-out homes.

The key ingredient in retardant is ammonium phosphate, which produces nonflammable carbon — think of a diamond or pencil lead — when it chemically reacts with plant cellulose, Mr. Matousek said. Fire retardant is essentially high-quality fertilizer and is not considered dangerous for people or plants. But it can be toxic to fish, Mr. Matousek said, by causing underwater plant life to grow and choke the oxygen from the water. The United States Forest Service bans its use within 300 feet of a waterway unless human life or property is threatened. ""When you dump that type of nutrient load on a landscape, it's going to change a lot of dynamics,"" said Richard Halsey, director of the California Chaparral Institute, which seeks to preserve native shrubland habitats. ""It does cause significant harm to aquatic organisms."" Where fire retardant lands is also important for its efficacy. Because it needs to be applied in a continuous line, it is typically dyed red or pink. California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays. Tell us what you want to see: CAtoday@nytimes.com.

1,2017-10-17," The head of Amazon Studios, Roy Price, resigned on Tuesday, just days after a producer publicly accused him of sexual harassment, a spokesman for the company said. Mr. Price, who was in charge of Amazon's efforts to create original movies and television shows, had been suspended last week. Last week, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Isa Dick Hackett, an executive producer of the popular Amazon show ""The Man in the High Castle,"" said Mr. Price had lewdly and repeatedly propositioned her in 2015. Just hours after the article was published, Amazon announced that Mr. Price had been suspended. Representatives for Amazon did not immediately answer inquiries on whether or not a broader investigation of Mr. Price has been conducted in the days since. The author of The Hollywood Reporter article, Kim Masters, previously reported for the publication The Information that an investigation had been conducted a few weeks after the alleged incident two years ago. Mr. Price, who could not be reached for comment, made no secret of his departure from Amazon. Shortly before 5 p.m. Eastern time on Tuesday, he updated his Facebook page to say he had left his job. The move followed the firing and Hollywood-wide denunciation of the mogul Harvey Weinstein, which resulted from the many accusations of sexual harassment and assault against him. (Mr. Weinstein, through his spokeswoman, has denied engaging in nonconsensual sex.) Mr. Price became a bit player in the Weinstein story when Rose McGowan, an actress who had reached a settlement with Mr. Weinstein in 1997 after an episode at a film festival, posted a series of tweets directed at Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon. In them, Ms. McGowan said she had told the head of Amazon Studios that Mr. Weinstein had raped her. (Ms. McGowan did not mention Mr. Price by name and did not respond to a message on Twitter asking for clarification.) Before that series of tweets, Ms. McGowan had directed a Twitter message at Mr. Price concerning Mr. Weinstein, asking, ""Remember when I told you not to do a deal with him and why?"" Mr. Price, a Harvard alumnus who once worked at the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, had been an executive at Amazon for the last 13 years. He oversaw several TV shows, including ""Transparent"" and ""The Man in the High Castle."" Amazon's original programming has not gotten the same buzz as Netflix shows like ""Stranger Things"" or Hulu's ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" which won an Emmy last month in the best drama category. Amazon was already in the process of trying out a new game plan for its original programming by time Mr. Price was suspended. On his watch, Amazon distributed the Oscar-winning film ""Manchester by the Sea,"" and made itself into a force on the film festival circuit. The recent New York Film Festival opened with an Amazon-financed film, Richard Linklater's ""Last Flag Flying""; featured an Amazon coproduction, Todd Haynes's ""Wonderstruck,"" as its ""centerpiece"" attraction; and closed with the Amazon-distributed ""Wonder Wheel,"" the latest from Woody Allen. The red-carpet portion of the ""Wonder Wheel"" premiere was canceled on Saturday, two days after Amazon announced Mr. Price's suspension. Albert Cheng, the chief operations officer for Amazon Studios and the former head of digital operations at ABC, was assigned to be Mr. Price's interim replacement."

1,2017-10-19," Hours after New York City released its bid for Amazon's second headquarters, Mayor Bill de Blasio conveyed an entirely different message to a Brooklyn audience on Wednesday night: The behemoth online retailer is bad for small businesses. Shop local, like he does. At roughly the same time in the Bronx, the New York Yankees moved one win away from the World Series. But if they make it, they will do so without the usual mayoral boosterism; Mr. de Blasio, an avid Red Sox fan, said he could not bring himself to go to Yankee Stadium. Mayors in New York and elsewhere have long accepted that a fundamental part of their job is to be a champion for their cities, even if it means putting aside personal preferences in the interest of being a civic ambassador. Mr. de Blasio is not that mayor. With re-election appearing to be all but assured next month, the mayor has taken pains to cement the notion that he is very much the same liberal Democrat from Brooklyn who was elected in a landslide four years ago. He has shown no interest in establishing close relationships with the city's business leaders. Until this summer, he avoided visiting the High Line — an architectural and tourist attraction that many other cities have sought to emulate. He has rarely attended marquee events or indulged in the night life or restaurants favored by the city's expense-account set, preferring a near-daily routine in his old Brooklyn neighborhood of pastries and a Y.M.C.A. workout. On Wednesday, Mr. de Blasio dug in even further; the mayor, who said recently that he had never shopped on Amazon, urged the audience to follow his example — casually throwing Starbucks under the bus for good measure. ""If, like me, you love your local neighborhood stores, your bakeries, your cafes, your clothing stores, all these things, then you need to spend your money there and not at Starbucks and not at other alternative places,"" he said, to applause from the audience in northwest Brooklyn. ""A lot of this is economic and consumer-choice-based,"" Mr. de Blasio said, shortly after his administration released a raft of documents, including a letter from the mayor, outlining why Amazon should base its operations in the five boroughs. ""So a lot of people are turning to Amazon and other online options, that's one of the underlying factors."" Kathryn Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City, an influential business group that supported the city's Amazon bid, said the mayor's comments looked to be at odds with the city's public courting of the retailer. ""When the mayor sends this kind of mixed message, it appears that he does not think his words matter,"" she said. A spokesman for Starbucks pointed to the roughly 8,000 people employed by the company in New York City and the benefits they receive, including health coverage, and to efforts like a voting drive in Jamaica, Queens, and hosting meetings between police officers and New Yorkers in its coffee shops. ""We welcome the mayor to join us for any of these happening regularly in his hometown,"" the spokesman, Reggie Borges, said in an email. The mayor, his aides and supporters have defended Mr. de Blasio's stances as a reflection of his true self and say that anything else would be pandering or false. Some find his honesty — especially when it comes to the Yankees, who can cause headaches for many New Yorkers — to be refreshing in a politician. ""I'm not going to fake anything,"" Mr. de Blasio said on Thursday at an unrelated news conference. ""I'm going to be myself. They'll have their games and if they win in the end, we will honor them."" When the mayor adamantly told reporters at the outdoor event that he would not attend a game if the Yankees made it to the World Series, a fan standing nearby shouted: ""The city takes precedence!"" After the news conference, the fan, Jerry Urcivoli, 45, said he was aghast that the mayor would put his loyalty to the Red Sox ahead of his role as mayor. ""You don't put that aside and say, 'That's my personal belief and I should go as a representative of Manhattan and New York City'?"" Mr. Urcivoli said. ""It's disgraceful the mayor's not going."" It did seem only recently that Mr. de Blasio was open to finally checking off a few boxes on his personal mayoral to-do list. Last month, the mayor attended the opening night gala at the Metropolitan Opera, where ""Norma"" was performed. It was his first visit to that event. The next day, he visited the High Line for the first time. But with polls showing him with a 44 percentage point lead over his closest challenger, Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican assemblywoman, Mr. de Blasio seems to be digging in again. ""I am a crazed, rabid baseball fan and Red Sox fan,"" Mr. de Blasio told The Daily News editorial board on Tuesday. ""It is constitutionally impossible to quote unquote root for the New York Yankees."" It may also speak to both the nature of fandom and to the particularities of his deep devotion to the home team of Boston, where Mr. de Blasio grew up. ""Expectations would be that even when people move to new environments they tend to pick up the allegiance of the team,"" said Edward R. Hirt, a professor of psychology at Indiana University in Bloomington, who studies sports fandom and social identity. ""If you were the mayor of that community and wanting to build community spirit you'd want to be seen as identifying with that."" ""It is seemingly a head-scratcher,"" he added. Mr. de Blasio's challengers in the mayoral race were less confused. ""Unconscionable,"" Ms. Malliotakis told reporters Thursday. ""If you don't like the Yankees, you don't like being in New York,"" said Bo Dietl, an independent candidate for mayor who attended Wednesday night's game, seated behind home plate. ""He should not be the mayor of this great city. It just shows his narcissism."" As for Amazon, Mr. Dietl said he did not use the site, a rare point of harmony with Mr. de Blasio. ""I like touchy-feely. I like to go to a store and look at what I'm going to buy,"" he said. Jerry Skurnik, a political consultant and Mets fan, said that past mayors had been rabid in their New York fandom — as Rudolph W. Giuliani was for the Yankees — or uninterested in sports and supportive of the local team, as was the case with Ed Koch and with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a Boston native who grew up a Red Sox fan but rooted for the Yankees against his childhood team as mayor. ""As a baseball fan who also doesn't like the Yankees, I'm following it with interest,"" Mr. Skurnik said. But he added, ""I don't think any significant number of voters use this as a guide to who they're going to vote for."""

4,2017-10-19," MELBOURNE, Australia — When Borders opened in 2002 across the street from Readings, Melbourne's best-known independent bookseller, retail experts predicted catastrophe for the musty old shop competing with the shiny new chain store. Instead, Australians rejected Borders right into bankruptcy. Starbucks has also failed miserably here in a country where cafe loyalty is king. And when it comes to Amazon, which has announced it will open its warehouse-based online sales juggernaut soon in Australia, many book-loving Australians are not shy about hoping for another epitaph. ""I want to beat them,"" said Mark Rubbo, Readings' co-owner, discussing Amazon as he stared across Lygon Street to where Borders used to be. ""I don't like the idea of this monolith devouring everything."" How much of the world's shopping habits Amazon will control worldwide is a question confronting retailers of all kinds. The ""everything store,"" as the site is known, now stocks roughly 400 million products, from toothpaste and televisions to sex toys, and several Australian retail chains have already seen their stock prices decline since Amazon announced its plans in April. But changing Australians' reading habits may be more of a challenge. Books are bellwethers of great symbolic weight, not just because they were Amazon's first product and because the company often uses them to wedge itself into new markets, but also because books and bookstores are tightly linked to Australia's sense of itself, and to the country's beloved ecosystem of local commerce. You know all those bespoke experiences that American urbanites have been reviving: the artisanal butcher and barber shops, the gourmet grocer and the community bookstore? In Australia, though weakened by shopping centers, they never really died. This is still a place where many Australians can buy a novel, sausages and shampoo in three different shops, each owned by a neighbor with children at the local school. Big box stores are rare and independent bookstores are strong: Their sales accounted for around 26 percent of Australia's book business in 2015, according to Nielsen, up from 20 percent in the late 2000s, more than double the share for independents in the United States. Romantics (and some booksellers) argue that Australians simply favor local offerings. Cynics (and some economists) argue that many Australians are just wealthy and complacent, unfamiliar with more convenient alternatives that they'll eventually embrace and come to love. Regardless, this much is clear: Amazon's arrival is a stress test not just for individual retail categories but also for Australia's own writing, and way of life. ""Our culture is, and all cultures are, being swamped by outside influences,"" Mr. Rubbo said. ""We're fighting to defend our voice."" Amazon's first ""fulfillment center"" in Australia sits at the intersection of several highways about an hour south of central Melbourne. There are food companies and warehouses for Penguin Random House nearby, and inside, room for millions of products. Union organizers say they are watching the location closely to ensure that new hires receive Australia's minimum wage of roughly 18 Australian dollars, around $14.50. But on a recent visit, the warehouse was empty except for a few gray shelves in the middle of a gray floor. The only employees were construction workers clad in neon-green and finishing a bathroom. What comes next is anyone's guess. Amazon turned down requests for an interview, and did not respond to emails with specific questions. The company is known for this sort of thing, preferring buzz to transparency, and here in Australia, that's led to excitement for many who are hoping for an easier, much broader online shopping experience — along with real estate speculation in the warehouse market, the rollout of a new free delivery service by Australia's postal service, and what the chief executive at one large retailing conglomerate described as ""a healthy sense of paranoia."" Booksellers know the feeling. Amazon hasn't explained why it's taken so long to bring its full retail operation to Australia but Australians have been able to order from Amazon's American site for years and even with shipping costs, book prices are often equal to or cheaper than what can be found in Sydney or Melbourne. There are other digital booksellers already in Australia too, including Book Depository, an Amazon subsidiary from Britain, and Booktopia, a start-up that nearly went public last year. Tony Nash, the chief executive of Booktopia, which according to the company, controls about 4 percent of Australia's book market, said that Amazon has already made everyone more competitive. Booktopia, for example, now uses conveyors, automatic packing machines and a staff of 150 people to get books into customers' hands, in some cases on the same day they're ordered. ""It's not about price,"" Mr. Nash said. Especially in countries with small widely dispersed populations like Canada and Australia, where 24 million people are spread across a continent the size of the United States, ""it's about the logistics."" But isolation, as Australians know better than most, can help and hurt. Sean Guy, a manager at The Bookshop in Darwin, Australia's northernmost major city, said if he lived in a more isolated community like Alice Springs, in the nation's interior desert region, ""I'd probably find it a lot easier to go online for five minutes than call the local bookshop."" For most everyone else, he added, bricks-and-books still work. ""You'll never be able to beat the prices of Amazon, but you can save on time by going into a store,"" he said. ""And people like supporting local businesses."" Australians already buy more books per capita than Americans (based on Nielsen sales figures) and spend more hours reading. Michael Heyward, the publisher at Text, an independent publisher with a mix of new and established Australian writers, including Helen Garner, said that maybe Australia's built up enough independence to live with Amazon in peace. ""I would like to believe we can have our cake and eat it,"" he said in an interview at his office in Melbourne. But just below his own bookish calm — and the not-so-secret hope that Amazon will help sell more books — there are wider concerns. ""Let's not outsource our minds to the narcissism of the global algorithm,"" warned Anna Funder, the author of ""Stasiland"" and ""All That I Am,"" at a booksellers conference last year. And she's not alone. ""People who work in the book industry are agents of culture rather than just instruments of commerce,"" said Tim Winton, the author of Australian classics like ""Cloudstreet,"" and one of Australia's best-known writers. ""When you take away their role as agents of culture and reduce them to instruments of capitalism, it changes the dynamic."" In interviews with more than a dozen booksellers, authors, independent publishers and lawyers specializing in copyright, two worst-case scenarios emerged. One, widely considered the more likely, involves Amazon convincing Australia's big publishers to provide steep discounts and promises of faster delivery, driving down prices and author royalties for all books, and possibly putting independent booksellers' orders at the end of the line. ""Amazon controls the negotiating process,"" said David Gaunt, the co-owner of Gleebooks in Sydney. ""If they choose to sell the new Richard Flanagan book at $9.99,"" he added, referring to Australia's last winner of the Man Booker Prize, who has a new novel out, ""we'll sell none."" The second nightmare scenario, according to booksellers and authors, is that Amazon will find a way to tilt Australia's labor, tax and import laws in its favor. Stock grants for employees could be used to decrease tax liability, as Amazon has done in Europe. What else Amazon might do is a question lawyers and consultants are already gaming out, while lobbying the Australian government, which at this point seems determined to protect its own. Starting in July, a new digital services tax will be levied on all online purchases of 1,000 Australian dollars, or roughly $780, or less. Netflix, eBay and Amazon will all be affected. Australian lawmakers have also resisted calls from economists on the government's own Productivity Commission to eliminate the country's parallel import restrictions. The rules essentially give Australian publishers a national monopoly over any book they publish. Booksellers are not allowed to import books from another country if the book has been published by an Australian copyright holder within 30 days of overseas release and if the Australian publisher can supply the book within 90 days. Critics say the rules are protectionist, and a cause of overpriced books. But these restrictions, copyright lawyers say, should keep Amazon from stocking its warehouses with cheaper books shipped in from abroad. And they are widely seen by authors as the foundation of Australia's literary culture. The copyright law that went into effect in May 1969 essentially created a protected market in a country that, until then, had relied almost entirely on Britain for its books. Now, many authors say, any effort to soften the rules or let Amazon skirt them would weaken local publishers, reduce royalty rates and return Australia to a reliance on outsiders who may not care to publish the array of Australian authors now in circulation. ""What makes me anxious is this sort of return to a centralizing of cultural power,"" said Mr. Winton, who has published more than two dozen books for adults and children. For Australia, he said, Amazon may represent a step backward: ""It's a retrograde move."" Inside the Readings flagship store on Lygon Street, Australian authors get prominent displays on front tables and on the first shelves people see. At Riverbend Books in Brisbane, another independent bookseller well known to publishers and authors, roughly 60 percent of the books are written by Australians. Would Amazon give local authors the same level of promotion? Will it publish and print its own books in Australia or make sellers of used books more dominant? Will it undermine or compete with the community ethos that bookstores like Readings represent? ""We have a lot of questions,"" said Mr. Rubbo, 69, a quiet, casual man with intense blue eyes who has expanded Readings to seven locations in and around Melbourne over the past 41 years. He said that since the arrival of Borders in 2002, Readings and many other bookstores have strengthened their bonds with local authors and readers. Events are now the norm; Readings will do 260 this year alone. The strongest independent bookstores, while maintaining a 1990s feel at times, complete with racks of music CDs, are also linked up with universities and schools and Australia's well-known writers festivals in Sydney, Melbourne and elsewhere. Many customers, while open to buying some items from Amazon, seem pleased with the status quo for books. ""I like seeing the physical book itself, and the chance to find things you wouldn't find otherwise,"" said Sonya Theys, 24, who was browsing at Readings one recent evening. Authors are even more zealous. ""If literature is a religion, the bookstore is the church,"" said Alec Patric, an award-winning novelist who also happens to work at Readings. ""It's a delicate equilibrium."" Amazon's deals with publishers could upset all of that. Mr. Rubbo said he has pressed them to keep the playing field even, to not give Amazon any special treatment with delivery time or price. Suzy Wilson, the owner of Riverbend, has made the same case to major Australian publishers. She said she was told not to fret. ""They were giving me a bit of a pep talk really,"" she said. But as negotiations between Amazon and local publishers continue, the major players are staying silent. Penguin Random House and Hachette turned down requests for comment. Michael Gordon-Smith, the chief executive of the Australian Publishers Association, sent a statement by email: ""We welcome any new ways to get books to Australian readers and any new investment in the Australian industry that is consistent with good corporate citizenship and respect for creators' rights."" Ms. Wilson and Mr. Rubbo both said that Amazon's power could bend the will of even the well-intentioned. In their nightmares, they see declining revenues, shuttered stores and silent, dying neighborhoods. ""It's really crucial that these places survive and thrive,"" Ms. Wilson said. ""I wish I was more optimistic."""
0,2017-10-20," SEATTLE — I live in the city that hit the Amazon jackpot, now the biggest company town in America. Long before the mad dash to land the second headquarters for the world's largest online retailer, Amazon found us. Since then, we've been overwhelmed by a future we never had any say over. With the passing of Thursday's deadline for final bids, it's been strange to watch nearly every city in the United States pimp itself out for the right to become HQ2 — and us. Tax breaks. Free land. Champagne in the drinking fountains. Anything! In this pageant for prosperity, the desperation is understandable. Amazon's offer to create 50,000 high-paying jobs and invest $5 billion in your town is a once-in-a-century, destiny-shaping event. Amazon is not mining coal or cooking chemicals or offering minimum wage to hapless ""associates."" The new jobs will pay $100,000 or more in salary and benefits. In Seattle, Amazon employees are the kind of young, educated, mass-transit-taking, innovative types that municipal planners dream of. So, if you're lucky enough to land HQ2 — congrats! But be careful, all you urban suitors longing for a hip, creative class. You think you can shape Amazon? Not a chance. It will shape you. Well before Amazon disrupted books, music, television, furniture — everything — it disrupted Seattle. At first, it was quirky in the Seattle way: Jeff Bezos, an oversize mailbox and his little online start-up. His thing was books, remember? How quaint. How retro. Almost any book, delivered to your doorstep, cheap. But soon, publishers came to see Amazon as the evil empire, bringing chaos to an industry that hadn't changed much since Herman Melville's day. The prosperity bomb, as it's called around here, came when Amazon took over what had been a clutter of parking lots and car dealers near downtown, and decided to build a very urban campus. This neighborhood had been proposed as a grand central city park, our own Champs-Élysées, with land gifted by Paul Allen, a Microsoft co-founder. But voters rejected it. I still remember an architect friend telling me that cities should grow ""organically,"" not by design. Cities used to be tied to geography: a river, a port, the lee side of a mountain range. Boeing grew up here, in part, because of its proximity to spruce timber used to make early airplanes. And then, water turned the industrial engines that helped to win World War II. The new era dawned with Microsoft, after the local boy Bill Gates returned with a fledgling company. From then on, the mark of a successful city was one that could cluster well-educated people in a cool place. ""The Smartest Americans Are Heading West"" was the headline in the recent listing of the Bloomberg Brain Concentration Index. This pattern is likely to continue, as my colleagues at the Upshot calculated in picking Denver to win the Amazon sweepstakes. At the bottom of the brain index was Muskegon, Mich., a place I recently visited. I found the city lovely, with its lakeside setting, fine old houses and world-class museum. When I told a handful of Muskegonites about the problems in Seattle from the metastatic growth of Amazon, they were not sympathetic. What comes with the title of being the fastest growing big city in the country, with having the nation's hottest real estate market, is that the city no longer works for some people. For many others, the pace of change, not to mention the traffic, has been disorienting. The character of Seattle, a rain-loving communal shrug, has changed. Now we're a city on amphetamines. Amazon is secretive. And they haven't been the best civic neighbor, late to the charity table. Yes, the company has poured $38 billion into the city's economy. They have 40,000 employees here, who in turn attracted 50,000 other new jobs. They own or lease a fifth of all the class A office space. But median home prices have doubled in five years, to $700,000. This is not a good thing in a place where teachers and cops used to be able to afford a house with a water view. Our shiny new megalopolis has spawned the inevitable political backlash. If you think there's nothing more annoying than a Marxist with a bullhorn extolling a failed 19th-century economic theory, put that person on your City Council. So Seattle's council now includes a socialist, Kshama Sawant, who wants ""the public"" to take over Amazon ownership. Other council members have proposed a tax on jobs. Try that proposal in Detroit. As a Seattle native, I miss the old city, the lack of pretense, and dinner parties that didn't turn into discussions of real estate porn. But I'm happy that wages have risen faster here than anywhere else in the country. I like the fresh energy. To the next Amazon lottery winner I would say, enjoy the boom — but be careful what you wish for."
1,2017-10-20," SEATTLE — Amazon on Friday tried to quell concerns among employees about sexual harassment accusations against an executive, sending an email to its staff saying the company would review its policies to ensure that ""they are doing their job to provide a harassment-free workplace."" The email is the first broad internal communication by Amazon since Roy Price, who oversaw Amazon Studios, left the company this week after details of the accusations became public. A lawyer for the woman who has made the accusations said Amazon previously investigated and knew all the details about the episode, which happened in 2015. Amazon's handling of Mr. Price has set off confusion, debate and finger-pointing inside the company, according to two employees. The people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality policies, said numerous employees were heatedly discussing the timing of Mr. Price's departure. Some current and former employees are suggesting that the scarcity of women at the upper echelons of Amazon could have made the company more lenient toward Mr. Price until his actions became a public relations embarrassment. ""I think this is pretty straightforward,"" said Julia Cheiffetz, who worked in Amazon's publishing division for several years, leaving in 2014 to become an executive editor at HarperCollins. ""An organization's culture is shaped by its leadership. We can talk about how these stories are endemic to certain industries — Hollywood, Silicon Valley — but the larger issue is one of representation. Who is in charge? Who makes the rules? And who enforces them?"" Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment. The episode involving Mr. Price occurred in 2015 when he was in a car with Isa Dick Hackett, a Hollywood producer. She told investigators for Amazon shortly after the car ride that Mr. Price made unwanted sexual advances toward her. Mr. Price's career at Amazon continued until last week, when Ms. Hackett shared the details of the episode publicly for the first time, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. Amazon suspended him the day the article appeared, and he left the company on Tuesday. Amazon's recent actions took place in the middle of a firestorm over revelations in The New York Times and The New Yorker about another entertainment industry figure, Harvey Weinstein, who has been accused of decades of sexual harassment and abuse. Ms. Hackett, for one, has said she was emboldened to go public with her story by the willingness of Mr. Weinstein's accusers to speak up. But there is confusion among some Amazon employees about why Mr. Price did not lose his job in 2015 after the company learned of Ms. Hackett's accusations. One consequence Mr. Price faced after the episode was being told to be careful how much alcohol he drank at work functions, according to a third employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality policies. The employee was briefed on the decision. Some of the frustration inside the company has been directed at Jeff Blackburn, the Amazon senior vice president who directly managed Mr. Price. Mr. Blackburn sent the email to Amazon's film and television employees on Friday, and it was more broadly distributed by other executives to their groups. In his email, Mr. Blackburn said Amazon was ""taking this situation, and the general issue of sexual harassment, very seriously."" He said it was not appropriate to share personnel details publicly, but said that Mr. Price's departure ""followed new information that surfaced last week, as well as other factors."" His email did not describe the new information. On the same day Mr. Price was suspended, an actress, Rose McGowan, posted a series of messages on Twitter saying she had previously told the head of Amazon Studios, the company's movie and television group, that Mr. Weinstein had raped her. Mr. Weinstein's spokeswoman has said he denies all allegations of nonconsensual sex. Charles Harder, a lawyer for Mr. Price, did not respond to messages requesting comment. The pinnacle of Amazon is an elite group known as the S-team, roughly 16 senior executives, fewer than a dozen of whom report directly to Jeff Bezos, the company's chief executive. Just one member of the S-team is a woman, Beth Galetti, Amazon's senior vice president for human resources, according to two of the three employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity. At Microsoft, in contrast, three of the 15 people who report to the company's chief executive, Satya Nadella, are women. At Apple, women will represent six of the 18 people who report to Tim Cook, the company's chief, as of later this month, when the company's new general counsel starts. Like other technology companies, Amazon has described improving the diversity of its work force as an important company goal. In a report on company diversity, Amazon says 61 percent of its work force and 75 percent of its managers are men. Those figures, though, include the huge numbers of workers in Amazon's warehouses, where women are better represented than at other parts of the company. In August, at a staff meeting for Amazon employees held at a basketball arena, Mr. Bezos was asked about the dearth of diversity — implying gender and race — on his senior leadership team. Amazon employees applauded loudly at the question. Mr. Bezos replied that diversity was important at Amazon, according to two of the employees who would speak only on the condition of anonymity. But Mr. Bezos said that adding more diversity to the leadership team would happen slowly because of low turnover in its ranks — an answer that left many employees disappointed. One of the Amazon employees, who recently looked at an organizational chart, said Amazon's S-team members and the people who report directly to them amount to roughly 90 people, about 75 of whom are men. Amazon has taken some steps in recent years to make working at the company more appealing to women. Two years ago, it instituted a more generous maternity leave policy, providing birth mothers with up to 20 weeks of paid leave. But the company's office culture still has a hard-charging reputation that could make it harder to recruit more women. Textio, a Seattle start-up that uses software to analyze language, has examined public job postings for all the major internet companies. The company found that the language in Amazon's skewed most sharply to the masculine end of the spectrum, with frequent use of words like ""wickedly,"" ""insane"" and ""maniacal."" Kieran Snyder, the co-founder and chief executive of Textio, worked at Amazon for about six months. ""I would say Amazon has a reputation in the industry for being a very aggressive culture,"" she said."
2,2017-10-20," On the list of companies I dislike, Amazon ranks near the top, for putting bookstores out of business everywhere and destroying the ability of authors and publishers to earn a living. Having fed itself to monstrous size on such small potatoes, the company has now moved on to gut the rest of Main Street retail and cut the heart out of communities everywhere. And yet I shop at Amazon. My lame excuse is that it's now a 25-minute drive to the nearest independent bookstore, it's convenient to have a book turn up at my door, and the price looks right. This inconsistency isn't just an issue for left-leaners like me. Starbucks faced a right-wing boycott early this year when it responded to President Trump's immigration ban with a pledge to hire 10,000 refugees. But new research by Brayden King at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management shows ""zero correlation"" between public commitments to that boycott and subsequent purchasing behavior by pro-Trump consumers. That is, our failure to vote with our wallets crosses political lines. (United at last!) Withholding our cash from companies that cause harm or behave badly is one of the few avenues of protest we have as consumers. So why are we so bad at boycotting? There are hundreds of explanations for our inconsistency, according to Julie Irwin, a professor at the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas, Austin, who studies ethical consumerism. ""It's just really hard to think about this stuff,"" she said. ""It's uncomfortable; people need to get on with their day. It's not that they don't care. People who care more are often more inconsistent with their values. It just upsets them more."" One problem with boycotts is that they generally start with a company employee blurting out some egregious offense to our sensibilities. Usually it's the dimwit chief executive opening his mouth to expose his reptilian brain. Think about Guido Barilla publicly scoffing in 2013 at the notion that his company, the world's largest pasta maker, would ever feature a same-sex family in its advertising. Or recollect almost anything that the former Uber boss Travis Kalanick has ever said or done. The resulting boycotts may seem effective. Mr. Kalanick was out of a job soon after the #DeleteUber campaign early this year. And the furor against Barilla didn't just elicit a mortified apology from Mr. Barilla. His company also undertook enough remedial action to earn a 100 rating just a year later in the Human Rights Campaign's annual Corporate Equality Index. (It's still at 100 today.) But these success stories typically have less to do with consumer purchasing power than with the sharp bite of bad publicity. Outrageous remarks by executives tend, in any case, to be largely a distraction. They catch our attention and trigger our emotions. Meanwhile, we get bored and look away from the dull crimes companies commit every day, like Wells Fargo foisting phony accounts and unwanted auto insurance on its customers. Like Mylan gouging patients and government health care programs with a 500 percent markup on EpiPens. Like Volkswagen selling ""clean diesel"" cars that ran clean only long enough to fool emissions testing equipment. Like Exxon funding climate change disinformation. We are terrible, that is, at boycotting business as usual. Ms. Irwin admits, for instance, to having test-driven an Audi, manufactured by Volkswagen, after the 2015 revelation that the company systematically cheated its customers on ""clean"" diesel: ""The sales guy said, 'What do you think?' and I said, 'I like it. But I'm mad at you guys,"" and he said, 'No, that was VW.' He was trying to help me have that cognitive inconsistency, because we like to have these excuses so we don't have to worry about it."" She didn't buy it. But plenty of other customers did. Heavy discounting helped make scandal-ridden Volkswagen the world's largest automaker in 2016. We do better, Ms. Irwin says, when our ethical issues happen to line up with things we don't actually like. ""Then we can say, 'Oh, I never eat liver,' "" she said. So how do we make our boycotts more effective? How do we avoid wasting energy on the foot-in-mouth moments of dunderheaded executives and instead act on weightier issues? One answer is to accept that boycotts are about publicity, not consumer choice, and advertise wonky ethical positions like any other product: in vivid emotional terms. The film ""Blackfish"" didn't just attack SeaWorld for keeping orca whales in captivity. It made Tilikum, taken from the wild in 1983 and kept in captivity until his death early this year, the personification — the whale-ification — of that issue. Likewise, Jimmy Kimmel didn't just add another set of charts to the health insurance debate. He held up a picture of his infant son born with a heart defect and reshaped the debate in terms of how proposed changes would affect kids like his. Large-scale institutional forces can also ameliorate the frustrated consumer's abiding sense of inconsistency. I can't swear off heating oil just yet, but I can support the fossil fuel divestment campaign, which has persuaded institutions worth $5.5 trillion to shed at least some fossil fuel investments. I can also divest individually, in my retirement account, with the help of socially responsible mutual funds, which have lately proliferated, some with impressive results. (The website Fossil Free Funds allows investors to scan their holdings for hidden fossil fuel investments. And it's not just about climate change: A start-up called Motif Investing now also enables investors to construct a portfolio aligned more or less precisely with their individual values.) Am I actually doing these things? Only partly. I have begun the process with my retirement account and will complete it by year's end. I'm not under the delusion that the investment choices of people like me are going to cause financial harm to socially irresponsible companies, any more than participating in a boycott would. But I like the idea of helping to move those companies into the pariah class. It's partly about helping me sleep better. But mostly, it's about making the managers of those companies sleep worse."
0,2017-10-22," SINGAPORE — From this concrete warehouse perched on the edge of a potentially vast new market for online shopping, the Alibaba Group of China hopes to beat Amazon one head of lettuce at a time. Under the glare of fluorescent lights, green-vested workers carefully wrap fruit, cheese and other perishables for delivery by vans to a growing group of Singaporeans who prefer to do their shopping online. On a nearby wall, printouts show the sorts of defects that customers have complained about in the past: overripe avocados, smelly spinach, rotten honeydews. ""It's getting better and better,"" said Vikram Rupani, president of RedMart, an online grocery company based in Singapore that is part of Alibaba's push into the region, ""but it's a continuous process that never ends."" Alibaba and Amazon already dominate the business of selling stuff online in their home markets. Increasingly, they are competing against each other on neutral ground. Both are spending billions of dollars on Asia — particularly Southeast Asia and India — as they look for a place that could repeat China's explosive transformation into the world's biggest online shopping market. Amazon has committed $5 billion to India, where it lures customers to sign up for its Prime service, which includes Western movies and television shows, for a small fraction of the $99 annual membership price in the United States. Alibaba has invested roughly $500 million for stakes in both Paytm — India's largest mobile payments platform — and its e-commerce affiliate, Paytm Mall. Alibaba's bigger bet is in Southeast Asia. It has spent more than $2 billion to take control of Lazada, a five-year-old online shopping company based in Singapore and doing business in six countries. Last year, Lazada bought RedMart, the online retail grocery. The promise is there, as the region's young middle class grows and goes online. Southeast Asia's e-commerce sales could total $88 billion by 2025, according to projections from Google and Temasek Holdings, the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund. Volume was less than one-tenth that in 2015. Over about the same period, India's market could increase six times to a similar amount, Bain & Company, a consulting firm, projects. Alibaba and Amazon are seeking consumers like Janice Lee Fang, a Singaporean who decided she needed to buy a robot to amuse a 6-year-old daughter home sick from school. Through Amazon's Prime Now service, introduced in Singapore in July, she bought a Sphero SPRK Plus — a clear plastic ball that can skitter across the floor with a tap of a smartphone — that arrived in less than a day. ""I was thrilled,"" said Ms. Fang, who said she also uses Alibaba's services. ""I had time to unbox it and teach her how to use it. It's a last-minute shopping savior."" But Southeast Asia is no China. A diffuse area of 600 million people, the region is divided by politics, language and culture. Some places are modern, like Singapore. Other places lack the roads and other infrastructure to get people what they need. ""It's a mix of urban, semi-urban and rural areas, separated by large distances and — in the Philippines and Indonesia — by water,"" said Mike Booker, a partner at the Southeast Asian arm of Bain. ""Cash on delivery is still prevalent, and other local players are in the fray."" The challenges have forced Lazada, Alibaba's biggest Southeast Asian operation, to get creative. In Vietnam, local post offices take customer returns and give cash refunds. In Malaysia, customers can collect merchandise from lockers at 7-Eleven stores. And in the Philippines, Lazada uses gas stations as places where merchants can drop off their goods for delivery personnel to pick up. ""We're in the super, super, super early days,"" said Inanc Balci, who oversees Lazada operations in the Philippines. Alibaba's international arm has seen its latest quarterly sales more than double in a year, in part from Lazada's contribution. Still, Lazada and its RedMart subsidiary remain a tiny, and unprofitable, part of Alibaba's empire. Max Bittner, Lazada's chief executive, said its Chinese parent has been willing to spend money to build its delivery capabilities and draw more customers. ""E-commerce is an economy of scale game,"" Mr. Bittner said. ""I don't feel constrained in any way. I can go after this opportunity with the amount of firepower I need."" Amazon so far counts Singapore as its only Southeast Asian market, though industry experts widely expect it will expand into other countries. An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment. Until recently, direct competition between Alibaba and Amazon has been rare. Amazon has a modest presence in China. Alibaba sells goods in the United States through its AliExpress platform but has backed away from further expansion efforts. Southeast Asia could offer a test of their vastly different business models on neutral turf. Amazon owns more of the inventory it sells. By contrast, most of Lazada's sales come from outside vendors who use its platform as a digital middleman to reach customers. That approach, which keeps costs low, is similar to what Alibaba does in China. But in China, the company's Taobao platform has been accused of offering counterfeit goods. Alibaba says it is working to fight fakes. Alibaba has a long lead over Amazon and is building up its infrastructure across Southeast Asia. In Indonesia, for example, it took a minority stake in August in another online marketplace, Tokopedia. Experts say Amazon could fight back by offering online Western movies and television programs as it does in the United States, which could increase its appeal with younger customers. Amazon stumbled in Singapore initially when the service proved too popular, forcing it to turn away customers. But since then the two companies have amped up their efforts to deliver more quickly to a growing group of customers. At the RedMart warehouse on a recent visit, workers packed cartons — sometimes nine at a time — from bins holding piles of cereal boxes and canned fruits and vegetables. For those who offer ways to improve the process, merit awards include movie tickets, vouchers and cash of up to $1,000. Competing in the market is likely to be expensive, thanks to customer price cuts and rebates in addition to expansion costs. ""It's fabulous,"" said Uma Parameswar, a Singaporean who works in fine arts management. Over two and a half years of using RedMart, she said, only once did she receive fruit that was less than fresh. The enticements make her even more inclined to shop online. She says RedMart gives her a 5 percent discount on grocery bills plus discounts on using Uber's ride-hailing and other services. ""It's saved me probably $200 in the last three or four months,"" she said. ""It's a fair bit."""
0,2017-10-23," SEATTLE — Amazon said on Monday it got a total of 238 proposals from cities and regions across North America that want to be the home of its proposed second headquarters. The bids, received by last Thursday's deadline, came from so many places across the continent that it's perhaps simpler to note the ones that didn't fall over themselves to woo Amazon. The company did not provide a list, but a color-coded map posted on its website revealed the applicants came from all but seven American states — North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, Vermont, Arkansas and Hawaii. In Canada, Yukon Territory and the provinces of Saskatchewan and New Brunswick were among those that said no thanks. In Mexico, on the other hand, Amazon's map shows just three applications, from the states of Chihuahua, Hidalgo and Querétaro. In all, Amazon said the proposals came from 54 states, provinces, districts and territories (including Puerto Rico). The company has said it will announce its decision sometime next year. When Amazon announced on Sept. 7 that it was taking bids for a second headquarters, which it calls HQ2, it kicked off weeks of chest-thumping, publicity stunts and prostration by cities and regions eager to lure the 50,000 high-paying jobs Amazon has promised for the new campus. The mayor of Washington, D.C., made a goofy viral video in which she sought to butter up Amazon by having a faux conversation with Alexa, Amazon's intelligent assistant. Tucson sent a 21-foot-tall saguaro cactus on a flatbed truck to Amazon in Seattle. In perhaps the most unusual offer, Calgary  offered in newspaper ads and banners to fight a bear to win Amazon's new headquarters. While the bidding frenzy has prompted weeks of free publicity for Amazon, the process has also sparked criticism of Amazon's request that applicants include tax breaks and other incentives available to sweeten their proposals, derided by some as a form of corporate welfare. New Jersey has floated the idea of providing $7 billion in state and city tax incentives to bring Amazon to Newark. A few applicants went in the opposite direction and sought to highlight their decision to not bid on Amazon's second headquarters. A business group in Little Rock, Ark., recently took out a newspaper ad (in The Washington Post, owned by Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos) and created an internet video telling Amazon it didn't want the traffic hassles its new headquarters would bring to town. Arkansas is the home state of Amazon's archrival, Walmart."
0,2017-10-24," For the modest warehouse, this is a golden age. Boxy, unadorned and often overlooked, these properties are suddenly in hot demand in many parts of the country, thanks in part to a rise in e-commerce as consumer shopping habits move online. Retailers like Amazon and Walmart are snapping up space once reserved for makers of office furniture and home flooring. For years now, consumers have been purchasing more products online. In the second quarter, e-commerce sales topped more than $111 billion on a seasonally adjusted basis, or 8.9 percent of all retail sales, according to the Census Bureau. Industry forecasters expect e-commerce sales to continue growing. Warehouses often reveal little about what goes on within their walls, but the buildings make possible the rapid delivery that consumers now expect from online retailers. They serve as storage and distribution points for products ranging from auto parts to pharmaceuticals. And warehouse jobs have grown rapidly since 2010, forming a critical part of the employment base in communities across the country. As developers try to catch up, they are considering some unusual solutions, like constructing multistory warehouses and demolishing struggling malls to make way for sprawling industrial properties. ""This is the best I've seen it in my 35-year career,"" said Craig S. Meyer, president of the logistics and industrial services group for the Americas at the commercial real estate company JLL. There is relatively little in the way of available warehouse space for rent in many metropolitan regions, especially along the coasts, where land is at a premium. Nationwide, the vacancy rate stood at 5.2 percent at the end of September, lower than the average rate of 8.1 percent over the previous decade, according to JLL. Asking rental rates hit a high of $5.40 per square foot this fall. Just outside of Cincinnati, two real estate development companies, Al. Neyer and the Hillwood Development Company, recently put the finishing touches on a development called the Hebron Logistics Center. Located on a 49-acre property a few miles from the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport in Hebron, Ky., the project includes a pair of huge buildings, the larger of which covers more than 589,000 square feet — the equivalent of about 10 football fields — and has 36-foot-high ceilings. The smaller structure measures around 209,500 square feet. Both buildings, built on speculation that tenants will emerge, are vacant. The developers are betting that with the Cincinnati-area warehouse vacancy rate standing at 3.1 percent as of September, according to JLL's data, tenants will be eager to move in. The site's proximity to the airport and the area's highway network could be draws for tenants, too. ""Cincinnati has historically had low vacancy rates,"" said Molly North, chief executive at Al. Neyer. ""Certainly, from a developer's perspective, this calls for more supply. I think it's also an indication that, as developers, we haven't kept up with demand in the market."" Before the project in Hebron, Al. Neyer had not developed a warehouse property in the Cincinnati area since 2007, according to Ms. North. As the economy softened, leasing that development was a challenge. The company focused on other real estate projects instead. Now, the company wants back in the market. Even as they try to lease the Hebron project, Al. Neyer and Hillwood have bought another parcel close to the region's airport and plan to build two more buildings with 1.7 million square feet between them. Construction on the first building is set to begin next April. Part of the reason the companies think they can eventually fill around 2.5 million square feet of space is because of Amazon's plans for the Cincinnati airport, which it will use as an airfreight hub with as many as 2,000 employees. ""We already liked the market before that,"" said Kurt Nelson, senior vice president at Hillwood. ""But I think it just adds another piece, another opportunity."" Amazon is having an outsize effect on warehouse developers. By the end of the year, Amazon will rent an estimated 114 million square feet of warehouse space, up from about nine million in 2009, according to a June note from Jonathan Petersen, an analyst at investment bank Jefferies who follows industrial property companies. But Amazon faces some competition for warehouse space. Walmart, for example, has increased the number of large distribution centers that support its online sales. And e-commerce operations require three times the amount of warehouse space that brick-and-mortar stores need, analysts say, to guarantee that inventory is on hand and returns can be processed. That means companies with online shopping platforms are going to be on the hunt. ""The last thing that caused a big difference, and this is more macro, was just the growth in trade, the growth in port markets and the move toward distribution and warehousing along the coasts,"" Mr. Petersen said in an interview. ""Then out of nowhere, you have this e-commerce trend. That continues to boost the sector and drive growth."" This year, developers are expected to build about 225 million new square feet of warehouse space, according to JLL, about the same as last year's tally and more than double the 10-year average of 120 million square feet. One challenge for many builders is finding development sites in or close to dense, built-up cities, where land is often scarce. E-commerce companies need such parcels to guarantee they can quickly dispatch orders to homes and businesses. Prologis, a San Francisco-based real estate investment trust that owns 380 million square feet of industrial property in the United States, is trying to solve the land riddle by constructing modern multistory warehouses — at least in some markets. These types of properties are not uncommon in cities like Hong Kong and Tokyo, but they are nonexistent here. A property Prologis is building in Seattle will be the first contemporary multistory warehouse in the United States, according to the company. The building, called Prologis Georgetown Crossroads and located about four miles south of downtown Seattle, will span 590,000 square feet over three levels. When complete, it will have two floors designated for product fulfillment. A ramp will wind around one side of the building, allowing trucks to drive to the second floor, pick up or drop off goods and then leave in an efficient manner. The top level could host offices or even a light manufacturing operation. Multistory warehouses are unproven in the United States, but potential tenants for the Seattle property have been receptive to the idea, said Larry Harmsen, chief operating officer for the Americas at Prologis. The company also plans to develop such a property in San Francisco. ""They're not just crazy experiments,"" he said. ""We're not going to do these everywhere. These really only work in high-density, highly land-constrained environments,"" Mr. Harmsen said. ""The land economics have to be high enough."" The boom in warehouses could even spell the end for long-struggling retail properties. In Frackville, Pa., about 60 miles northeast of Harrisburg, the state capital, the real estate company NorthPoint Development believes industrial buildings are a better use than a moribund mall. NorthPoint wants to demolish the mostly empty 800,000-square-foot Schuylkill Mall in Frackville, replacing the retail property with two new warehouses that will have more than 1.2 million square feet between them, according to Brian Hansbury, vice president at the Schuylkill Economic Development Corporation. Schuylkill Mall opened in 1980 and once had four anchor retail tenants, including a now-closed Sears and a Hess's. But the mall has been in decline for years, hurt in part by the rise of online retailers, according to Mr. Hansbury. Later this year, NorthPoint will demolish the property, clearing the land for the warehouses it wants to build, he said. Mr. Hansbury thinks the larger of the two buildings planned for the property could work as an e-commerce distribution center. It would be ironic, of course, if an e-commerce company, the type of which helped make the mall obsolete, ended up with an operation on the site. ""It really is kind of a full circle development that's going on,"" Mr. Hansbury said. ""I can see why some people would be disappointed that they no longer have a mall, but I think what we're left with might even be better."""
0,2017-10-25," WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday loosened some rules for commercial drones, including for package deliveries, by allowing broader testing by companies like Amazon and Wing, a part of Alphabet. Mr. Trump signed an executive memorandum to allow more companies to test their flying machines at night, above people, at far greater distances and with packages — activities limited by federal restrictions. The Transportation Department will work with states, towns and tribal communities to create pilot programs, the White House said. For example, a drone maker like DJI could apply with a town to test drone deliveries from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. The pilot programs are expected to be put in place within one year. The announcement is a victory for tech companies that have bet that drone deliveries will be a part of retail in the future, as well as entertainment companies that want to use the machines for filming. Amazon, Google, DJI, Intel and Hollywood lobbied the Obama administration to ease rules on commercial unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones. Amazon even proposed a future highway system in the sky, in which lower altitudes would be reserved for lighter weight drones that could deliver packages. But the Transportation Department has proceeded cautiously around allowing the machines to integrate into airspace shared by planes. Lawmakers and public interest groups have also raised concerns about privacy. Many questions remain about the program announced on Wednesday, including how many drones could be part of pilot programs. The Federal Aviation Administration is still deliberating potential rules for commercial drones, which are expected to have far more impact on the industry than Wednesday's executive memorandum. The White House said the approach taken by the United States until now has put the country behind other nations on technology innovation. Wing is testing in Australia, Amazon in Britain and Zipline in Rwanda, said Michael Kratsios, the deputy assistant to the president at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. ""To maintain U.S. leadership, our country needs a regulatory framework,"" Mr. Kratsios said."
1,2017-10-25," SEATTLE — For many online shoppers, packages often linger for distressingly long hours outside their homes, where they can be stolen or soaked by rain. Now, if customers give it permission, Amazon's couriers will unlock the front doors and drop packages inside when no one is home. What could possibly go wrong? The head spins with the opportunities for mischief in letting a stranger into an empty home. There are risks for couriers too — whether it's an attacking dog or an escaping cat. To allay these concerns, Amazon is asking customers to trust it — buy a package of technology including an internet-connected smart lock and an indoor security camera. Amazon isn't the only business that believes this is the future of internet shopping, as well as other services that require home access, like dog walking and house keeping. This summer, a start-up that makes smart locks, Latch, struck a deal with Jet.com, an online shopping site owned by Walmart, to jointly pay for the installation of its locks on 1,000 apartment buildings in New York City to make deliveries easier. The arrangement offers some of the security of a doorman for people who live in buildings without them. E-commerce companies have experimented with ways of making deliveries more secure for years. Amazon installs self-service lockers in office buildings and outside supermarkets where customers can fetch their orders, and Daimler and other carmakers have tested the delivery of goods from Amazon and other retailers to customers' car trunks. The costs of package theft aren't known — Amazon, for example, will not say — but are probably substantial. Most people who have spent any time on a neighborhood blog, social network or email list have a sense of how prevalent such crime is. And packages sitting on front porches can also signal to anyone who walks by that the homeowners are away. Ryan Calo, a law professor at the University of Washington who specializes in legal issues related to technology, said Amazon's new service relies on the same kind of trust homeowners commonly extend to services to which they hand over their keys. But he said those agreements often involve in-person interactions, which won't happen when homeowners allow Amazon to unlock its doors. ""It raises questions about how do you specify and police expectations when the relationship is one mediated almost entirely by technology?"" Mr. Calo said. Amazon's new service, Amazon Key, will require customers to buy a kit that starts at $250 and includes a security camera made by the company and a smart door lock made by Yale or Kwikset. When a delivery comes to a customer's door, the lock first helps Amazon verify that the driver is at the correct address at the appropriate time. It then starts recording video and unlocks the door, capturing the entire visit. ""Customers told us they really want to understand and see what's happening when deliveries are happening,"" said Charlie Tritschler, vice president for Amazon devices. ""It gives them assurance."" Amazon is also offering the camera, called Amazon Cloud Cam, as a stand-alone product for $120, significantly less than other internet-connected cameras. Amazon says it will guarantee protection for customers in the event a driver damages or steals something inside a home. It suggests homeowners keep pets away from front doors when deliveries are expected. If drivers can't safely make deliveries, they'll leave packages outside. The company said Amazon Key will be available in 37 cities in the United States starting Nov. 8 and open to its Prime members, who pay $99 a year for fast shipping and other benefits. The system can also be used to grant home access to other services, such as Merry Maids, a housecleaning provider, and Rover.com, a dog-walking site. Luke Schoenfelder, the chief executive and co-founder of Latch, the start-up working with Jet.com, said it has initially focused on installing smart locks on the front doors of apartment buildings to allow deliveries to building lobbies, rather than inside the apartments themselves. Allowing couriers inside apartments has more risks, but Latch plans to eventually do that as well. ""It certainly has a lot more challenges,"" he said. ""Pets are the biggest one."" Still, he predicted that the strangeness of allowing companies like Latch and Amazon to unlock front doors will go away as customers get more accustomed to the services, in the same way they got more comfortable stepping into a stranger's car they had summoned with Uber or Lyft. ""The world is absolutely going there,"" Mr. Schoenfelder said."
2,2017-10-25," SAN FRANCISCO — Google and Cisco Systems, two trendsetters in different eras of the internet, are joining forces as the growth of cloud computing puts new pressure on big tech companies and leads to strange corporate bedfellows. The Silicon Valley giants on Wednesday announced a collaboration to help companies manage software and technology services that may run in their own data centers or in facilities operated by external cloud services. Google, the largest unit of its parent, Alphabet, hopes to benefit from Cisco's close ties to corporate customers as the search engine giant tries to catch up to Amazon, the market leader in cloud services, and Microsoft. Cisco could also use some help. The tech giant, which in 2000 briefly became the world's most valuable publicly traded company when its computer networking equipment was used to build the internet, faces a serious threat from cloud services. Companies that once spent heavily on new hardware from Cisco and other suppliers increasingly rent cloud services instead, with companies like Amazon doing most of the heavy lifting in the background. ""Every company that built an empire on selling equipment to companies to put in their data centers is feeling incredible pressure,"" said Dave Bartoletti, a vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research, a market research firm. Cisco has also faced stiffening competition from rivals like the software maker VMware, which announced a partnership with Amazon last year. Cisco and Google executives vowed to offer something different. They said companies have been struggling with the fact that they need separate tools to manage software on their own premises and those running in the cloud, a situation that sometimes causes security problems. By combining Google programming technology and Cisco networking and security software, they said, tech managers can create and manage software that can run securely in or outside their companies' data centers. The idea, said Urs Hölzle, Google's senior vice president for technical infrastructure, is to close those ""security gaps."" Cloud computing has been roiling the strategies of older tech companies for much of the past decade. The concept, besides letting customers sidestep the costs of buying hardware and software, can let companies deploy computing resources more quickly and flexibly. Amazon Web Services pioneered the concept. Synergy Research Group, a market research firm, said in July that A.W.S. accounted for 34 percent of the roughly $11 billion spent on such cloud services in the second quarter, compared with 11 percent for Microsoft, 8 percent for IBM and 5 percent for Google. Amazon and Microsoft are expected to highlight progress in their cloud businesses when they report quarterly earnings on Thursday. Google has moved aggressively to catch up. In late 2015, the company gave the job of running its cloud business to Diane Greene, a widely respected Silicon Valley entrepreneur who helped make VMware's technology a mainstay at many corporations. She made a series of organizational changes, recruited new talent and introduced new technology features. In one important move, Google in September 2016 bought the start-up Apigee Corporation for $625 million, adding capabilities to help customers connect their operations with online services operated by others. More mature technology companies have taken different tacks to try to hold on to customers. Some, like IBM and Oracle, offer their own cloud services. Others, like Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Dell Technologies, have shied away from engaging in a spending war in data centers against deep-pocketed internet giants. So has Cisco. The company, based in San Jose, Calif., promoted a concept called ""intercloud"" that amounted to coordinating a federation of cloud services operated by partners. But Cisco dropped that approach last year, choosing instead to help customers manage ""hybrid"" cloud arrangements — industry parlance for using a blend of operations in a company's own data centers and those operated by a growing number of cloud services. ""We think we are one of the few companies that can navigate this multi-cloud world,"" said David Goeckeler, executive vice president and general manager of Cisco's networking and security business. The company has broadly signaled plans to rely more on software and services than on sales of networking hardware, aided frequently by acquisitions. On Monday, for example, Cisco said it would pay $1.9 billion for BroadSoft, which sells online communications services. Other companies also have embraced the hybrid cloud concept. Microsoft, for example, has longtime ties with corporate software buyers and has come up with ways to run new cloud applications in its data centers or on customers' premises, said Al Gillen, an analyst at the research firm IDC. ""We see other vendors doing things to compete since what we have is so strong and so unique,"" said Julia White, a corporate vice president with Microsoft's Azure cloud business. VMware, a subsidiary of Dell, was first known for software technology called virtualization that allows more efficient use of servers but now competes with Cisco with networking software. Russ Currie, a vice president of enterprise strategy at the network monitoring specialist NetScout Systems, said VMware was effectively using its cloud alliance with A.W.S. to court customers. Pat Gelsinger, VMware's chief executive, called the announcement from Google and Cisco a ""validation"" of his own company's vision. Cisco also cooperates in various ways with A.W.S. and Microsoft in cloud computing. But Mr. Goeckeler said that the Google relationship was particularly potent because of the technological specialties of each company. ""We are both users of each other's products,"" said Mr. Hölzle of Google. But in this case, this is about working together to give their customers the technology they want, he said."
0,2017-10-26," Amazon said this week it had received proposals from 238 cities and regions across North America that are vying for its new, second headquarters, called HQ2. No wonder: With a prize of 50,000 high-paying jobs, a promised $5 billion in construction spending and the prestige of having a headquarters for one of the world's fastest-growing, best-known tech companies, the contest is vastly more important than a World Series or Super Bowl. Although Amazon has stressed that it is approaching the process with no preconceived ideas and has just begun reviewing the applications, that hasn't stopped a nationwide parlor game of picking a winner. Moody's Analytics has already crowned Austin, Tex. The New York Times Upshot chose Denver. Amazon will probably narrow the list to a group of finalists before conducting site visits and meeting with elected officials and community leaders. It has said it expects to reach a decision next year. Still, Amazon's stated objectives and past behavior — along with interviews with people working with the company on the selection process (none of whom were willing to be named because of their Amazon ties) and corporate governance and location experts — yield some insights into what factors the retailer values most highly and where the new headquarters may end up. (An Amazon spokesman declined to comment.) First on Amazon's list of ""key preferences and decision drivers"" is ""site/building,"" which the company describes as being of ""paramount importance."" This means far more than an attractive building or campus. Amazon prides itself on having its existing headquarters embedded in the urban fabric of Seattle. Just this month, the company said it would take over the top six floors of the Macy's department store downtown — a move rich in irony, given how Macy's has struggled in competing with online retailers — and it will occupy all of the office space at the Rainier Square development that is planned for the city's downtown area. The idea of inhabiting the sort of self-contained suburban corporate parks so common in Silicon Valley seems anathema to Amazon. The company has said that 20 percent of its employees in Seattle don't use motorized transport to get to work. Fifty-five percent walk, ride bikes or use public transportation. Fifteen percent live in the ZIP code where they work. Amazon deliberately provides cafeteria space for only a third of its employees, which encourages people to venture out of the office. The company provides retail space on the ground floor of its Seattle buildings and tries not to rent to generic national chains (its headquarters has a dozen local coffee roasters.) It has developed a sense of the kind of urban community that attracts and retains highly educated, talented and creative workers. In practical terms, this kind of dense, vibrant and architecturally distinctive urban environment exists mostly in cities that developed before the advent of the automobile, industrial cities in the Midwest and Northeast and older cities in Canada. The Alliance for Biking and Walking has ranked American cities based on the percentage of people who walk or ride bikes to work. In order, they are Boston, Washington, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, Ore., New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Chicago and Baltimore. Cities like Pittsburgh, Detroit and Baltimore are rich in underutilized historic buildings and neighborhoods that could be imaginatively repurposed, offering Amazon the opportunity to be a transformative force, something that seems to be part of the company's DNA. New York, Chicago, Boston and Washington already have vibrant urban centers, not that they couldn't be improved. They are also the kinds of places where local opposition to Amazon's potential arrival would be more likely, based on factors like the impact on their already congested streets and criticism of the company's workplace practices. Cyril Bouquet, a professor at IMD, an international business school in Lausanne, Switzerland, and an expert in companies with dual headquarters, said the choice of a second headquarters sends an important symbolic message. ""Amazon has the opportunity to help build and shape a city and region,"" he said. ""That's easier in a Detroit than a San Francisco. It's much different than just tapping the talent that's already there. Amazon will attract people and other companies that are inspired by that."" Next on Amazon's wish list are capital and operating costs"" and ""incentives,"" which Amazon identifies as ""high priority"" considerations. That is as it should be, said Charles M. Elson, a professor and director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. ""Amazon's first obligation is to its investors,"" Professor Elson said, which means finding ""the most cost-effective city in which to locate a second headquarters,"" one that ""will produce the most value for the company."" Most contenders have been secretive about their bids, but the incentives will probably be substantial. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and state lawmakers, for instance, have offered a $7 billion package of tax breaks on behalf of Newark. Any city that really wants Amazon will have to ante up, and most will find the wherewithal to do so. The accounting and consulting firm KPMG ranks major cities by costs in its biennial ""Competitive Alternatives"" survey. A score of 100 is equal to the United States baseline, so costs in a city with a score of 105 are 5 percent higher than the baseline; cities with a score of 95 are 5 percent lower. New York City, with a score of 104.7, and San Francisco (104.5) are two of the most expensive cities in the country, making them long shots. (Seattle, at 100.8, is just above the baseline.) Boston, at 101.2, would probably barely make the cut. Washington's score is 99.4. The lowest-cost American cities are mostly in the Sunbelt; Austin's score is 96.2. But many older industrial cities also offer cost advantages: Cincinnati (94), Baltimore (96.5), Pittsburgh (97), Chicago (98.3) and Philadelphia (99.8) are all below the baseline. Thanks to the strong dollar (which could change over time), Canadian cities fare especially well: Montreal's score is 85.2; Toronto's is 85.6. Both cities also have vibrant urban cores and have emphasized Canada's talent-friendly immigration policies. ""Labor Force"" is third on Amazon's list. The company appears to be bumping up against the limits of Seattle's talent pool. The commercial real estate firm CBRE produces an annual ranking of cities based on what it calls ""tech talent,"" which considers factors like technology positions as a percentage of all jobs, growth in tech jobs and tech-degree completion. The top cities on that list are San Francisco and the Bay Area, Seattle and New York — no surprises there. But other cities also fare well: Washington is No. 4, Toronto is No. 6, Boston is No. 9 and Baltimore is No. 11. Conversely, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Milwaukee and St. Louis all rank so low it is hard to see them as viable contenders. Detroit, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh fall somewhere in the middle, but could still be competitive. Amazon appears less concerned with how many tech workers already live and work in an area than with its ability to attract the talent it wants. Seattle was hardly a tech magnet before Amazon, Microsoft and then a host of once-fledgling technology firms set up operations there. Amazon expects its arrival in a new city to have a similar impact. Amazon adds that ""a strong university system is required."" Many contending cities offer first-rate universities, including highly ranked programs in technology. Boston is a standout, with Harvard, M.I.T., Boston College, Boston University, but Baltimore offers Johns Hopkins University and Toronto has the University of Toronto and York University. Amazon cites logistics as ""critically important,"" specifically the presence of an international airport that offers direct flights to Seattle, Washington, New York and San Francisco. (These cities are likely to have a large Amazon presence no matter who wins the competition for the second headquarters.) Virtually every major American airport could use an upgrade, but most big cities have international airports with many direct flights to the cities where Amazon does business. Pittsburgh lacks nonstop flights to Seattle and offers only limited nonstop service to international destinations. But the city was once a major hub for US Air, which made substantial investments in infrastructure there before it was taken over by American Airlines. The number of flights to and from Pittsburgh has dwindled since then, but they could easily be revived. In addition to major airports, Boston, Baltimore and Philadelphia are all on Amtrak's northeast rail corridor, with easy rail access to New York and Washington. ""Community cultural fit"" and ""community quality of life"" are last on Amazon's list of preferences. Along with the usual amenities, Amazon specifically mentions ""a diverse population"" and, again, ""excellent institutions of higher education."" If weather and independent coffee roasters are important, Austin would be a good fit. Most major cities offer an array of cultural, culinary, recreational and sports attractions, and any that they lack will most likely spring up if Amazon arrives. That puts a premium on diversity and education, factors important in attracting a talented work force. Given Amazon's vocal support for diversity and inclusion, it seems unlikely it would choose a city or state perceived as intolerant or that has moved to curb civil rights, like North Carolina's widely publicized effort to curb gay and transgender rights. There are obviously many variables still to be assessed, but based on these criteria and the weight I expect Amazon to place on them, here are my finalists, in descending order: Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Toronto, Chicago and Boston."
1,2017-10-26," Damien Cave, our Australia bureau chief, shares insights on global news, local recommendations and feedback from readers in this weekly newsletter. To receive it in your inbox, sign up here. ______ Just before I finished my story about Amazon's arrival in Australia and its possible impact on the book industry, I started to hear something familiar in the way bookstore owners and authors were talking about their resistance to the giant American retailer. Then it hit me. Isn't their intense opposition to Amazon's arrival just another version of the nationalist populism of Pauline Hanson and Donald J. Trump? What if the culture industry is for the intellectual left what factory jobs are for the populist right — a piece of the economy tied to identity and nostalgia that they just can't help but want preserved and protected at all costs? There are obviously differences between resistance to a large corporate behemoth like Amazon, and resistance to, say immigrants and refugees — big differences. But at some core human level, both are driven by fear of a future defined by outsiders, and a love for what is. I recognized the emotions I heard talking to bookstore owners and writers because it reminded me of the emotions I heard talking to working-class Americans as they struggled through the global financial crisis and its aftermath. In both cases, many of the people I talked to started with jabs of outrage only to end with sighs and worry. ""I wish I was more optimistic,"" said Suzy Wilson, the owner of Riverbend Books in Brisbane. ""What concerns me the most about the growing influence of corporations like Amazon is their worldview,"" said Tim Winton, the author of ""Cloudstreet"" and many other well-known novels. ""People who work in the book industry are agents of culture rather than just instruments of commerce."" That pessimism and the demand for a society built to a more human scale and tied more closely to identity and agency crosses ideological and international borders. It's Catalonia trying to split from Spain. It's Silicon Valley insiders calling for us all to turn off our smartphones. It's Steve Bannon and Brexit, yes, but it may also be Emmanuel Macron and Jacinda Ardern. Whether populism is the right word for this is an open question, but whatever it is, it may be the ""ism"" of our time — a messy mishmash of human urges seeking a middle ground after the Cold War battle between capitalism and communism. Maybe it's just a function of change, and a lot of it. A McKinsey Institute report from 2015 keeps coming back to me. It compared the current moment of globalization and technological change with the Industrial Revolution, and concluded that in this era, ""change is happening 10 times faster and at 300 times the scale, or roughly 3,000 times the impact."" If that assessment is accurate, the urge to pull inward and protect your own — regardless of your professed politics — starts to make more sense. Add to that the continued rise in influence of digital giants like Facebook, Google and Amazon (part of what our tech columnist has identified as ""the Frightful Five"") and it's hard to see a world in which the tensions between the local and the global diminish anytime soon. Some countries (Canada, for one) have mostly avoided the populist tilt that's careening through the developed world. The United States and England, meanwhile, are grappling with it every day. Where do you think Australia will end up falling on the spectrum between nationalism and globalism? And on a more personal note, where do you draw the line between openness to the world, and protection for the local? I'm convinced there's a lot to talk about with this subject, so tell me your thoughts at nytaustralia@nytimes.com. If you're a subscriber, join us in our Facebook group for more discussion. As always, we also hope you'll share this newsletter if you have friends who might also be interested and encourage them to sign up for my weekly missives. And now here are my picks of the week, a preview of our public event in Sydney this week with Joe Kahn, The New York Times's managing editor, and a recommendation for another newsletter we enjoy. ____ In addition to my Amazon story, our coverage since last week's newsletter included a look at the dangers facing refugees on Manus Island, and our Beijing bureau chief, Jane Perlez (a faithful Aussie), wrote about the ways that various countries, including Australia, are being vexed by China's rise. We also explored the triumph of Jacinda Ardern, the new prime minister of New Zealand, and the challenges she now faces with governing. On the lighter side, yes, we covered those Queenslanders in the crocodile trap. And for a regular feature about reporters and technology, here's what I've loved and loathed about getting our Sydney bureau up and running. (The gist: NBN bad, Gumtree good.) One more thing: be sure to check nytimes.com/au tomorrow for the first review from our new Australia restaurant critic. We're very excited to bring Times-ian food criticism to cities and towns all over the country — another new addition as we build out our team. ______ This stunning and heart-wrenching feature on teenage girls who were forced to become suicide bombers by Boko Haram in Nigeria will stay with you — because of both the words and photographs. The artful, intimate yet privacy-protecting images (including the one above) were shot by Adam Ferguson, the Aussie photographer responsible for our earlier interactive visual essay on the outback. And I'm happy to report that he'll be back soon for more arresting work from Australia, so stay tuned. ______ • The New York Times editorial board weighs in on the Adani coal mine, arguing that ""it's the opposite of what Australia, India or the rest of the world needs."" • Miguel Syjuco writes about the way fake news is damaging the Philippines. • Thomas Friedman tries to goad General Mattis into standing up to President Trump, writing: ""You need to lead McMaster, Tillerson and Kelly (Pompeo is a lost cause) in telling Trump that if he does not change his ways you will all quit, en masse."" ______ Joseph Kahn, the managing editor of The Times, is here in Sydney this week, and you're all invited to try and catch him in person or on the air. He'll be on ABC radio this afternoon, Thursday, around 4 p.m. On Friday, he'll present the Andrew Olle Media Lecture. On Monday at 3 p.m., he'll be discussing the challenges of running a newsroom in an era of digital disruption and President Trump at a public event at the University of Sydney with Simon Jackman of United States Studies Center. In between, he'll be doing a mix of public and private discussions... and perhaps a bit of surfing. ______ The Briefing, a daily newsletter from The Saturday Paper, regularly includes New York Times links, but that's not the only reason we like it. There are also links to stories we might have missed in other outlets from all over the world, and of course, some provocative commentary from The Saturday Paper, including this fascinating read from Richard Cooke, who explores why Milo Yiannopoulos has been focusing on Australia. He suggests that part of the reason is the Australian media — ""large, right-wing heavy, thin on talent,"" he writes — and because Australia still tends to ""seek endorsement, or at least attention"" from ""any outsider who can stomach 22 hours on a plane."" Agree or disagree, but sign up for the weekly edition, delivered Saturday, and the daily."

Given Amazon's vocal support for diversity and inclusion, it seems unlikely it would choose a city or state perceived as intolerant or that has moved to curb civil rights, like North Carolina's widely publicized effort to curb gay and transgender rights. There are obviously many variables still to be assessed, but based on these criteria and the weight I expect Amazon to place on them, here are my finalists, in descending order: Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Toronto, Chicago and Boston."

To receive it in your inbox, sign up here. ______ Just before I finished my story about Amazon's arrival in Australia and its possible impact on the book industry, I started to hear something familiar in the way bookstore owners and authors were talking about their resistance to the giant American retailer. Then it hit me. Isn't their intense opposition to Amazon's arrival just another version of the nationalist populism of Pauline Hanson and Donald J. Trump? What if the culture industry is for the intellectual left what factory jobs are for the populist right — a piece of the economy tied to identity and nostalgia that they just can't help but want preserved and protected at all costs? There are obviously differences between resistance to a large corporate behemoth like Amazon, and resistance to, say immigrants and refugees — big differences. But at some core human level, both are driven by fear of a future defined by outsiders, and a love for what is. I recognized the emotions I heard talking to bookstore owners and writers because it reminded me of the emotions I heard talking to working-class Americans as they struggled through the global financial crisis and its aftermath. In both cases, many of the people I talked to started with jabs of outrage only to end with sighs and worry. ""I wish I was more optimistic,"" said Suzy Wilson, the owner of Riverbend Books in Brisbane. ""What concerns me the most about the growing influence of corporations like Amazon is their worldview,"" said Tim Winton, the author of ""Cloudstreet"" and many other well-known novels. ""People who work in the book industry are agents of culture rather than just instruments of commerce."" That pessimism and the demand for a society built to a more human scale and tied more closely to identity and agency crosses ideological and international borders. It's Catalonia trying to split from Spain. It's Silicon Valley insiders calling for us all to turn off our smartphones. It's Steve Bannon and Brexit, yes, but it may also be Emmanuel Macron and Jacinda Ardern. Whether populism is the right word for this is an open question, but whatever it is, it may be the ""ism"" of our time — a messy mishmash of human urges seeking a middle ground after the Cold War battle between capitalism and communism. Maybe it's just a function of change, and a lot of it. A McKinsey Institute report from 2015 keeps coming back to me. It compared the current moment of globalization and technological change with the Industrial Revolution, and concluded that in this era, ""change is happening 10 times faster and at 300 times the scale, or roughly 3,000 times the impact."" If that assessment is accurate, the urge to pull inward and protect your own — regardless of your professed politics — starts to make more sense. Add to that the continued rise in influence of digital giants like Facebook, Google and Amazon (part of what our tech columnist has identified as ""the Frightful Five"") and it's hard to see a world in which the tensions between the local and the global diminish anytime soon. Some countries (Canada, for one) have mostly avoided the populist tilt that's careening through the developed world. The United States and England, meanwhile, are grappling with it every day. Where do you think Australia will end up falling on the spectrum between nationalism and globalism? And on a more personal note, where do you draw the line between openness to the world, and protection for the local? I'm convinced there's a lot to talk about with this subject, so tell me your thoughts at nytaustralia@nytimes.com. If you're a subscriber, join us in our Facebook group for more discussion. As always, we also hope you'll share this newsletter if you have friends who might also be interested and encourage them to sign up for my weekly missives. And now here are my picks of the week, a preview of our public event in Sydney this week with Joe Kahn, The New York Times's managing editor, and a recommendation for another newsletter we enjoy. ____ In addition to my Amazon story, our coverage since last week's newsletter included a look at the dangers facing refugees on Manus Island, and our Beijing bureau chief, Jane Perlez (a faithful Aussie), wrote about the ways that various countries, including Australia, are being vexed by China's rise. We also explored the triumph of Jacinda Ardern, the new prime minister of New Zealand, and the challenges she now faces with governing. On the lighter side, yes, we covered those Queenslanders in the crocodile trap. And for a regular feature about reporters and technology, here's what I've loved and loathed about getting our Sydney bureau up and running. (The gist: NBN bad, Gumtree good.) One more thing: be sure to check nytimes.com/au tomorrow for the first review from our new Australia restaurant critic. We're very excited to bring Times-ian food criticism to cities and towns all over the country — another new addition as we build out our team. ______ This stunning and heart-wrenching feature on teenage girls who were forced to become suicide bombers by Boko Haram in Nigeria will stay with you — because of both the words and photographs. The artful, intimate yet privacy-protecting images (including the one above) were shot by Adam Ferguson, the Aussie photographer responsible for our earlier interactive visual essay on the outback. And I'm happy to report that he'll be back soon for more arresting work from Australia, so stay tuned. ______ • The New York Times editorial board weighs in on the Adani coal mine, arguing that ""it's the opposite of what Australia, India or the rest of the world needs."" • Miguel Syjuco writes about the way fake news is damaging the Philippines. • Thomas Friedman tries to goad General Mattis into standing up to President Trump, writing: ""You need to lead McMaster, Tillerson and Kelly (Pompeo is a lost cause) in telling Trump that if he does not change his ways you will all quit, en masse."" ______ Joseph Kahn, the managing editor of The Times, is here in Sydney this week, and you're all invited to try and catch him in person or on the air. He'll be on ABC radio this afternoon, Thursday, around 4 p.m. On Friday, he'll present the Andrew Olle Media Lecture. On Monday at 3 p.m., he'll be discussing the challenges of running a newsroom in an era of digital disruption and President Trump at a public event at the University of Sydney with Simon Jackman of United States Studies Center. In between, he'll be doing a mix of public and private discussions... and perhaps a bit of surfing. ______ The Briefing, a daily newsletter from The Saturday Paper, regularly includes New York Times links, but that's not the only reason we like it. There are also links to stories we might have missed in other outlets from all over the world, and of course, some provocative commentary from The Saturday Paper, including this fascinating read from Richard Cooke, who explores why Milo Yiannopoulos has been focusing on Australia. He suggests that part of the reason is the Australian media — ""large, right-wing heavy, thin on talent,"" he writes — and because Australia still tends to ""seek endorsement, or at least attention"" from ""any outsider who can stomach 22 hours on a plane.""

4,2017-10-26," The new Amazon series ""Fearless"" is a solid, atmospheric but unsurprising exercise in a British perennial: the old-boy's-club conspiracy thriller, in which an ordinary bloke discovers that the aristocrats and technocrats who run the country will go to murderous lengths to cover up their indiscretions. Superior versions include ""Edge of Darkness"" (1985, available on DVD) and the great ""State of Play"" (2003, streaming at Britbox). This new iteration was created and written by Patrick Harbinson, who has extensive experience in the more caffeinated American versions of these stories as a writer and producer on ""Homeland"" and ""24."" His primary innovation is to make the characters doing the dirty work women. Emma Banville (Helen McCrory), a crusading lawyer, uncovers what appears, in the three episodes available for review, to be a cover-up involving a murder and an American air base. She's opposed by American (Robin Weigert of ""Deadwood"") and British (Wunmi Mosaku) operatives who carry out their orders with varying degrees of enthusiasm. In trying to construct the layered plot a conspiracy tale requires, Mr. Harbinson piles on complications but doesn't really find a hook to pull us into the story. Emma, who's sheltering the wife of a British citizen suspected of terrorism, is already being watched by the British spy services when the series begins. Then she takes on the wrongful-conviction case of a man in prison for the murder of a teenage girl. This results in Emma and her very patient boyfriend having two houseguests who are both persons of interest to the government, a situation that serves a dramatic purpose but mostly just feels contrived. It doesn't help the story's believability that, in order to reinforce Emma's fearlessness on behalf of her clients, Mr. Harbinson exaggerates both the hatred she inspires (from the dead girl's family) and the malevolence of the government's opposition to levels that are excessive even for a paranoid thriller. If your appetite for dark tales of official malfeasance is strong, ""Fearless"" will go down easily enough, helped by the usual superior British cast — Jamie Bamber (""Battlestar Galactica"") pops up as a shifty member of Parliament and Michael Gambon drifts in and out as the master of the universe who's guilty of something that will presumably be revealed in Episode 6. If six hours is a tough ask, though, go straight to ""State of Play."""
0,2017-10-27," THE EXPLORER By Katherine Rundell 336 pp. Simon & Schuster. $16.99. (Middle grade; ages 8 to 12) Kids love an unfinished map. What's in those empty spots? Why does no one know? Can I be the one to go find out? Katherine Rundell's latest middle-grade novel, ""The Explorer,"" faces such enticing questions head on. After a plane crash, Fred is stranded in the Amazon jungle, where he will have to find shelter, food and — eventually — a way out. He's not alone: Stranded alongside the British schoolboy are Con (""short for Constantia, but if you call me that, I'll kill you""), a strong-willed schoolgirl whose primness will be tested by the rain forest adventure to come; Lila, shy and even-keeled; and finally Max, Lila's little brother, a rascal prone to tantrums. ""The Explorer"" moves at a good clip, its short scenes packed with crackling dialogue, and Rundell brings wonderful gusto to her descriptions of the many discomforts of junglelife. This is not the Amazon we think we know from films and cartoons. The piranhas and caimans the kids encounter aren't mindless killers but animals occupying important niches in the environment, and the true insect menace is not the spiders but the bullet ants. The kids come to realize the jungle is what European explorers called a ""counterfeit paradise,"" seemingly abundant but lacking food outsiders can easily recognize. There's a classic feel to this story from its very start, with its crisply characterized quartet, the kids flawed but courageous, facing exciting dangers that the reader is certain they will overcome. Even though we're in the Brazilian Amazon, everyone speaks the King's English. It's rather like the way 19th-century Europeansviewed the Amazon itself, a playground in which to work out inner selves and bring home hard-won life lessons. Rundell seems to enjoy leaning right into the nostalgia factor of her setup, as when the kids begin to suspect that they're not alone in the jungle — and that the other person out there is one of those famous long-lost English explorers. After a heyday that includes classics like Gary Paulsen's ""Hatchet"" and Jean Craighead George's ""Julie of the Wolves,"" survival stories for kids are having something of a waning moment. It's a shame, since they stoke the greatest dreams and anxieties of youth. What if there were no parents? What if I had to make my own dinner? Could I eat a grub if I had to? (Fred does, by the way, and finds it ""like eating porridge mixed with fingernail grime."") When calamity strikes, the kids must get back to civilization, and it's the mysterious adult they meet in the jungle — the lost ""explorer"" of the book's title — who helps them do so. As they consider leaving, they face big questions: Do they keep the secret of this man who wants to be left alone in the deep forest, or do they tell his story? How does Fred hold on to the love he comes to feel for the jungle, ""a trumpet call to a part of him he had not known existed,"" once he returns to civilization? Rundell navigates these concerns with humor, as when Con notes that the Amazonian macaws ""make the birds in England look like they're dressed for a job interview."" The book's verve serves as a welcome counterpoint to the lyrical descriptions of the natural environment, like the ""white thundering smoke"" of the rain. At points, Rundell's poetic fervor gets the better of the narrative, and her flights of language can feel appropriate neither to Fred's point of view nor to the book's life-or-death stakes, as when young Fred finds the jungle ""an infinite sweep of green: a Turkish carpet for a god"" or ""the stars above them were clustered so thickly that the silver outnumbered the night."" I'd rather not be arrested by Rundell's language when I could have stayed immersed in our heroic kids' jungle journey instead. With its fine balance of menace and cheer, though, ""The Explorer"" is perfectly suited to its middle-grade audience. It is a book to kindle imaginations. And though it emphasizes the fantastic otherness of the jungle in a way that feels almost antique, young readers will finish it with an impression of the grandeur of the natural world. It's a lesson we'll be learning and forgetting forever: ""When you get home, tell them how large the world is,"" the explorer says to the kids, ""and how green."""
1,2017-10-27," Good Friday morning from Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York and Michael J. de la Merced and Amie Tsang in London. We've circled Nov. 6, the date on which the House is expected to begin debating amendments on the coming tax bill. More on that in a minute. A reminder: DealBook's sixth annual conference, Playing for the Long Term, takes place on Nov. 9. Want to join us? Apply to participate here. More and more companies are asking themselves: What if Amazon comes for our business too? Potentially the biggest deal of the year, and maybe the biggest ever in the history of health insurance, is coming thanks in large part to moves by Jeff Bezos's e-commerce behemoth. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported on Thursday that Amazon had gained licenses in 12 states to become a wholesale prescription drug distributor. That seems to have prompted the drugstore giant CVS to consider buying the medical insurer Aetna, a deal that could be worth more than $60 billion. Amazon has already made a big move into brick-and-mortar retail by buying Whole Foods Market. It's making a play for the home with its Echo line of devices. And it has plenty of money to try new things: Its third-quarter revenue rose 29 percent from the same period a year ago, to $43.7 billion. ""Size- and scale-wise, they can disrupt anywhere they want to disrupt,"" Chip Davis, the head of a generic medicine trade group, said of Amazon to Bloomberg News. The strategic logic of a CVS-Aetna transaction From Andrew Ross Sorkin, Michael de la Merced and Katie Thomas, NYT: And from Dana Mattioli, Sharon Terlep and Anna Wilde Mathews, WSJ: The potential terms • CVS has offered to pay over $200 a share. Shares in Aetna rose 12 percent after the WSJ reported on the talks yesterday. • Plan on it having a big stock component, though the precise mix of cash to shares hasn't yet been decided. The reaction • Robert Cyran of Breakingviews says that the potential deal could help CVS ""resist Amazon's entry into drug distribution, and the unpleasant side effects of transparency and low margins that may follow."" (Breakingviews) • Bloomberg Gadfly's Max Nisen warns that any transaction ""could still draw regulatory scrutiny and will be difficult to pull off."" (Bloomberg Gadfly) Republicans are a step closer to being able to overhaul the tax code without Democratic support — but the House vote on a 2018 budget resolution passed by only four votes. And debate still continues on potential limits for 401(k) contributions and deductions for state and local taxes. Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said that deductions for state and local taxes were not necessarily doomed. From Jim Tankersley and Tom Kaplan, NYT: Now, keep these dates in mind ... Nov. 1: The House Ways and Means Committee will formally introduce the tax bill. Nov. 6: Debate on amendments begins. More tax points • The plan would probably include some limits on deductions for corporate debt interest payments — perhaps going from 100 percent deductibility to 70 percent deductibility — which isn't as bad as some business executives had feared. (Axios) • Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, argued that the G.O.P. tax plan doesn't track with what President Trump has promised. ""I don't think this is his tax policy,"" the senator said. (Axios) • The Republican budget resolution required no mandatory cuts, and there isn't much of an appetite to tackle spending at the moment. (Politico) Also in politics • Gary D. Cohn, the White House economic adviser, has raised the possibility of increasing federal gasoline tax to help pay for the administration's $1 trillion infrastructure plan. (Bloomberg) • The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said he would block Mr. Trump's trade policy nominees until the White House advanced a stalled effort to protect American metal producers from cheap Chinese products. (NYT) Chalk up a win to White Tale, a joint venture between the hedge fund manager Keith Meister and the investment firm 40 North, which owns a 20 percent stake in Clariant. Other shareholders later added their opposition to the $15 billion deal. White Tale's argument? The proposed merger had ""no strategic rationale and is in fact a complete reversal of the company's longstanding strategy of becoming a pure-play specialty chemicals company."" From today's joint statement by the C.E.O.s of Huntsman and of Clariant: Speaking of activists flexing their muscles • William Ackman won some support from Institutional Shareholder Services, the biggest proxy advisory firm around, in his push for change at the human-resources provider ADP. (Bloomberg) • Elliott Management's private equity arm, Evergreen Coast Capital, has struck its first public company takeover: the $1.6 billion acquisition of the network software maker Gigamon. (Gigamon) $235 billion. That's the value of divestitures — including sales, spinoffs and the winding down of joint ventures — that G.E. has announced since the departure of Jack Welch as C.E.O., according to data that Thomson Reuters analyzed for us. That makes the company a net seller of businesses, having bought $218 billion during the same period. Keep that in mind as G.E., according to the WSJ, considers selling its century-old railroad business and its health care information technology business. Since Mr. Welch turned over the reins of the industrial stalwart, the sprawling empire that he built has proved unsustainable. That's why John Flannery, G.E.'s new chief executive, told investors — after a terrible quarterly earnings report — that the company had identified up to $20 billion of assets that could be sold. • Uber's C.E.O. (and speaker at DealBook's Playing for the Long Term conference), Dara Khosrowshahi, tweeted about his trip to the kingdom. • Mohammed al-Jadaan, the Saudi Arabian finance minister, said that instead of a full international listing, Saudi Aramco could sell stakes in itself to international investors.

(CNBC) The year 2016 marked the first time that more billionaires lived in Asia (637) than in the United States (563), according to the fourth annual UBS and PwC report on billionaires. American billionaires still control more overall wealth, at $2.8 trillion, however. Their Asian counterparts owned just under $2 trillion. What's striking is that if current trends continue — particularly growth in Chinese property prices and the general increase in wealth of China's and India's middle classes — UBS and PwC say they expect Asia to outstrip the United States in overall wealth within four years. Of course, the report cautions, there's still plenty of volatility in the Asian economic outlook. • Besides Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft were other tech giants whose quarterly figures investors loved: Alphabet, Google's parent company, dramatically exceeded expectations with $6.73 billion in profit, while Microsoft beat its own expectations with $6.58 billion in net income.

2,2017-10-27," SEATTLE — With little more than a whiff of Amazon's interest in a new business, the company can crater the stocks of potential competitors, prompting them to consider bold acquisitions and other drastic measures in response. Just ask companies in the home improvement, meal-kit and grocery businesses. The latest category alarmed by the specter of competition from Amazon is the pharmacy market. With huge amounts of consumer spending and frustrating inefficiencies, it is the type of business that invariably attracts Amazon's attention. CVS Health is now in talks to acquire Aetna, one of the nation's largest health insurance providers, a move considered to be partly a reaction to the footsteps of Amazon. The likelihood of Amazon's eventually getting into the pharmacy business is high, several analysts and a former employee said. But it is not clear when it will make that move or how aggressive it intends to be. The near-term threat may be somewhat overstated. Amazon has received wholesale pharmacy licenses in at least a dozen states, as The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported on Thursday. But the licenses permit the company to sell other kinds of products too. In Connecticut, for example, the license is for ""wholesale of drugs, cosmetics and medical devices,"" while in Louisiana it was granted to a ""drug or device distributor."" Brian Tanquilut, an analyst for Jefferies, noted that the company acquired many of the wholesale pharmacy licenses between fall of last year and early this year, around when the company started selling medical supplies to businesses. ""It's not evidence of a retail entry into the pharmacy business,"" he said. An Amazon spokeswoman, Lori Torgerson, refused to comment on ""rumors or speculation"" about Amazon entering the pharmacy business, but she shared a statement that suggested other motivations for the paperwork. ""Wholesale licenses are required for Amazon Business to sell professional-use only medical devices in certain states,"" she said. There is little doubt, though, that Amazon is interested in at least some aspects of the pharmacy business. Brittain Ladd, a supply chain consultant who worked at Amazon until earlier this year on groceries and other initiatives, said he participated in discussions about how Amazon could enter the category, including through acquisitions. ""The pharmacy business was always a topic of interest when I was with Amazon, and there was a sincere desire on the part of Amazon to create a better customer experience across pharmacy and health care as a whole,"" he said. While Mr. Ladd said he isn't privy to the company's current strategy, he believes existing pharmacy companies are right to be worried. ""My advice is that executives at pharmaceutical companies should crush all assumptions when it comes to Amazon and their ability to enter, innovate and reimagine the pharmacy business and health care,"" he said. If Amazon decides to enter the market, it could take a variety of avenues, analysts said. The easiest way in would be to set up a mail-order pharmacy that focused on price-sensitive customers without health insurance or who have high-deductible plans that require them to pay for some drug costs upfront. To do this, Amazon would need retail pharmacy licenses in every state — a hurdle, certainly, but not an insurmountable one, the analysts said. ""They can at least dip their toe in the water with the cash-pay customers, and learn the business,"" said Ana Gupte, an analyst for Leerink Partners. She said cash-paying customers account for 5 percent to 10 percent of the $560 billion prescription drug business. The idea could prove attractive to customers who already go to Amazon for a wide range of shopping items, from shoes to electronics to diapers. Retailers like Target and Walmart have added pharmacies to bring in extra business for a similar reason. Amazon's recent acquisition of Whole Foods could also provide a physical location for pharmacies. ""A large part of the infrastructure is already there,"" said David Maris, an analyst for Wells Fargo. In a call with analysts this week, Timothy C. Wentworth, the chief executive of the pharmacy-benefit manager Express Scripts, indicated a willingness to work with Amazon to reach these cash-paying customers. ""We certainly see that as something where if they wanted to move into a space, we could be a very natural collaborator,"" he said. If Amazon wanted to go bigger, Ms. Gupte and others said, it could sell to insured customers and even serve as a pharmacy-benefit manager, overseeing drug coverage for people on behalf of insurers and large employers. This would be far more complex. It would likely require Amazon to either acquire a pharmacy-benefit manager or enter into a partnership with an existing one. Expanding the pharmacy business without the aid of a major pharmacy-benefit manager would be tough, because the benefit managers serve as gatekeepers to insured patients, deciding which pharmacies they can and cannot use. The benefit managers also operate their own mail-order pharmacies, which might make them less willing to accommodate Amazon. Some said they expect that if Amazon chooses to enter the health care business, it would do so in a big way. The company could attempt to provide comprehensive services to patients, doctors and others, far beyond selling drugs. Nadina J. Rosier, the health and group benefits pharmacy practice leader at Willis Towers Watson, said other areas the company could explore include offering virtual doctor consults, or using the Amazon Echo, its voice-controlled smart device, for health care applications. No matter the short-term steps Amazon is taking, Ms. Rosier said, her research has demonstrated that it is ""clearly looking to revolutionize how health care is delivered in some way."" But while Amazon has a track record for upending major industries, from books to groceries, she said health care is complicated and there would be intense pressure to get it right. ""It is just a sensitive topic,"" she said. ""We don't have as much scrutiny of how much you paid for your jeans, or your shoes."""

4,2017-10-27," Good Friday morning from Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York and Michael J. de la Merced and Amie Tsang in London. We've circled Nov. 6, the date on which the House is expected to begin debating amendments on the coming tax bill. More on that in a minute. A reminder: DealBook's sixth annual conference, Playing for the Long Term, takes place on Nov. 9. Want to join us? Apply to participate here. More and more companies are asking themselves: What if Amazon comes for our business too? Potentially the biggest deal of the year, and maybe the biggest ever in the history of health insurance, is coming thanks in large part to moves by Jeff Bezos's e-commerce behemoth. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported on Thursday that Amazon had gained licenses in 12 states to become a wholesale prescription drug distributor. That seems to have prompted the drugstore giant CVS to consider buying the medical insurer Aetna, a deal that could be worth more than $60 billion. Amazon has already made a big move into brick-and-mortar retail by buying Whole Foods Market. It's making a play for the home with its Echo line of devices. And it has plenty of money to try new things: Its third-quarter revenue rose 29 percent from the same period a year ago, to $43.7 billion. ""Size- and scale-wise, they can disrupt anywhere they want to disrupt,"" Chip Davis, the head of a generic medicine trade group, said of Amazon to Bloomberg News. The strategic logic of a CVS-Aetna transaction From Andrew Ross Sorkin, Michael de la Merced and Katie Thomas, NYT: And from Dana Mattioli, Sharon Terlep and Anna Wilde Mathews, WSJ: The potential terms • CVS has offered to pay over $200 a share. Shares in Aetna rose 12 percent after the WSJ reported on the talks yesterday. • Plan on it having a big stock component, though the precise mix of cash to shares hasn't yet been decided. The reaction • Robert Cyran of Breakingviews says that the potential deal could help CVS ""resist Amazon's entry into drug distribution, and the unpleasant side effects of transparency and low margins that may follow."" (Breakingviews) • Bloomberg Gadfly's Max Nisen warns that any transaction ""could still draw regulatory scrutiny and will be difficult to pull off."" (Bloomberg Gadfly) Republicans are a step closer to being able to overhaul the tax code without Democratic support — but the House vote on a 2018 budget resolution passed by only four votes. And debate still continues on potential limits for 401(k) contributions and deductions for state and local taxes. Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said that deductions for state and local taxes were not necessarily doomed. From Jim Tankersley and Tom Kaplan, NYT: Now, keep these dates in mind ... Nov. 1: The House Ways and Means Committee will formally introduce the tax bill. Nov. 6: Debate on amendments begins. More tax points • The plan would probably include some limits on deductions for corporate debt interest payments — perhaps going from 100 percent deductibility to 70 percent deductibility — which isn't as bad as some business executives had feared. (Axios) • Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, argued that the G.O.P. tax plan doesn't track with what President Trump has promised. ""I don't think this is his tax policy,"" the senator said. (Axios) • The Republican budget resolution required no mandatory cuts, and there isn't much of an appetite to tackle spending at the moment. (Politico) Also in politics • Gary D. Cohn, the White House economic adviser, has raised the possibility of increasing federal gasoline tax to help pay for the administration's $1 trillion infrastructure plan. (Bloomberg) • The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said he would block Mr. Trump's trade policy nominees until the White House advanced a stalled effort to protect American metal producers from cheap Chinese products. (NYT) Chalk up a win to White Tale, a joint venture between the hedge fund manager Keith Meister and the investment firm 40 North, which owns a 20 percent stake in Clariant. Other shareholders later added their opposition to the $15 billion deal. White Tale's argument? The proposed merger had ""no strategic rationale and is in fact a complete reversal of the company's longstanding strategy of becoming a pure-play specialty chemicals company."" From today's joint statement by the C.E.O.s of Huntsman and of Clariant: Speaking of activists flexing their muscles • William Ackman won some support from Institutional Shareholder Services, the biggest proxy advisory firm around, in his push for change at the human-resources provider ADP. (Bloomberg) • Elliott Management's private equity arm, Evergreen Coast Capital, has struck its first public company takeover: the $1.6 billion acquisition of the network software maker Gigamon. (Gigamon) $235 billion. That's the value of divestitures — including sales, spinoffs and the winding down of joint ventures — that G.E. has announced since the departure of Jack Welch as C.E.O., according to data that Thomson Reuters analyzed for us. That makes the company a net seller of businesses, having bought $218 billion during the same period. Keep that in mind as G.E., according to the WSJ, considers selling its century-old railroad business and its health care information technology business. Since Mr. Welch turned over the reins of the industrial stalwart, the sprawling empire that he built has proved unsustainable. That's why John Flannery, G.E.'s new chief executive, told investors — after a terrible quarterly earnings report — that the company had identified up to $20 billion of assets that could be sold. • Uber's C.E.O. (and speaker at DealBook's Playing for the Long Term conference), Dara Khosrowshahi, tweeted about his trip to the kingdom. • Mohammed al-Jadaan, the Saudi Arabian finance minister, said that instead of a full international listing, Saudi Aramco could sell stakes in itself to international investors.

(CNBC) The year 2016 marked the first time that more billionaires lived in Asia (637) than in the United States (563), according to the fourth annual UBS and PwC report on billionaires. American billionaires still control more overall wealth, at $2.8 trillion, however. Their Asian counterparts owned just under $2 trillion. What's striking is that if current trends continue — particularly growth in Chinese property prices and the general increase in wealth of China's and India's middle classes — UBS and PwC say they expect Asia to outstrip the United States in overall wealth within four years. Of course, the report cautions, there's still plenty of volatility in the Asian economic outlook. • Besides Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft were other tech giants whose quarterly figures investors loved: Alphabet, Google's parent company, dramatically exceeded expectations with $6.73 billion in profit, while Microsoft beat its own expectations with $6.58 billion in net income.

5,2017-10-27," SEATTLE — With little more than a whiff of Amazon's interest in a new business, the company can crater the stocks of potential competitors, prompting them to consider bold acquisitions and other drastic measures in response. Just ask companies in the home improvement, meal-kit and grocery businesses. The latest category alarmed by the specter of competition from Amazon is the pharmacy market. With huge amounts of consumer spending and frustrating inefficiencies, it is the type of business that invariably attracts Amazon's attention. CVS Health is now in talks to acquire Aetna, one of the nation's largest health insurance providers, a move considered to be partly a reaction to the footsteps of Amazon. The likelihood of Amazon's eventually getting into the pharmacy business is high, several analysts and a former employee said. But it is not clear when it will make that move or how aggressive it intends to be. The near-term threat may be somewhat overstated. Amazon has received wholesale pharmacy licenses in at least a dozen states, as The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported on Thursday. But the licenses permit the company to sell other kinds of products too. In Connecticut, for example, the license is for ""wholesale of drugs, cosmetics and medical devices,"" while in Louisiana it was granted to a ""drug or device distributor."" Brian Tanquilut, an analyst for Jefferies, noted that the company acquired many of the wholesale pharmacy licenses between fall of last year and early this year, around when the company started selling medical supplies to businesses. ""It's not evidence of a retail entry into the pharmacy business,"" he said. An Amazon spokeswoman, Lori Torgerson, refused to comment on ""rumors or speculation"" about Amazon entering the pharmacy business, but she shared a statement that suggested other motivations for the paperwork. ""Wholesale licenses are required for Amazon Business to sell professional-use only medical devices in certain states,"" she said. There is little doubt, though, that Amazon is interested in at least some aspects of the pharmacy business. Brittain Ladd, a supply chain consultant who worked at Amazon until earlier this year on groceries and other initiatives, said he participated in discussions about how Amazon could enter the category, including through acquisitions. ""The pharmacy business was always a topic of interest when I was with Amazon, and there was a sincere desire on the part of Amazon to create a better customer experience across pharmacy and health care as a whole,"" he said. While Mr. Ladd said he isn't privy to the company's current strategy, he believes existing pharmacy companies are right to be worried. ""My advice is that executives at pharmaceutical companies should crush all assumptions when it comes to Amazon and their ability to enter, innovate and reimagine the pharmacy business and health care,"" he said. If Amazon decides to enter the market, it could take a variety of avenues, analysts said. The easiest way in would be to set up a mail-order pharmacy that focused on price-sensitive customers without health insurance or who have high-deductible plans that require them to pay for some drug costs upfront. To do this, Amazon would need retail pharmacy licenses in every state — a hurdle, certainly, but not an insurmountable one, the analysts said. ""They can at least dip their toe in the water with the cash-pay customers, and learn the business,"" said Ana Gupte, an analyst for Leerink Partners. She said cash-paying customers account for 5 percent to 10 percent of the $560 billion prescription drug business. The idea could prove attractive to customers who already go to Amazon for a wide range of shopping items, from shoes to electronics to diapers. Retailers like Target and Walmart have added pharmacies to bring in extra business for a similar reason. Amazon's recent acquisition of Whole Foods could also provide a physical location for pharmacies. ""A large part of the infrastructure is already there,"" said David Maris, an analyst for Wells Fargo. In a call with analysts this week, Timothy C. Wentworth, the chief executive of the pharmacy-benefit manager Express Scripts, indicated a willingness to work with Amazon to reach these cash-paying customers. ""We certainly see that as something where if they wanted to move into a space, we could be a very natural collaborator,"" he said. If Amazon wanted to go bigger, Ms. Gupte and others said, it could sell to insured customers and even serve as a pharmacy-benefit manager, overseeing drug coverage for people on behalf of insurers and large employers. This would be far more complex. It would likely require Amazon to either acquire a pharmacy-benefit manager or enter into a partnership with an existing one. Expanding the pharmacy business without the aid of a major pharmacy-benefit manager would be tough, because the benefit managers serve as gatekeepers to insured patients, deciding which pharmacies they can and cannot use. The benefit managers also operate their own mail-order pharmacies, which might make them less willing to accommodate Amazon. Some said they expect that if Amazon chooses to enter the health care business, it would do so in a big way. The company could attempt to provide comprehensive services to patients, doctors and others, far beyond selling drugs. Nadina J. Rosier, the health and group benefits pharmacy practice leader at Willis Towers Watson, said other areas the company could explore include offering virtual doctor consults, or using the Amazon Echo, its voice-controlled smart device, for health care applications. No matter the short-term steps Amazon is taking, Ms. Rosier said, her research has demonstrated that it is ""clearly looking to revolutionize how health care is delivered in some way."" But while Amazon has a track record for upending major industries, from books to groceries, she said health care is complicated and there would be intense pressure to get it right. ""It is just a sensitive topic,"" she said. ""We don't have as much scrutiny of how much you paid for your jeans, or your shoes."""

7,2017-10-27," Amazon Studios declined to order another season of the feminist series ""Good Girls Revolt"" last year, just as the show's relevance was on the rise. The series, set in 1969 and '70, told the story of a fictional magazine, ""News of the Week,"" where women were harassed and barred from being reporters. In Episode 10, the women filed a lawsuit seeking equal treatment. That was the finale of the first season, and the show was not picked up for a second. That might have been the end of it — just another show, cut short at a cliffhanger, good while it lasted. But conversations about equal rights for women in the workplace have heated up in recent months as a series of prominent men — including the producer Harvey Weinstein, the director James Toback, the journalist Mark Halperin and the news anchor Bill O'Reilly — have faced multiple allegations of sexual harassment or assault from women in their respective industries. And last week Roy Price, who headed Amazon Studios when it failed to renew ""Good Girls Revolt,"" resigned from that position in the face of accusations that he had sexually harassed another show's executive producer. Now, fans of the series are wondering whether it might have survived under different leadership. Dana Calvo, the show's creator and executive producer, said in a phone interview that when she went to pitch a second season of ""Good Girls Revolt"" to Mr. Price on Nov. 30, 2016, she learned that he had never watched the first. ""He confirmed that by having us refer to the characters by the actresses' names,"" she said. ""He was unfamiliar."" Still, she was surprised to learn — the very next day — that it would not be picked up for a second season. ""It didn't line up. It was confusing. It just didn't make sense,"" she said. The series was inspired by a nonfiction book, ""The Good Girls Revolt,"" by Lynn Povich, a journalist who worked at Newsweek during the 1960s. She was one of dozens of women who filed a sex discrimination lawsuit against the newsmagazine in 1970. The actor Joy Bryant played Eleanor Holmes Norton in the series, a character named for the real-life lawyer who represented the women suing Newsweek. ""All the actors who worked on the show understood the importance of what we were doing, and how we really needed to honor the story and honor these women,"" Ms. Bryant said in a phone interview. She spent time getting to know Ms. Norton, who became the first woman to lead the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1977 and is now the District of Columbia's delegate to the United States House of Representatives. Ms. Bryant said she was ""blindsided"" when the show was not picked up for a second season, and the drama was heightened by real-world events. Season 1 began streaming on Amazon in late October, just before Donald J. Trump beat Hillary Clinton in the presidential election. ""I know we're talking about TV, but it was sort of a microcosm of what was going on,"" she said. ""We thought we had it in the bag. There's no way he's going to win. There's no way we're getting canceled."" ""That happened, and that happened, and it was like … we're really operating against some crazy forces right now,"" she said. Anna Camp, who played the strait-laced magazine researcher Jane Hollander, said she was ""shocked"" when the series was not renewed. Then she heard about Mr. Price's resignation. ""It was just so meta, or twisted, when we found out Roy Price had been accused of sexual harassment,"" she added. ""So many frustrated fans were reaching out and saying, 'Now that he's gone, maybe the show could come back.' "" Ms. Povich said the outcry reminded her that ""there is power in numbers,"" a lesson she learned at Newsweek during the 1960s and 1970s. ""It was a complicated time,"" Ms. Povich said, adding that the newsmagazine resisted hiring permanent female writers even after the 1970 complaint. A second lawsuit in 1972 laid out more concrete goals and seemed to achieve better results, including Ms. Povich's appointment to a senior editor position in 1975. Ms. Povich worked with Ms. Calvo to shape the show and said she was sorry to see it end. ""I cannot tell you how many young women I heard from who loved the series, and who also had no idea what my generation or their mothers' generation or their grandmothers' generation went through,"" she said. Ms. Calvo said the series got a warm reception from fans and good reviews on the website Rotten Tomatoes, where it has a 96 percent general audience approval rating. (The site's approved critics gave the show a rating of 71 percent.) In a review last October, The New York Times called the series ""well-timed, well-meaning, with a few smart takes,"" but added that it ""just misses the nuance and rounded characters that separate timeless fiction from the news of the week."" Amazon Studios, the company's original programming division, does not release viewership data. ""We had high hopes for Good Girls Revolt when it was green-lighted, but it had a low season completion rate, and did not perform well on the service,"" the company said in an emailed statement. A spokesman would not speculate on whether the company might consider signing on for a second season, and declined to confirm who made the decision not to renew in 2016. Ms. Povich said that in light of the harassment allegations against Mr. Price, Amazon should look at the series again ""with a much more objective point of view."" Ms. Camp agreed. ""To have our voices taken away from us so abruptly, and to have it all unfold the way it has, has been incredibly frustrating,"" she said. ""I miss Jane, and I really want to play her again."""
0,2017-10-28," I recently bought a pair of sneakers online after some browsing. I knew exactly what I was getting, having owned the same model and size before; they just weren't available in any neighborhood stores. The sneakers arrived in a few days, and I was satisfied with them. Then came the targeted ads. Over the next week I was hounded by online ads for the same sneakers I'd bought, along with others I'd rejected and many more I hadn't even seen. (Amazon also showcased items ""inspired by"" my browsing history.) I tried to ignore them, but after seeing so many ghosts of sneakers past and passed up, I began second-guessing my purchase. The same phenomenon has happened to me with much bigger expenditures. For instance, after I signed the lease on a new apartment found through a real-estate site, the site continued to email me listings that matched my specifications. The remorse is twofold: I question the merits of the thing I bought and, in hypothetical ""Sliding Doors"" fashion, am forced to consider all the roads not taken. Buyer's remorse is as old as capitalism, but online buyer's remorse is the essence of the 21st century and endlessly refreshed. As internet shopping continues to creep into our lives, most recently with the potentially unsettling arrival of Amazon Key (speaking of sliding doors), consumers may feel regret more acutely than they do with traditional retail. Those cookie-based ads and targeted emails reminding you of other possibilities reinforce the paradox of choice, the oft-cited theory of Barry Schwartz, the psychologist, that increased options leave us more dissatisfied. So, too, may more information about our choices, according to a 2008 study, ""The Blissful Ignorance Effect: Pre‐ versus Post‐Action Effects on Outcome Expectancies Arising From Precise and Vague Information,"" published in The Journal of Consumer Research. Researchers found that the less knowledge consumers had about something before a purchase, the better they expected it to be — and the more they convinced themselves that they liked it afterward. This reduction of cognitive dissonance is easier inside and after leaving a store, which never reveals anything negative about its products and doesn't typically burden the consumer with an onslaught of information that might impede an impulse purchase. But the sprawling internet bazaar is filled with scathing critiques, and every pertinent spec exists somewhere online for the diligent buyer to seek out. That one-star rating is hard to forget when your product is failing in the exact way the unhappy reviewer described. The most obvious difference between brick-and-mortar and online shopping is physicality, both of the item itself and the consumer's presence in the store. Beyond the potential pitfall of not getting exactly what you thought you were buying online, a problem that is minimized when you can assess the product in person, the lack of tactile interaction may reduce our connection to the object. Martin Lindstrom, the author of several books on branding, has conducted studies on what makes consumers buy a product and how they feel about it after. In one, 34 percent of people who asked an employee for a product in a supermarket and were made to touch it ended up buying it; just 21 percent did if the employee merely pointed it out to them. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of 20 subjects, when the senses of smell and touch were paired with pictures of a product, the right medial orbitofrontal cortex, a region of the brain involved in the perception of pleasantness, was activated more strongly than when those senses were independently engaged. (On its own, smell was the most important sense.) The tactile experience doesn't end in the checkout line. After purchasing an item, the consumer typically takes it home. This act of carrying it into one's domestic space can bolster one's proprietary pride: You are now responsible for its existence in your world. That act, plus roaming through aisles beforehand and going from shop to shop, can also be physically and mentally tiring. But ordering online for an anonymous deliveryman to leave the item at one's doorstep — or, with the help of Amazon Key, just inside — is impersonal and not enervating. It's the difference between the estrangement of ordering takeout and the intimacy of cooking for oneself. And a pavement-pounding, shop-till-you-drop marathon may recall an even more primal method for acquiring nutrients. ""You're coming back to hunters and gatherers,"" Mr. Lindstrom said of in-store purchases. ""Dopamine kicks in when we're buying stuff — there's a reptile brain that tells us we need to gather things before winter happens. The more we have to fight for things, the less likely we are to return it after. When it's delivered on Amazon Prime, you forget it was so hard to get this product."" The tactility of how one finalizes the transaction itself can have an effect on remorse, too. Mr. Lindstrom found that 93 percent of consumers feel a stronger connection to cash than to credit cards and are more careful when spending with it. Likewise, for the least tactile connection he studied, Amazon's 1-Click Ordering, 70 percent of respondents said it made them spend more money than even with a credit card. But whereas cash-based transactions lead to more immediate remorse, 89 percent of shoppers said they feel guiltier when they receive their credit card statements after 1-Click orders than when they pay in cash. The remorse still exists with online shopping; it's just deferred, with extra pain later. Shopping on a website featuring attractive models or beautiful homes may engender the same sense of inadequacy that leafing through catalogs can, unlike picking them up in person, and that visual memory may linger when the object has been delivered, leading to remorse. Buying something online can also lead quickly to a social-media search after the fact for friends' and strangers' superior products (or ""better"" use of the same product). The sneakers I bought in this troublesomely bottomless marketplace were for casual wear, but I also needed a new pair of running shoes, a purchase that I undertook with more serious online research: reading reviews from specialized publications and individual users, comparing models from different years, taking quizzes to determine what was best for my particular stride. But even the highest-rated sneakers had their detractors, and those damning, all-caps review headlines (""SHODDILY MADE,"" ""THEY RUINED IT"") made me hesitate whenever I was on the verge of adding them to my virtual shopping cart. A week after searching in vain and the ensuing deluge of targeted ads, I visited a nearby running store. I tried on a few pairs and solicited opinions from one employee, then picked the sneakers that felt best. Within 20 minutes I was walking out with them, glad to have given my money to a local business over a soulless national chain. There is undoubtedly a better running shoe out there for me, and I could probably find it if I spent enough time scouring the internet. But je ne regrette rien."

0,2017-11-01," In 2016, restless tech-industry forecasters enjoyed a rare moment of consensus: Whatever else might be coming next, everyone seemed to agree that bots would be a big part of it. The analyst Benedict Evans, in a representative essay, located a promising future specifically in chat bots — conversational interfaces for artificial intelligence, designed to assist with particular tasks. Facebook, the year before, created a personal-assistant chat bot, and the company would soon open its Messenger app up to outside developers, who it hoped would create more bots to help people shop, look things up or otherwise organize their lives. Amazon's Echo, by then already a surprise mainstream success, provided a tailwind: Here was a widely used artificial intelligence just sitting there on millions of countertops. These predictions were self-interested, of course. But they were plausible and appealing, not least because they were already coming true. By 2016, I was talking on my phone less but speaking to it more; my Echo and I had settled into a mutually beneficial, if lopsided, relationship (my commerce and privacy in exchange for the weather, some music and voice control of the fan). But despite the tech industry's efforts and hopes, the bots that have most effectively lodged themselves in the public's consciousness over the last year were not here to help — at least, not us. A different sort of bot — undercover but public-facing, highly political but comparatively primitive — was implicated in toxic and disorienting online conversations throughout the 2016 election cycle. Before the election, researchers at Oxford University suggested that between the first and second presidential debates, more than a third of pro-Trump tweets and almost a fifth of pro-Clinton tweets came from bot accounts. Political social bots have been stealing headlines ever since, described variously as ""fake Americans,"" as ""weaponized"" and as ""fake-news-disseminating"" agents of Russia. Such motive-centric descriptions tend to give too much credit to the influence bots. Mostly they are crude imitations of regular, if single-minded, people that, by virtue of existing and posting — a lot — are able to manipulate platforms' shared spaces: They increase visible follower counts and sharing metrics; they create Twitter trends and hijack or pollute hashtags into uselessness; they flood searches around breaking news. They probably don't follow you, and you probably don't follow them, but it doesn't really matter. They find their strength in numbers. They thrive just out of sight but fully within earshot. This type of bot bears little resemblance to the ones demonstrated on the stages of tech campus auditoriums. But each sort of bot is made, in its own way, to exploit untapped opportunity in large-scale automation. Where commercial bot-makers see an almost-too-good-to-be-true chance to simultaneously personify their brands and automate their businesses, political bot-makers see an opportunity to exploit anonymity with a humanlike touch at an inhuman scale. While tech companies stand proudly behind their bots, the people who create prolific and ideological social bots hide behind them. (Their provenance remains murky even today.) Anonymous social bots are obviously distinct from carefully designed software programmed in good faith. Technologically speaking, the efforts of Facebook and Google and Amazon represent the forefront of A.I. research, while crudely scripted social bots must merely clear the low bar of passing for an angry stranger. They were, in the memorable words of one researcher, ""yelling fools,"" promoting partisan messages and disinformation or merely registering their simulated agreement or anger, appearing maniacally focused, but not conclusively inhuman. A personal-assistant bot interacts with its users, whereas this breed of social-media bot stages performances for audiences and algorithms alike. But the proximity is toxic, and custody of the word is slipping. Bots, it turns out, make an excellent foil. Angela Merkel, in the run-up to this year's German federal election, talked about bots, generally, as if they were an invading army. In May, Hillary Clinton pointed to Russia-backed online efforts — including ""the bots"" — as ""just out of control."" The phrase ""not a bot"" now litters the profiles of politically engaged Twitter users (and, presumably, some bots). At the same time, President Trump, or a staff member, has indulged a habit of wandering into Twitter's uncanny valley to retweet supportive accounts whose humanity is hard to discern, or which eventually and mysteriously just disappear. Somewhere between the automated ""yelling fools"" of online political discourse and commercial tech's dream of increasingly sophisticated helpers is a third sort of social bot, which is both foolish and sophisticated in its own way. My longest and most fruitful relationship with a bot like this began through a private chat group I have with a handful of friends. We installed, as a member of the group, a free piece of software called Hubot — officially designed as a ""coding assistant"" for workplace chat apps, but which we customized mainly for work avoidance. Most often, Hubot performed menial tasks — calling up photos or animations, performing various sorts of searches — but it soon came to function as a sort of group storytelling sidekick, developing something like a personality. Hubot lurked, responded and interjected, accumulating an intimate set of routinized in-jokes. Eventually, it learned to (obliviously and dutifully) summon fresh pictures of a famous actor in the service of a joke the origins of which, after a few years, none of us could even remember. It was, like all bots, a tool. What made all the difference was that we were the ones using it, and not — as is the case with the bots that have inserted themselves into our national discourse and our living rooms — the other way around. A 2016 essay by the New York-based think tank Data & Society — a so-called botifesto — identified this playful sort of bot as an evolutionary precursor to the various expressions of bothood today. The essay described how mindfully created bots, not unlike our version of Hubot, had been functioning in the wild, on public social media. Some were jokes and larks, whose ""very 'botness' is funny, surreal or poetic"": bots that used a social-media personality's corpus to create a (usually funny, always revealing) surrogate account, or bots that automated the dispersal of information in controlled, open and even journalistic ways. But the botifesto's intention was to sound an alarm. Less transparent social bots — primarily on Twitter and other social platforms — posed a risk to media and discourse. ""Platforms, governments and citizens must step in and consider the purpose — and future — of bot technology before manipulative anonymity becomes a hallmark of the social bot,"" the authors cautioned. This warning wasn't just a prediction; it was based in observation. Anonymous bots masquerading as citizen and political actors had been a creeping feature in foreign elections for years. The 2012 election of President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico was supported by armies of automated social-media accounts, which flooded Twitter with supportive messages. ""Peñabots"" became a feature of online Mexican political discourse through at least 2015. But bots hadn't yet run rampant on American tech companies' home turf. Manipulation by A.I. was typically seen as ""something that was happening somewhere else,"" M.C. Elish, a researcher at Data & Society who contributed to the report, told me. ""We only notice something when it's arrived on our doorstep."" This arrival is likely to result in action. Twitter, for example, insists that it has been working hard on the problem. One of the most frequently proposed solutions to the problem of ""manipulative anonymity"" among researchers in the field is some form of bot disclosure — a requirement, enforced by social platforms, that an account operated by third-party software disclose that fact. (Wikipedia, for example, already does this.) Bot disclosure could plausibly stem the tide of bots intended to exert crude influence or to harass people. Humans would, in theory, be able to interact with bots electively, and to better judge some sources of information or expressions of sentiment. A grand sorting could begin to restore order, but Twitter's discourse nightmare didn't start with bots and won't end with them. Social automation is both disruptive and revealing. Twitter in particular dehumanizes users in the process of giving them access to one another, so of course bots could thrive there — and of course they'd closely resemble our worst-tweeting selves. Voice-and-text-activated assistants help monopolistic companies further consolidate power, and they complicate the stories we tell ourselves about privacy, as we invite the eyes and ears of the world's most ambitious tech businesses into our most personal spaces. Alexa reminds us what Amazon wants; Twitter bots show us how online mass communication breaks down. What was truly great about Hubot, the cobbled-together, inscrutable, mostly useless chat automaton, was the suggestion it made, through each absurd routine: that online, it's necessary that we build spaces for ourselves."
1,2017-11-01," The tech giants are too big. But what if that's not so bad? For a year and a half — and more urgently for much of the last month — I have warned of the growing economic, social and political power held by the five largest American tech companies: Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft. Because these companies control the world's most important tech platforms, from smartphones to app stores to the map of our social relationships, their power is growing closer to that of governments than of mere corporations. That was on stark display this week, when executives from two of the five, Facebook and Google, along with a struggling second-tier company, Twitter, testified before Congress about how their technology may have been used to influence the 2016 election. Yet ever since I started writing about what I call the Frightful Five, some have said my very premise is off base. I have argued that the companies' size and influence pose a danger. But another argument suggests the opposite — that it's better to be ruled by a handful of responsive companies capable of bowing to political and legal pressure. In other words, wouldn't you rather deal with five horse-size Zucks than 100 duck-size technoforces? The insatiable appetite of digital technology to alter everything in its path is among the most powerful forces shaping the world today. Given all the ways that tech can go wrong — as we are seeing in the Russia influence scandal — isn't it better that we can blame, and demand fixes from, a handful of American executives when things do go haywire? That's not ridiculous. Over the last few weeks, several scholars said there are good reasons to be sanguine about our new tech overlords. Below, I compiled their best arguments about the bright side of the Five. Tech is inherently messy. The greatest human inventions tend to change society in ways that are more profound than anyone ever guesses, including the people who created them. This has clearly been true for the technologies we use today, and will be even more true for the stuff we will get tomorrow. The internet, mobile phones, social networks and artificial intelligence will make a mess of the status quo — and it will be our job, as a society, to decide how to mitigate their downsides. One benefit of having five giant companies in charge of today's tech infrastructure is that they provide a convenient focus for addressing those problems. Consider Russian propaganda. People have worried about the internet's capacity to foster echo chambers and conspiracy theories almost since it began; in fact, in several cases over the last two decades — from 9/11 to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth to birtherism — the internet did play a key role in the propagation of misinformation. But because those rumors and half-truths spread in a digital media landscape that was not owned and operated by giant companies — one in which information was passed along through a Wild West of email, discussion boards and blogs — it was never conceivable to limit that era's equivalent of fake news. Today, it suddenly is. Because Facebook, Google and Twitter play such a central role in modern communication, they can be hauled before Congress and either regulated or shamed into addressing the problems unleashed by the technology they control. This does not mean they will succeed in fixing every problem their tech creates — and in some cases their fixes may well raise other problems, like questions about their power over freedom of expression. But at least they can try to address the wide variety of externalities posed by tech, which may have been impossible for an internet more fragmented by smaller firms. ""This is new stuff everybody is dealing with — it's not easy,"" said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank, and co-author of ""Big Is Beautiful,"" a coming book that extols the social and economic virtues of big companies. (The foundation is funded, in part, by donations from tech companies.) ""So when you discover a problem, scale makes that easier. You've got one or two big firms, and they have a lot of public pressure to be a responsible actor."" Over the last few weeks, many people at large tech companies have repeatedly responded to my questions about the dangers posed by big tech with a funny argument: Yes, they would say, the other tech giants really are worrisome — so why was I including their company in that group? It was an odd line. As an outsider to these companies, I tend to worry about the collective power of the Five, especially the way they have managed to control the fortunes of innovative start-ups. But none of the Five see themselves as part of a group — each of them worries about the threat posed by start-ups and by the other four giants, which means that none feels it has the luxury to slow down in creating the best new stuff. This dynamic — where each company competes mightily against the others — suggests some reason for optimism, said Michael Lind, who wrote ""Big Is Beautiful"" with Mr. Atkinson. ""As long as their innovation rents are recycled into research and development that leads to new products, then what's to complain about?"" You can see this in their product road maps. None of the Five has slowed down investing intended to further expand its area of control — for instance, Google keeps investing in search, Facebook is still spending heavily to create new social-networking features, and Amazon remains relentless in creating new ways to let people shop. At the same time, they are all locked in intense battles for new markets and technologies. And not only do they keep creating new tech, but they are coming at it in diverse ways — with different business models, different philosophies and different sets of ethics. ""So, why pre-emptively say that maybe we'll be harmed in the future — that in 2030 they'll jack up their prices or something?"" Mr. Lind asked. ""Well, deal with that as it comes."" The Five achieved their dominance because they operate in areas that provide massive returns to scale. Thanks to economic dynamics like network effects — where a product, like Facebook, gets more useful as more people use it — it was perhaps inevitable that we would see the rise of a handful of large companies take control of much of the modern tech business. But it wasn't inevitable that these companies would be based in and controlled from the United States. And it's not obvious that will remain the case — the top tech companies of tomorrow might easily be Chinese, or Indian or Russian or European. But for now, that means we are dealing with companies that feel constrained by American laws and values. Yes, this is jingoistic; the idea of a handful of American tech giants controlling much of society has helped push regulators internationally to try to limit their power. But we would almost certainly do the same if a bunch of foreign companies attempted to take over our economy. At least it's our own giants that we have to fear. I don't mean this list to get the Five off the hook. How we deal with their efforts to capture more power over the economy and our society is perhaps the next great question facing America. But this is a complex problem precisely because there are both advantages and disadvantages to their size. As I said, tech is messy."
0,2017-11-02," THE SEQUOIA DRESS from the New York-based independent fashion label Creatures of Comfort is not the kind of garment one might refer to as ""sexy."" Dun-colored, ankle-lengthed, high-necked and voluminous-sleeved, this seemingly innocuous $450 number became an unlikely lightning rod this summer, when the writer and editor Doree Shafrir shared a screenshot of it on Twitter, writing: ""Bless everyone who is pretty enough, skinny enough and rich enough to wear this dress."" This rapidly summoned a number of droll, liked-in-the-thousands responses from other women. ""Adding this to my Amazon Amishlist,"" one wrote; ""It's a party dress! A Donner party dress,"" another tweeted; ""The sister wives and I all decided to go with turd brown,"" added a third. Considering our current moment's heart-poundingly swift, frequently terrifying news cycle, the Sequoia affair hardly made for the most momentous or enduring story. And yet it touched on a puzzling phenomenon: the significant turn in fashion over the past couple of years toward almost aggressively non-provocative dressing, and the complicated feelings women have about it. To judge from Shafrir's tweet — and those that came after it — many women would appear to be skeptical of the current vogue for conservative, covered-up fashions. Only those blessed with the privileges money and slim good looks bring, these women seemed to suggest, could get away with wearing a dress that evokes virginal drabness at best and cult-style patriarchal oppression at worst; a dress which, with its sacklike silhouette, looks like a cross between a 1880s homesteading smock and the so-called bankruptcy barrel archetypically worn by old-timey hobos. And still, the look persists, even thrives. This past spring, The New York Times's chief fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, declared modest fashion a defining trend of the 2010s, with brands as varied as Céline, with its enveloping, cocoon-like garments, Erdem, with its long-sleeved, high-collared Victoriana dresses, and Vetements, with its almost comically outsize getups, all promoting the look. As Friedman argued, in a vulnerable, volatile time — perhaps one particularly so for women — figure-obscuring clothing serves as a kind of armor, as well as a retort to a reality-TV-inured culture apparently intent on exposing any private moment, any intimate body part, for public consumption. Once we've seen it all — from Emily Ratajkowski's fabulous breasts to Kim Kardashian's monumental butt — it now seems as if the most radical gesture could only involve donning a baggy jumpsuit or a generously cut midi-skirt. This is a look not seen only on the runways. It's there in the television adaptation of Margaret Atwood's dystopian but all-too-timely ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" where the long red gowns and severe white bonnets worn by the show's subjugated women serve as visual markers of oppression, while also managing to appear suddenly, disconcertingly fashion. (Indeed, the young American label Vaquera produced a special collection early this summer, inspired by the show's costumes, which Katy Perry called ""very retro pilgrim"" in her MTV Video Music Awards opening monologue this August.) It's in the recent movie ""Ingrid Goes West,"" where the height of contemporary California style is embodied by Instagram influencer Taylor Sloane (played by Elizabeth Olsen), with her figure-blurring linen shifts and long, rich-hippie skirts; it's in many of Solange's recent outfits (the Thom Browne puffer coat the singer wore to the 2017 Met gala, or the long-sleeved turtleneck and high-waisted pleated pants she performed in at Glastonbury this year); and it's in the prairie-chic togs found in any collection from, say, Rachel Comey (the independent New York label whose patrons, as a fashion-forward friend of mine tweeted recently, could very easily be mistaken for worshipers emerging from a ""cool church""). Modest fashion might come across as a humblebrag: You have to be a pretty stylish, pretty good-looking woman to claim ownership of such radical dowdiness. (The style seems especially popular among women in their 20s and 30s — trumping the received wisdom that one should flaunt one's body before it is marked by the supposed scourges of childbearing or menopause.) It can also sometimes seem like an elitist project of sociocultural self-positioning: By embracing the covered-up look, you declare yourself part of a particular psychographic tribe, one whose members don't just dress for other women, but for a particular subset of other women — those who get it, who are sophisticated enough to understand that opting out of conventional beauty standards makes for its own kind of conceptual, better-than-thou fashion. It also, however, has the feel of a real dare. Observing this version of feminist signaling, which conflates the rebel, haphazard spirit of a Bloomsbury Group-like smockishness with traces of early '90s grunge and a dash of post-bellum Sunday best, we might begin to ask ourselves: What happens when women start dressing in ways that are less than conventionally flattering? Why are they doing it? And what does it look like when fashion choices that might have been linked to female oppression perform in the service of liberation? HISTORICALLY, CONSERVATIVE dressing is most frequently associated with religious adherence, which makes the most recent, trendier iteration of the phenomenon especially surprising — considering the kind of woman who is newly sheathing herself in long, baggy silhouettes is often the type of liberal nonbeliever who'd be the first to eschew any traditional strictures on her choices, sartorial or otherwise. Orthodox Jews follow the laws of tzniut (literally ""modesty"" in Hebrew), according to which the body of a woman — and her hair, too, if she's married — should be substantively covered; observant Muslim women often wear a version of the hijab and loose-fitting, figure-obscuring clothing in public settings; and women in traditional Christian communities, from Amish to Mennonite, wear long dresses and, sometimes, some form of head covering. But whether one believes it's a marker of outdated patriarchal coercion or a choice to be made by the devout woman herself, what seems clear is that this kind of dressing has until recently been seen as miles away from what a modern secular woman would want to wear. This contradiction might be best embodied in the story of the lifestyle magazine Kinfolk — a publication that led the charge in advancing the kind of woodsy-hipster design-and-fashion aesthetic that has grown popular in America's most liberal enclaves, from Silver Lake to Fort Greene, but that also has its roots in the Mormon upbringing of its founders, who established it in 2011 while attending Brigham Young University-Hawaii. The humble, homespun spirit usually associated with retiring, self-enclosed communities of believers has been imported, not unlike the covered-up dressing trend, to an arena that feels largely alien to it, but that embraces its tenets — the handcrafted, the natural, the rustic — at least inasmuch as they can be marketed as a kind of soothing artisanal salve to the alienations of late-capitalist life. SPEAKING TO some nonreligious women who tend to dress modestly, however, goes a way toward clarifying the style's utility and function, as well as some of its inherent ambiguities. Thirty-two-year-old Hannah Hoffman, who runs her own eponymous gallery in Los Angeles, says she prefers figure-enshrouding outfits, mostly from Céline, to any other look. This is a matter of being both mobile and versatile — with her low heels and wide-cut pants, Hoffman told me, she can always jump up to grab an artwork or walk clients through her space — but the roots of her choices go deeper. ""Everyone who's involved on the commercial side of the art world is transacting on desire, for an object but also for an experience,"" she said. ""So you have to walk a very particular line in order to not dilute it, or misrepresent it, so people won't get confused about what you're selling them."" As a young woman helming her own business, this is a line that Hoffman feels she has to be careful not to cross, and she told me that rather than a more conventionally feminine aura, she prefers to project a ""rigor and intellectual thoughtfulness"" with her clothing choices. Commenting on the body-conscious silhouette prevalent among assistant-level gallery girls when she was starting in the art world in the mid-2000s, Hoffman noted how the power of a certain breed of male gallery owner had often seemed to her to be transacted through exactly such specters of young female sexuality, ""and that's not something you want to do."" Still, sometimes she wonders why she is the one who has to police the boundaries of appropriateness: Why is it, she said, that ""if you wear a short skirt and a collector hits on you, it's your fault?"" There is something dispiriting (though perhaps not surprising, considering, for one, who America elected for president) about the ongoing need to consider such questions — after at least three waves of feminism have asserted a woman's right to self-determination over her own body, and, by extension, her clothing choices. Haven't we realized by now that women not only shouldn't be held responsible for men's misreading of their cues, but that, moreover, they might come to see their bodies and sexuality as a source of power to be reveled in rather than guarded? (Certainly, another recent leaning in fashion — that toward body positivity and acceptance — has been championing exposing rather than obscuring bodies of all sizes.) Still, Hoffman's perspective is familiar and understandable: Being a woman, one needs to frequently assess others' expectations over and against one's own. As the 21-year-old actress, writer and editor Tavi Gevinson told me, the relative modesty — or lack thereof — of her clothing choices reflects more than her own individual preferences. If she's going on an audition, she won't dress in what she called ""a frumpy art teacher look"" (a look, as she joked during our conversation, that could also be called ""Brooklyn mom"" or ""European baby""). Rather, ""I would dress in something that makes my figure look nice, because people are stupid, and most of the time when they say, 'We want her to come in again,' what they really mean is 'Wear something more conventionally attractive.' "" In the publishing world, however, when Gevinson wants to be taken more seriously, as a thinker rather than a body, a dowdier look is helpful, so she can seem, she said, ""as if I've somehow matured past a quote unquote juvenile desire to be perceived as a woman."" The formula, then, is flipped, but not in a way that's necessarily more freeing. THE STATE OF wanting to be looked at is often mingled with self-consciousness about that very desire. I've always thought that one of the reasons the ""Little House on the Prairie"" books continue to be popular with tween girls, many decades after they were first published, is that their presentation of the difficulties inherent to a girl's maturation into womanhood are mediated through the cushioning presence of yards of calico, wool and muslin. As a 10-year-old, excited but terrified at the prospect of my own encroaching puberty, reading the passages in ""Little Town on the Prairie"" (1941) detailing, say, Mary Ingalls's going-away-to-college outfit, with its ""gored skirt of brown cashmere,"" and ""overskirt ... of brown-and-blue plaid"" not to mention its confusingly named ""flounced train"" and ""pleated flounce"" (were those one and the same?) acted as a balm, a calming litany; covered-up fashion, it seemed, could protect you from the grenade that your body was slowly but surely becoming. Keeping this potential explosiveness to oneself, however, could also be understood as a sign of strength. As 32-year-old Aminatou Sow, a digital strategist and the co-host of the popular podcast ""Call Your Girlfriend,"" told me, ""if you let women dress for themselves, we'd all be wearing muumuus and caftans."" Sow, who grew up Muslim in Guinea and Nigeria before moving to Europe and then the States, cited the comfort factor of these silhouettes (""anything that looks like a sack is my jam""), but also the sense of inner confidence that they foster, one that she first recognized in the women she grew up among in West Africa. ""It's part of my cultural heritage. ... I don't need to show my shoulders, I don't need to show my back. I know what I'm carrying underneath this thing,"" she said. ""I really disagree with women who think walking around naked is liberation. I'm like, 'I'm sorry, too many people get to enjoy this for it to be liberation,' "" she added, only half in jest. Instead, she cites figures like Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who, first as actresses and street-style sensations and later as designers of the Row, made dressing in long, hobo-ish layers chic. ""It was really jarring, and men didn't like it,"" Sow recalled to me. ""But there was something disgusting and liberating about it. These were girls who didn't care how anyone else was supposed to be dressing. It was the rejection of body politics."" Navigating the world in a woman's body remains a fraught proposition in the most quotidian and granular of ways. And a woman with her body de-emphasized, with her conventional calling card scrapped — what a puzzle she is! I recall a couple of years ago walking in downtown Manhattan and spotting the writer Sheila Heti across the street. It was late fall, and as far as I can recall, Heti, whom I've never met, was wearing a knee-length nubby coat over a long skirt and some practical lace-up shoes, all in varying shades of gray and brown. In all the more typical ways, she was looking maybe a little drab, maybe a little dowdy. And yet, there was something about her air that was enviable. There she was, walking along, her hair in a ponytail, carrying a book and swinging it at her side, as if without a care in the world. She seemed completely at home — and completely herself — in her essentially concealed body."
1,2017-11-02," The truth turns into a tangled mess in ""A River Below,"" a bold and urgent documentary whose seemingly straightforward story quickly runs awry. Filmed primarily on and around the Amazon River, the movie centers on the pink river dolphin and two men trying to save the species from extinction. The dolphin is amazingly approachable and curious, yet its flesh is also the prime bait for piracatinga, a catch that many fishermen sell for their livelihood. In recent years, thousands of dolphins have been slaughtered. Fernando Trujillo, a Colombian scientist, has toiled to protect dolphins and alert authorities to high levels of mercury in piracatinga. Eventually he brings his facts to the media, and receives threats from those who disdain his work. ""What kind of world is this when a biologist needs to be scared to tell the truth?"" he asks. By the end of the film he's donning a bulletproof vest. The second man, Richard Rasmussen, is a Steve Irwin-like host of a nature show in Brazil. He was instrumental in bringing a horrific video to light, one where fishermen spear then butcher a pregnant dolphin. The footage, played here several times, sparked outrage and led to a five-year ban on piracatinga fishing. Soon there are disputes over the video's accuracy and how it was obtained, as well as fights over the collateral damage that arose from its airing. Accusations of media manipulation are made, as are arguments over whether the video's ends justified the means. Even while delivering magnificent views of the Amazon, Mark Grieco, the director, doesn't shy away from harsh images. He also captures taut moments as this conservation film becomes an examination of ethics and aftereffects, and as simple facts turn frustratingly complex."
0,2017-11-06," CVS Health said on Monday that it would begin offering next-day delivery of prescription drugs and same-day service in some big cities next year, reflecting the company's worries about potential competition from Amazon. CVS Health also said its retail sales declined in the third quarter of this year, a dip that the company said occurred because of the three major hurricanes that forced many stores to close. Amazon's possible expansion into prescription drugs has set the pharmacy industry on edge in recent months, igniting fears that the online behemoth will upend the existing business in much the same way that it has disrupted other consumer markets, from books to household supplies to groceries. Amazon has not publicly announced its plans. But it has acquired several state-level permits to be a wholesale pharmacy distributor over the past year and recently hired a handful of executives from the drug industry. Anxiety over such a market upheaval is said to have partly driven CVS to enter into talks with Aetna, the large health insurer, over a potential acquisition. Larry Merlo, the president and chief executive of CVS Health, did not discuss the potential deal in a call with analysts on Monday. Free delivery will be available ""within hours"" for prescription drug orders, as well as a ""curated selection of over-the-counter products"" in Manhattan beginning Dec. 4, the company said. Same-day delivery would expand to Miami, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco early next year. Next-day delivery, from local stores, would become available in the rest of the country. A CVS spokeswoman, Erin Pensa, said delivery fees outside of Manhattan will vary by location, and have not yet been made public. She also said the company's delivery partner has not been announced, but ""we've been able to use our scale to negotiate low-cost, affordable options for all CVS Pharmacy customers."" ""Our goal is to meet the needs of all of our customers wherever, however and whenever they want,"" Helena Foulkes, executive vice president of CVS Health and president of CVS Pharmacy, said in a statement Monday. CVS said Monday that retail sales, which include prescription sales, fell 2.7 percent in the third quarter, although that was offset by the performance of its pharmacy services business, which manages drug benefits for employers and insurers. That unit saw revenues increase by 8.1 percent. Overall, third-quarter revenues increased by 3.5 percent, or $1.6 billion, to $46.2 billion, compared to the third quarter of 2016."

1,2017-11-11," Singles Day — the frenzied annual celebration of consumption and commerce that is China's much larger version of Black Friday — began as a protest of sorts against Valentine's Day, propelled by college students in the 1990s. The event's date, written numerically as 11/11, was associated with unattached singles, known as ""bare sticks."" This year's shopping festival entered new territory, blazing past $1 billion within two minutes of the holiday, starting at midnight on Saturday. By the end of the day, sales had hit a new record of $25.3 billion, more than 40 percent higher than sales on Singles Day 2016. Singles Day is now inextricably linked with Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce leviathan that in recent years has turned the holiday into an online — and occasionally brick-and-mortar — mercantile extravaganza. It routinely eclipses Amazon's yearly Prime Day promotional event. In July, Prime Day generated an estimated $1 billion in revenue during its 30-hour sale window, resulting in what Amazon called its ""biggest day ever."" The event has evolved into a cultural phenomenon. On Friday night, Alibaba hosted a lavish gala in Shanghai, directed by one of the producers behind the 2016 Academy Awards. Celebrities such as Nicole Kidman, Pharrell Williams and Maria Sharapova helped count down the moments before the 60,000 participating global brands released their Singles Day deals to shoppers. One offer, from the Chongqing-based online alcohol brand Jiang Xiao Bai, allowed 33 fast-moving customers to make a single payment of 11,111 yuan, or $1,673, for a lifetime supply of a grain liquor known as baijiu. Singles Day, which is largely powered through Alibaba's Tmall marketplace, was a test of the company's logistics network. The company promised delivery within an hour for certain products and, in advance of the shopping festival, converted nearly 100,000 stores across China into ""smart stores"" capable of processing payment using facial recognition and other advanced technologies."
0,2017-11-13," Middle Earth is coming to TV. Amazon announced on Monday that it has retained the rights to adapt J.R.R. Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings"" for television for its Prime streaming service. The multi-season adaptation will feature ""new story lines preceding J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Fellowship of the Ring,'"" which is the first ""Rings"" book, Amazon said in a statement. The deal also includes the opportunity to pursue spinoff series. But it will cost Amazon dearly: Deadline reported that  just the rights to the globally popular franchise cost $200 million. Further details — such as what writers, producers or actors would be involved, or when the show might debut — have not been announced. With its fantastical setting and characters, ""The Lord of the Rings"" bears a superficial resemblance to HBO's ""Game of Thrones,"" currently one of the biggest shows in the world. (George R.R. Martin, who wrote the books that series was based on, has said Tolkien's series was an inspiration.) It is also a proven pop culture commodity. Collectively the three ""Lord of the Rings"" films directed by Peter Jackson grossed more than $2.9 billion internationally. The TV adaptation will cover different ground, focusing on ""previously unexplored stories based on J.R.R. Tolkien's original writings,"" Matt Galsor, a representative for the Tolkien Estate and Trust and HarperCollins, said in a statement. The move amounts to a much-needed shot in the arm for Amazon, which has lost several top leaders in the wake of a sexual harassment allegation. Last month, Roy Price, the head of Amazon's entertainment streaming efforts, was forced to resign after a producer said he made an unwanted advance. Mr. Price's top lieutenant, Joe Lewis, left Amazon shortly thereafter. Amazon said it will produce the series along with Tolkien Estate and Trust, the book publisher HarperCollins and the film studio New Line Cinema. The move also comes just four months after the Tolkien estate and Warner Bros. — the parent company of New Line Cinema — settled an $80 million lawsuit."
0,2017-11-15," SEATTLE — Amazon and the tax man are back at it again. For years, the company and state governments scuffled over Amazon's resistance to charging state sales tax, which helped keep prices low on its e-commerce site and angered politicians and other retailers. Eventually, Amazon began adding the tax in states across the country. But there was a loophole. Amazon added the tax only when the item came from its own inventory, not from the millions of independent merchants who sell products through Amazon's website. Amazon left it up to those sellers — who account for half of all items sold on the site — to collect sales tax on their own. But, according to sellers, tax lawyers and accountants who work with them, most do not. Now states, thirsty for the millions of dollars in unpaid sales taxes revenue, are coming for their money. Amazon recently warned its sellers that the company, as of Jan. 1, would be collecting sales tax from merchants who ship orders to its home state, Washington, as it seeks to comply with a state law signed in July. That will be the first time Amazon has collected a state sales tax for the merchants known as marketplace sellers on its site. It is a grudging concession by the online retail giant. In South Carolina, the company is fighting an effort by the state's Department of Revenue to use existing laws to force Amazon to collect tax on marketplace sales. The state is arguing that Amazon owes it $57 million in such taxes from last year. A judge's decision in the case is pending. Other states are going after Amazon's sellers, a much less powerful target, for unpaid sales taxes. In Massachusetts, a judge in late September ordered Amazon to give the state information about merchants who stored goods in the state. Sellers have reported receiving letters from tax investigators in California, too. Consumers may absorb much of the new costs. Depending on the state, sales tax can add 5 percent to nearly 10 percent to the cost of an order. Jill Kerr, a spokeswoman for Amazon, declined to comment. In a recent filing with regulators, Amazon singled out South Carolina's effort as a risk. ""If South Carolina or other states were successfully to seek additional adjustments of a similar nature, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities,"" Amazon said in the filing. ""We intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter."" Taxes remain a political sore spot for Amazon, even as it has become one of the most successful companies in the world. President Trump has even taken to criticizing the business on Twitter as a ""no-tax monopoly,"" attacks that often appear prompted by coverage of him in The Washington Post, which is personally owned by Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive. Amazon pays hundreds of millions of dollars annually in income taxes and charges tax on the sale of its own goods in every state that has a sales tax. But because so many marketplace sellers do not collect sales tax, there is some legitimacy to the idea that Amazon is not doing everything it can to make sure the government gets its cut. Caught in the middle are Amazon's marketplace sellers, who run the gamut from small mom-and-pop operations to more sophisticated merchants boasting teams of employees. On Amazon's marketplace, sellers list their products for sale and determine the price. Many take advantage of an additional program, called Fulfillment by Amazon, through which their inventory is stored in Amazon's warehouses and shipped by the company. The sellers pay Amazon fees for those services, but the e-commerce giant leaves it up to them to collect sales tax where they are required to do so. The fees Amazon charges its marketplace sellers are a huge business for the company, totaling nearly $8 billion during its most recent quarter, up from $5.65 billion a year earlier. Many of the merchants said they have received conflicting advice on their sales tax obligations from accountants and lawyers, according to interviews with several individual merchants and consultants who work with dozens of sellers each. Few want to charge sales tax without assurances that competing merchants on Amazon will do the same. ""There's a lot of anxiety,"" said Chris McCabe, who previously worked at Amazon and now provides consulting services to merchants. ""There's a lot of ambiguity here."" Many Amazon sellers, Mr. McCabe said, live in fear of getting a letter or phone call from a state investigator that leads to a hefty bill for uncollected back sales taxes, which could also come with penalties and interest. The sellers interviewed for this article would speak only on the condition of anonymity, saying they feared attracting the notice of such an investigator. Sales taxes on e-commerce are governed by a 1992 Supreme Court decision, Quill Corporation v. North Dakota, which established that states cannot collect taxes from companies that did not have a physical presence there. In its early days, Amazon took advantage of that law by keeping its warehouses out of populous states like California. But as the company has grown and focused more on reducing delivery times, it reached deals with many states to set up warehouses inside their borders. As part of those agreements, Amazon typically agreed to begin charging sales taxes after a delay of a few years. Sellers who sign up for Fulfillment by Amazon are probably the most exposed to the state income tax laws. As part of the program, their merchandise gets distributed to numerous Amazon warehouses. Most states take the position that having their inventory in a warehouse, even if the facility belongs to Amazon, creates a duty to charge sales tax on marketplace sales in those states. Not all advisers agree. One electronics seller, who has millions of dollars in annual sales on Amazon, said he only collected sales taxes for orders delivered in his state, on the advice of his accountant. Accountants are not in agreement on the issue either. Michael Fleming, an accountant of Peisner Johnson in Texas, said his firm's business was booming with Amazon marketplace sellers. He advises them, he said, to charge sales tax wherever a state can argue it has a ""nexus"" — the term most used for a physical presence. He said he believed the reason Amazon has been reluctant to step in and charge sales tax on marketplace orders is that it could assume a large additional liability for any mistakes the sellers make. ""Maybe the seller mislabels something, and tax that should be collected isn't,"" Mr. Fleming said. ""Then Amazon gets audited. Amazon is paying tax out of their pocket when it's really a mistake by an individual seller."" Mr. Fleming said he has heard from clients that the states of Washington and California have been particularly aggressive in going after them for back taxes on Amazon marketplace sales. But it could be that the states are simply focusing on a fast-growing part of retail. ""Given the volume of businesses that make retail sales through Amazon's marketplace platform, it is likely that some of these businesses may have been contacted through the normal course of our tax discovery efforts,"" said Beverly Crichfield, a spokeswoman for Washington's Department of Revenue. With concerns mounting among sellers, the Multistate Tax Commission, an intergovernmental state tax agency, recently offered an amnesty program that frees marketplace sellers from back tax liabilities when they take steps to collect them on current sales. But some states, including New York, California and Washington, did not participate in the program. Only 852 sellers out of the hundreds of thousands estimated to be selling on Amazon applied for the program. Paul Rafelson, an adjunct professor at Pace University's law school and a lawyer who works with Amazon sellers, said he believed that some states were going after sellers for back taxes to avoid a face-off with the company. He said the scramble by states and cities to woo Amazon as it seeks a place for its second headquarters — bidding has set off a huge competition — has made state governments even less inclined to go after Amazon. ""A lot of states,"" he said, ""have told me it's too political to go after Amazon."""

1,2017-11-16," SEATTLE — Amazon, the colossus of internet commerce that was founded here, is conducting the most dramatic sweepstakes of modern capitalism in throwing open a competition for a coequal second headquarters. The company has promised to create about 50,000 new jobs at HQ2, as Amazon is calling it, paralleling the similar number the company plans to employ here over the next couple of years. Six-figure salaries, real-estate investments and economic ripple effects — from health care for all those new workers to the hash browns being served for breakfast — could inject $50 billion or more into the winning town, economists say. Proposals from 43 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, as well as Canada and Mexico, are now being considered, with a decision scheduled for sometime next year. For Seattle, Amazon has become far more than a big employer and taxpayer. It reshaped how the city sees itself and, in turn, is seen by the world. It created a vast, gleaming new campus in a once derelict corner of the city, but also raised deep concerns about housing costs, traffic congestion and potential over-dependence on one corporation. In interviews with experts and residents, from tech company offices to chambers of commerce, here are the lessons from Seattle for all those cities now seeking the Amazon prize. The second Amazon headquarters will unquestionably have a major impact on whichever city gets the nod. But Amazon did not start from scratch. A maritime, export-based economy that has long looked more toward Asia and Alaska than to the rest of America was already here when Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder, arrived in 1994 and began selling books from his garage. So was a history of art and music that runs from Quincy Jones through Nirvana and Pearl Jam, part of the mystique that has drawn young people for generations. Seattle's percentage of millennial-age people, 25 to 34, is near the highest in the nation among big cities, according to 2015 estimates by the census. A collective corporate cultural ethos had been built as well by other companies that arose from a city of working waterfronts and gloomy skies. REI, Eddie Bauer, Starbucks, Nordstrom and Costco — not to mention Microsoft and Boeing — shaped the economic rootstock that Amazon grew from, and created an assumption by many Seattle residents that corporations should be involved in the community as civic leaders. ""There isn't an obvious candidate where they're going to get the same confluence of features,"" said Fred H. Smith, a professor of urban economic history at Davidson College in North Carolina, who has evaluated the bid by his state's leading HQ2 contender, Charlotte. Seattle hit a sweet spot with the company's rise, Professor Smith said, as Amazon tapped into an existing rich pool of talent and resources, from the University of Washington's strengths in computer science, to cheap electricity from the Pacific Northwest's connections to hydropower dams in the Columbia River basin. ""Finding a city that has all of those things is a tough goal,"" he said. A company that started out selling books became one of the inventors of cloud computing as a business, selling not just goods but the invisible machinery of internet commerce itself. It has leapt into the grocery business with the recent acquisition of Whole Foods. It made a decision that employees could bring their dogs to work, and on any given day, about 1,200 pets are roaming the 33 buildings of the urban campus in the South Lake Union area. The message to HQ2 cities is clear: What you get now will probably not be what Amazon becomes. Change and churn have become part of the Amazon brand, and thus the Seattle brand, business people said. In the past seven years, coinciding with Amazon's biggest growth spurt, the number of Fortune 500 companies with an office in Seattle quadrupled, to 31 from seven, many of them hunkering down as closely as they can to Amazon. ""There's an ecosystem that has been really enhanced because of Amazon,"" said Josh Simms, the chief executive of H5 Data Centers, a company based in Los Angeles that provides space for cloud-computing companies. ""Amazon brought a lot of young, smart people into Seattle, so now all the big tech companies feel they need to be there as well,"" he said. Critics still complain that Amazon is not involved enough as a corporate citizen. But one of the company's new office buildings will have a shelter for 200 homeless women, children and families built into the tower itself — the first such design in the world, company officials said. ""I still look at Amazon as a young company, a teenager,"" said Maud Daudon, the president of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce. ""They're on a path."" In Seattle, the company's growth became the catalyst for forces of anti-growth as housing prices soared and traffic worsened. The nation's first big-city $15-an-hour wage was passed here as Amazon rose. Home prices have risen faster in recent years than in any place in America. ""Amazon is simultaneously one of the most loved and most hated of organizations. It's this incredibly schizophrenic relationship,"" said David Rolf, the president of the Service Employees International Union 775, which represents 45,000 health care workers. Defenders of the company's impact said the huge and expensive expansion of mass transit that is underway now might not have happened if a sudden worsening of traffic had not underscored the need; voters rejected transit expansions multiple times here in the past. Others, like Will Martin, an architect who was walking on a recent morning near his office downtown, worry that the city could become too much of a one-company town, the way it felt in the old days when Boeing would sneeze and the city would pull up the blankets and stay in bed. ""Any downturn in Amazon would hollow out the city like the Boeing bust did in the 1970s,"" Mr. Martin said. Brace for a transformation of housing, demography and consumer demand. Here in Seattle, a city still defined by neighborhoods of single-family homes, about 8,000 new apartments are under construction within walking distance of the Amazon campus and are expected to be taken, the company says, mostly by employees. About 20 percent of the company's 40,000 workers already do not take any motorized transportation at all — they walk or bike. And more than one in six live and work in the same ZIP code. ""All of a sudden you're going to get 50,000 requests — why is the Wi-Fi not faster around here?"" said Mike Metzger, the chief executive at Payscale, a wage-analytics company that was founded in Seattle by three executives from Microsoft, and now has dozens of former Amazon workers in its 450-person work force. A fry cook can now earn $20 or more in Seattle, which has outpaced every other big city in the nation in the rate of wage increases over the last decade, according to figures from Payscale. But thousands of people have also come seeking opportunity, with many falling through the cracks. Over 11,000 people were homeless in King County on a one-night count this year. Home prices continued their dizzying upward spiral in 2017, nearly twice as fast as the second-fastest appreciating big city. Ed Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington, said the stresses and opportunities are combined. ""Other cities would kill to have the problems that Seattle has,"" he said. The priority, in his view, should be preserving the elements that allowed and encouraged Amazon to put down seeds and grow. ""What we want to do is maintain the culture that attracted Bezos in the first place,"" he said."
0,2017-11-17," Stitch Fix is an increasingly rare kind of start-up pursuing a public listing, because it has shown it can turn a profit. The question for investors is whether a company whose business could be swamped by Amazon — in this case, selling clothes over the internet — is a safe bet. Stitch Fix priced its initial public offering at $15 a share on Thursday, below expectations for $18 to $20 a share, as it embarks upon a new life as a publicly traded company. At that price, Stitch Fix raised about $120 million and was valued at about $1.5 billion. Yet going public is perhaps the least of the challenges that now confront the mail-order clothing service. When the company, based in San Francisco, begins trading on Friday — on the Nasdaq stock market, under the ticker ""SFIX"" — its viability as a stand-alone business will be a concern. Founded six years ago out of the apartment of its founder, Katrina Lake, Stitch Fix was not an obvious candidate for business success. Customers have little choice in which clothing they receive, and it does not promote particularly huge discounts for brand-name dresses and shirts. The way Stitch Fix works, in a nutshell: New customers fill out extensive forms listing their style preferences, clothing needs and price points. Computer programs then predict which items those customers are likely to want, and an army of 3,400 stylists refine those selections. Customers then receive five items via mail, shipping back articles they do not want free of charge. Should a customer keep everything in a box — a ""fix,"" in the company's jargon — they receive a 25 percent discount. ""I founded Stitch Fix to take on a very human problem: How do I find clothes I love?"" Ms. Lake wrote in a letter to potential investors that is included in the company's I.P.O. prospectus. ""Spending a day at the mall, or devoting hours of time to sifting through millions of products online is time consuming, overwhelming and neither effective nor enjoyable. I knew there had to be another way."" It is a business model that has been tried before, by the likes of the fellow clothing seller Trunk Club and the cosmetics retailer Birchbox. But Stitch Fix has managed to wring profits from the model two years in a row, earning $33.2 million in its 2016 fiscal year. (For the fiscal year ended July 29, it lost $594,000.) In some ways, Stitch Fix is unlike many Silicon Valley peers that promoted high valuations and higher spending rates as marks of success. Before its offering, the company raised only $42.5 million and kept its valuation relatively low, which would allow early backers to receive a bigger return on their investments should the company's total value increase once it is publicly traded. Its revenues have jumped every fiscal year since 2014. In its most recent fiscal year, which ended July 29, it collected $977.1 million in sales, surpassing last year's $730.3 million. The company disclosed that as of July 29, it had nearly 2.2 million ""active clients"" — those who place an order and then indicate whether they are keeping any items — compared with 1.7 million in the year-ago period. Having begun with women's clothing, Stitch Fix has steadily moved into other business lines, including men's and maternity. It has also been working on luxury offerings featuring higher-end labels. Stitch Fix's success is a testament in part to the widening fortunes of online retailers and their bricks-and-mortar brethren. Walmart has bet heavily on e-commerce, buying Jet.com for $3.3 billion and the men's clothier Bonobos for $310 million. Scores of traditional retailers have struggled. Macy's and other department stores have sold off some of their real estate to cope with declining sales. Toys ""R"" Us has filed for bankruptcy. And J. Crew, which has struggled to adapt to online selling, is among retailers for which a Chapter 11 filing is a distinct possibility. The initial offering will reap a windfall — at least on paper — for Stitch Fix executives like Ms. Lake and the company's few outside investors, including the venture firms Baseline Ventures, Benchmark and Lightspeed Venture Partners. (Benchmark invested in the company at a $300 million valuation three years ago.) Thanks to their owning a special class of stock, Ms. Lake and some early investors will continue to control the company even after the initial offering. But Stitch Fix's big sales growth cannot last forever. And the challenge that Stitch Fix faces is one that has burdened other start-ups like the food delivery service Blue Apron and the social networking phenomenon Snapchat: incumbent giants that have the money and the hunger to crush upstart rivals. In the case of Stitch Fix, the 800-pound gorilla in the room is Amazon, whose ambitions to stretch out into other industries have sent quakes throughout the business world. Indications that the e-commerce behemoth was moving into the pharmacy business were enough to compel CVS to pursue a takeover of the health insurer Aetna. Amazon's $13.4 billion takeover of Whole Foods Market was blamed for tanking Blue Apron's long-awaited initial offering this year. This summer, Amazon unveiled Prime Wardrobe, an offering that lets subscribers try on clothes at home and send back items they do not want at no charge. Analysts viewed the announcement as a shot across the bow of companies like Stitch Fix, though the company has argued that the newer service does not offer the level of personalization that has resonated with customers. ""Stitch Fix is not better stores, it's not better e-commerce, it's a better way,"" Ms. Lake asserted in her letter to potential investors."
1,2017-11-17," SAN FRANCISCO — Apple is putting the brakes on the arrival this year of HomePod, its much-ballyhooed rival to Amazon's Echo smart speaker. On Friday, the company said it would postpone the release of HomePod to early 2018. Apple introduced the speaker this year and was originally set to ship it next month, but the company said it was still working on the product. ""We can't wait for people to experience HomePod, Apple's breakthrough wireless speaker for the home, but we need a little more time before it's ready for our customers,"" Apple said in a statement. The postponement deals a setback to Apple in several ways. The company is already behind rivals like Amazon, which pioneered the market for speakers that can be controlled with voice commands and artificial intelligence with the release of the original Echo in 2015. The Echo, along with the virtual assistant Alexa, became a surprise hit. Now Apple will also miss out on selling HomePod during the holiday shopping season, the most lucrative time of year for electronics makers. That may enable rivals to gain even more traction with their products. Amazon recently released a family of new Echo products with lower prices. The standard-size Echo speaker costs $100, significantly less than its $180 predecessor. That makes the price for Apple's HomePod — $349 — look especially steep. Apple has said HomePod will deliver superior audio quality. Customers will be able to summon Siri, Apple's voice assistant, to play music and control smart home accessories. In addition, people will be able to link multiple HomePods to listen to music throughout the home, similar to products from Sonos."
0,2017-11-20," Jeffrey Tambor, the star of the Amazon series ""Transparent,"" will not return for the show's fifth season after two women accused him of sexual misconduct. Mr. Tambor has strenuously denied the allegations, made this month by one of his co-stars and by a former assistant. But in a statement to Deadline on Sunday, he announced his departure from ""Transparent,"" which he called ""one of the greatest privileges and creative experiences of my life."" ""I've already made clear my deep regret if any action of mine was ever misinterpreted by anyone as being aggressive, but the idea that I would deliberately harass anyone is simply and utterly untrue,"" he said. ""Given the politicized atmosphere that seems to have afflicted our set, I don't see how I can return to 'Transparent.'"" A spokesman for Amazon declined to comment on Sunday. However, officials there had already been considering writing Mr. Tambor off the show — in which he plays the lead character, Maura Pfefferman, a transgender woman — in response to the allegations. Van Barnes, a former assistant to Mr. Tambor, wrote in a private Facebook post this month that he had sexually harassed and groped her. Amazon officials opened an investigation, and Jill Soloway, the creator of ""Transparent,"" said she and others on the show were cooperating with it. Soon after, the actress Trace Lysette came forward publicly, saying that Mr. Tambor had ""made many sexual advances and comments"" and, on one occasion, physically assaulted her between takes for a scene in which both actors were wearing pajamas. ""My back was against the wall in a corner as Jeffrey approached me,"" Ms. Lysette said in her statement on Thursday. ""He came in close, put his bare feet on top of mine so I could not move, leaned his body against me and began quick, discreet thrusts back and forth against my body. I felt his penis on my hip through his thin pajamas, and I pushed him off of me."" At the time, Ms. Lysette said, she laughed and brushed off the episode — because Mr. Tambor was the star of the show and she had to work with him, and because she was accustomed to such mistreatment. ""Given the journey and circumstances of my life, I was used to being treated as a sexual object by men,"" wrote Ms. Lysette, who is a transgender woman. ""This one just happened to be famous."" Mr. Tambor, whose representatives did not immediately respond to phone calls and emails seeking comment on Sunday, has denied both women's allegations. He initially referred to Ms. Barnes as ""a former disgruntled assistant of mine"" and told Deadline that he was ""appalled and distressed by this baseless allegation."" And after Ms. Lysette's statement, he told The Hollywood Reporter that he was upset to ""find myself accused of behavior that any civilized person would condemn unreservedly."" ""I know I haven't always been the easiest person to work with,"" he said. ""I can be volatile and ill-tempered, and too often I express my opinions harshly and without tact. But I have never been a predator — ever."" In response to the flood of sexual harassment and assault allegations against prominent men in the past few weeks — from Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and Louis C.K. to the Senate candidate Roy S. Moore and Senator Al Franken — the executives behind many projects have been forced to decide what to do when a star becomes toxic. In some cases, these projects have been canceled. Netflix, for example, suspended production on ""House of Cards"" after its star, Mr. Spacey, was accused of making a sexual advance on the actor Anthony Rapp when Mr. Rapp was 14. (Allegations by many other men have been reported since.) And when a New York Times investigation revealed multiple allegations of sexual misconduct by the comedian Louis C.K., a distributor canceled the premiere of his movie ""I Love You, Daddy,"" and FX and other networks broke ties with him. But in her statement, Ms. Lysette urged Amazon not to cancel ""Transparent,"" but instead to ""remove the problem and let the show go on."" The series has been a leader in affirming and employing transgender people — both she and Ms. Barnes are transgender women — and they should not be punished for Mr. Tambor's actions, she said. Mr. Tambor, 73, is also known for his role in the TV series ""Arrested Development,"" which originally ran from 2003 to 2006 but has been revived twice since. Netflix recently finished shooting the fifth season, and it was unclear on Sunday how it would respond."
0,2017-11-21," The former Chinese official in charge of internet censorship, who hobnobbed with top executives from Facebook, Apple and Amazon and flatly denied that his government engaged in censorship, has been put under investigation by the Communist Party's anti-corruption agency, state media reported on Tuesday. The downfall of the censorship official, Lu Wei, was a long time coming. He once held a cluster of titles that gave him formidable influence over internet policy. But he was removed from many posts last year, suggesting that his career was under a cloud. The Chinese Communist Party's anti-corruption watchdog, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, signaled on Tuesday that Mr. Lu had been detained and was under investigation for corruption. He was suspected of ""grave violations of discipline"" — a euphemism covering graft, bribetaking and other abuses of power — the commission said on its website. It did not give any details of the charges against him. Mr. Lu is the most prominent Chinese official toppled over allegations of abuse of power since Xi Jinping started his second, five-year term as Communist Party leader at a congress last month. In his first term, Mr. Xi began a ferocious campaign against corruption and disloyalty that brought down dozens of senior officials. Mr. Lu's downfall showed that drive against graft will continue into Mr. Xi's second term as party leader and president, the Discipline Inspection Commission said in a comment on its website. ""Lu Wei being put under investigation by the organization is the best proof of this determination and drive,"" said the comment. Once, though, Mr. Lu, 57, seemed to swagger with confidence as the official directed by Mr. Xi to tighten the Communist Party's stranglehold over the internet. After his appointment to run the Cyberspace Administration of China in 2014, Mr. Lu became an outspoken and intimidating gatekeeper of China's internet. With his speeches and flamboyant dressing down of technology companies, he became an emblem of China's increasingly unapologetic internet controls. He chided American internet companies. Yet while visiting the United States, he was welcomed by powerful technology executives, including Tim Cook of Apple and Jeff Bezos of Amazon. At Facebook headquarters, Mark Zuckerberg showed Mr. Lu his copy of a book of Mr. Xi's speeches. In 2014, when asked why foreign social media sites such as Facebook were blocked in China, Mr. Lu denied any knowledge of the practice. ""I have never used any of these websites so I don't know if they have been shut down,"" he said. ""Your website is on your home soil. How can I go over to your home and shut it down?"" The next year, Mr. Lu denied that China engaged in internet censorship. ""It is a misuse of words if you say 'content censorship,'"" Mr. Lu said. ""But no censorship does not mean there is no management."" To quell what was perceived as a freewheeling social media, Mr. Lu went after some of the country's biggest internet personalities. At private dinners he threatened them, and on national television he scolded them. He also limited the functions and purged many of their accounts. Yet his high profile was also a liability. In China, government officials are generally dull and predictable, and Mr. Lu stood out, and often raised eyebrows. Even as his star was rising, rumors swirled about his possible fall from grace. At the World Internet Conference he helped create, he could be seen smoking cigars with a Cuban telecom official and power-walking in sweats for exercise in the morning. Still, he showed an impressive creativity at times. As head of the Cyberspace Administration of China, he asked the songwriter of the Beijing Olympic anthem to write a rousing choral number for his agency. In the chorus, employees warbled about China as ""an internet superpower."" The announcement of the investigation could help clear the air ahead of the World Internet Conference, scheduled for two weeks from now in Wuzhen, a canal town in eastern China. Presented as a sort of Davos of the internet, the meeting was conceived as a way to show off China's new influence over the technology industry. Analysts said that despite the public strutting of Mr. Lu, he had difficulty turning the Cyberspace Administration into a powerful regulator. Created in 2014, the agency was tasked with managing an internet and technology sector already overseen by several ministries as well as China's security organizations and the military. Mr. Lu will be succeeded by Xu Lin, who worked directly under Mr. Xi when he was briefly party secretary of Shanghai in 2007."

2,2017-11-21," When aspiring comedian Midge Maisel totters onto the stage for the first time at the Gaslight Cafe in Greenwich Village in the new Amazon series ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,"" she pauses to take in the auspicious moment. ""So this is the dream,"" she says. ""Standing up here on this filthy, sticky stage all alone."" But Mrs. Maisel had company. While stand-up comedy remained largely the province of men throughout the 1950s and '60s, a few women had begun to appear on club stages and late show couches. Here are a few of the first female comics and a selection of their zingers. As a 1950s comic who also sang, Carroll bridged the music hall comediennes of the past and the female stand-ups of the present. She had an elegant style, a sweetheart grin and an ultrafast patter, with routines full of husband jokes, shopping jokes and kid jokes. In the mid '50s, Diller cultivated a stand-up act in which she appeared as a ditzy homemaker who apparently dressed in the dark. (The outlandish outfits were meant to disguise a cute figure.) Diller's best-loved jokes, punctuated with a jackdaw's cackle, skewered her fictional husband, Fang. The most famous of the female borscht belt comedians, the 4-foot-11 Fields began working the Catskills and Boston burlesque joints in the '40s, while she was still a teenager. Her routines, delivered in a klaxon voice, were brassy and self-deprecating. Other comics made jokes about her weight, and she did, too. Even a leg amputation was comic fodder: ""I never had good legs anyway."" A veteran of minstrel shows and the Chitlin' Circuit, Mabley attracted mainstream attention in the '60s, when she played Carnegie Hall and often appeared on television. She recorded more than 20 albums of deep-voiced, loose-tongued jokes about sex, aging and racism. Ms. May began her career with the Compass Players in Chicago in the mid-50s, cultivating a style of sophisticated, absurdist sketch comedy. Her routines with Mike Nichols were sexy and brainy, sometimes abstruse. In one of their most famous sketches, Ms. May played a nagging mother to Nichols's aerospace engineer. Rivers's early '60s routines were talky single-girl riffs about her inability to land a husband. Wearing little black dresses and prim updos, she worked a style that was quick and brash and often angry — at men, at her mother, at a world weighted unfairly against women."
0,2017-11-22," After 14 years of staying home to raise her family, Melanie Colon landed a job for the holidays at a Target store in Queens, selling toys, bedsheets and linens. She hopes it will lead to a full-time position. ""For me, it's about getting back into the work force,"" she said. Ms. Colon, 36, is part of an army of temporary retail workers who are hired every year to help with the holiday shopping crush. Holiday hiring gives the economy an annual jolt, raising the incomes of hundreds of thousands of families at Christmas time and offering people like Ms. Colon a chance to make some income, even if only for a few months. But like so much about the retail industry, holiday hiring is in flux, even as stores are poised for a big shopping season. While some large retailers like Target are making a big push, others are hiring fewer temporary workers — or almost none at all. Walmart, the nation's largest retailer and private employer, has no plans for a hiring spree this holiday season. Instead, the company said it was giving ""millions more"" hours to its thousands of part-time employees, many of whom rely on Walmart as their only job. Across the country, retailers are expected to hire from 500,000 to 550,000 seasonal workers this holiday, down from the roughly 575,000 who were hired last year, according to the National Retail Federation. The decline reflects the forces buffeting the retail industry and the broader economy. With more sales moving to the internet, many brick-and-mortar stores are seeing less foot traffic, which means they need fewer workers manning the aisles. Retailers are also on pace to close thousands of stores this year. ""The industry is going through a transformation,"" said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist at the National Retail Federation. The sharp decline in the unemployment rate in recent years has created a tight job market, so fewer Americans need temporary work. With profits under pressure, the last thing that retailers want to do is to get into a bidding war for workers by substantially raising wages. The shifts are evident at Macy's. The retailer is synonymous with the holiday season, but there is little to cheer about on 34th Street this year. Macy's plans to close about 100 stores and its sales have declined for 11 consecutive quarters. This year the company said it would hire around 80,000 seasonal workers, about 4 percent fewer than last year. Nearly a quarter of those temporary workers, about 18,000, will be working in fulfillment centers across the country, in places like Goodyear, Ariz., and Martinsburg, W.Va. Macy's is trying to stem the flow of sales to Amazon by pushing an ""omni-channel"" strategy meant to be all things to all shoppers: a helpful and engaging shopping experience in stores, an alluring website and quick home delivery. It is a tall order that requires big investments. And, as if sensing weakness, Amazon is ratcheting up the pressure. The online-retail giant is hiring 120,000 seasonal workers, many of whom will pick, pack and ship boxes this Christmas. That is on top of the roughly 50,000 permanent workers it added at its fulfillment centers this fall. Conditions suggest that this will be a robust shopping season. Unemployment is low, consumer confidence is high and the stock market has been booming. As a result, holiday sales are projected to increase by as much as 4 percent from a year ago, to $682 billion, according to the National Retail Federation. ""This is as good as it gets,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ""If they can't survive in this environment, it is hard to imagine they will be around for very long."" Holiday hiring will be an important factor for retailers trying to impress, or, in some cases, win back shoppers. Bringing on too few workers could produce disheveled shelves and long lines — and sour shoppers even further on brick-and-mortar stores. Executives at Walmart said the decision to forgo adding thousands of seasonal workers was made partly because so many store employees, including those working part time, having been trained in how to navigate new technologies, like hand-held devices for pricing goods and tracking inventory. Training temporary workers on these systems, only to let them go after a few months, would be inefficient. ""This is the same approach we took last year, and we heard great feedback from our customers and associates,"" Walmart's chief operating officer, Judith McKenna, said in a statement. In the end, it is unclear how many additional hours Walmart workers can expect. The company is known as an industry leader in managing costs. Cynthia Murray, a founder of Our Walmart, a labor group, said she had heard from workers who had had their hours reduced in recent weeks, a move she thought was designed to lower costs before the holiday crunch. Staffing in the retail industry is often elastic and tends to mirror consumers' shopping habits. Many retailers cut back workers' hours when traffic to stores dies down, including in the fall, before the holidays arrive. ""During the holiday season, we have millions more hours available than we do during any other time of the year,"" a Walmart spokesman said in a statement. ""And for the second year in a row, we've made the decision to give as many of those hours as possible to current full- and part-time associates.'' Among large retailers, Target is making perhaps the biggest holiday hiring splash. The company plans to hire 100,000 seasonal workers, up from 70,000 last year, as it makes a push to improve the shopping experience in its stores and grab market share from some of its struggling rivals. In addition to hiring so many seasonal workers, the company said it was raising its starting wage to at least $11 an hour. Ms. Colon, the seasonal worker at the Target in Queens, said she saw an ad seeking holiday help on the retailer's website. Personally, she does much of her shopping online, but she thinks the stores are important. ""I have people come in and say 'I am buying this for my sister or I am buying this for my girlfriend,'"" she said. ""They want my opinion. You don't get that online."""
0,2017-11-23," LOS ANGELES — Four years ago, while filming ""Crimson Peak,"" the director Guillermo del Toro called Doug Jones into his office. The actor already had two small roles in the gothic romance — the hideous ghosts of a pair of long-dead mothers — but the director had another part in mind for him, a bigger one, in a film yet to come. Mr. del Toro spun a wondrous tale about a cleaning lady in an American research facility who falls in love with a mysterious merman fished from the murky depths of the Amazon. In this unlikeliest of monster movies, the creature was the hero and love interest, and the director wanted Mr. Jones to play him. It wasn't the first time the director had enlisted Mr. Jones, all 6-foot-3 of him, to play a fantastical creature. In a string of del Toro films stretching back to 1997, he has played a mutated insect (""Mimic""), a worm-spewing vampire (""The Strain"") and a spectral creature with blood-red eyeballs in the palms of his hands (""Pan's Labyrinth""). He's been an erudite fish-man (""Hellboy"" and ""Hellboy II""), an angel of death (""Hellboy II""), and a whimsical hybrid of human, tree and goat (""Pan's Labyrinth""). But this was the first time Mr. del Toro had called upon the actor to play both monster and leading man. Could Mr. Jones be convincing as an amphibian lover, the creature who gets the girl, all while sporting a bulky body suit and gills? ""Guillermo said, 'I know you're a good Catholic boy, and there's some romance involved in this one that might get steamy,' "" Mr. Jones recalled. Mr. del Toro explained further in an interview, ""There's a very rarefied strata of performer that can work with makeup and the suits, the many hours of prosthetic work and mechanisms whirring in your ears. And within that strata there's an even more rarefied one, and I think Doug stands alone, in which you can actually consider them proper actors."" On Friday, Mr. Jones stars in ""The Shape of Water"" as the captive of Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon), a Cold War-era Army colonel who hopes to gut him and study his innards, for science. The actress Sally Hawkins (""Blue Jasmine"") plays the mute janitor who woos him with boiled eggs, Benny Goodman albums and a winsome smile. ""He's a gift, isn't he?"" Ms. Hawkins said. ""It was so easy to fall in love with Doug."" The film won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival in September and has garnered rave reviews and early Oscar buzz. It has also been praised for its pro-Other political message and its spirited tweaking of monster movies past. In this version, the fishman from South America is the beauty, while Mr. Shannon's America-first colonel is the horrifying beast. On a recent evening, Mr. Jones, 57, was in the cafe at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, discussing his earliest days in the business and the challenges of playing a sexy merman. In addition to this latest film, the actor also stars in the CBS All Access series ""Star Trek: Discovery"" as a peace-loving alien whose people are prey animals back home (the character is a lot more heroic than that sounds). ""The reference they gave me was a gazelle,"" he said. ""Beautiful, graceful, but when pushed into a corner, they kick."" Nattily dressed in a white cardigan, striped blue tie and jeans, Mr. Jones was funny and animated, illustrating points with flourishes of his giant, pianist-like hands. Although he's spent a lifetime playing freaks, he's remarkably normal-looking in person, despite his protests, with high cheekbones and deep blue eyes. Born and raised in Indiana, the youngest of four boys, Mr. Jones was, as he recalled, ""tall and skinny and geeky"" as a child. He became a fan of offbeat TV characters like Barney Fife and Gomer Pyle in ""The Andy Griffith Show,"" and dreamed of appearing in sitcoms as the hero's goofy sidekick. ""Don Knotts was just a master and a king to me,"" he said. ""He was not what you would consider a classically handsome man, so I figured if he could make it, so could I."" At Ball State University, he fell in love with mime. His first job out of college was a gig as a roving mime at an Indiana theme park. ""Why is the painted man not talking?"" kids shrieked. ""I was basically scaring children all summer,"" he said. After moving to Los Angeles in 1985, Mr. Jones soon secured roles on commercials as a dancing mummy, a space alien and a nerd. The next year, he began appearing in a popular, long-running series of McDonalds ads as ""Mac Tonight,"" a piano-playing hipster with a giant crescent moon for a head. ""I bought my first house with that,"" he remembered. ""The reputation I got was that I was tall and skinny and moved well and wore a lot of crap on my face and didn't complain about it,"" he said. The ""not complaining about it"" part was key. ""Apparently, for actors,"" he said, ""that makes you exceptional."" Commercial work led to roles in features, including ""Hocus Pocus"" and ""Batman Returns,"" and collaborations with some of the biggest names in the creature-effects business, like Stan Winston and Rick Baker. When Mr. Jones first met Mr. del Toro, during the filming of ""Mimic,"" they bonded over their love of monsters and their creators. ""We were connecting on the level of grade-school boys, like, 'Did you see that monster? Wasn't it cool?'"" Mr. Jones said. ""The Shape of Water"" represents the fulfillment of a lifelong dream for Mr. del Toro who, as a young boy, saw the 1954 horror classic ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"" and fell in love with both the monster and its swimsuit-wearing object of desire. In a kinder world and film, he thought, who knows what might have been? ""He actually doodled pictures of the two of them riding a bike together, holding hands at the beach,"" Mr. Jones said. For his own creature, the director asked Mr. Jones to combine elements of the Silver Surfer (the Christlike superhero he played in a 2007 ""Fantastic Four"" film) and a matador. He also had to be like an animal in the wild. ""Guillermo would shout at me, animal, animal!"" he said. The lead creature designer and sculptor Mike Hill was tasked with creating the fishman's suit. ""The main direction I got from Guillermo was, 'Make him sexy,' "" he said. Mr. Hill got rid of the reptilian plates from an earlier design, and crafted a more kissable, less fishlike mouth. He gave the creature the broad shoulders and small waist of a swimmer, and a heroic cleft chin. And then there's the creature's hindquarters. ""Guillermo was adamant that we give him a sexy butt,"" Mr. Hill said. As lovely as the costume was, it was a bear to wear. For three hours a day, Mr. Jones sat while Mr. Hill and three other artists put the thing on: the foam latex suit and gloves, the fiberglass helmet with eyes he couldn't see out of, the sharp fangs, the remote-control gizmos in his spine. The suit itself was so form-fitting that Mr. Jones had to use K-Y Jelly to squeeze inside; when wet, which it nearly always was, it soaked up pounds of water like a sponge. ""He never complained once,"" Mr. Hill said. The cast and crew got a sense of what Mr. Jones endured every day when a professional dancer was brought in as a body double for a particularly challenging dance sequence. ""He got into the suit, did one pirouette, and then proceeded to projectile vomit,"" Mr. del Toro remembered. ""That's how good Doug is,"" Ms. Hawkins said. ""He couldn't see, he couldn't hear properly, and yet his performance is so beautiful and so delicate. He is the film. It just wouldn't work without him."""

0,2017-11-26," They seem like odd couples: Aetna, one of the nation's largest health insurers, is in talks to combine with CVS Health, which manages pharmacy benefits. The Cleveland Clinic, a highly regarded health system, joined forces with an insurance start-up, Oscar Health, to offer individuals a health plan in Ohio. Aetna also has new partnerships with large health systems that include hospitals and doctors' groups in Northern California and Virginia. These established players are venturing beyond their traditional lines of business, now that federal officials have quashed the mega-mergers proposed by the biggest insurers and blocked a  deal between two large drugstore chains.  Former adversaries are banding together, girding against upheaval in a rapidly changing health care environment. They are also bracing for the threats posed by interlopers like Amazon eyeing a foray into the pharmacy business or tech companies offering virtual medical care via a computer or cellphone. ""There's been a strong trend for health organizations to want to broaden their footprint, especially on the part of insurers to get more direct contact with the individual,"" said Dr. John W. Rowe, a former hospital and insurance executive who is a professor of health policy at Columbia University. Given the uncertainty over the Affordable Care Act and the potentially limited appeal of the core insurance business, insurers are looking to follow the strategy pursued by UnitedHealth Group. The big insurer, which acquired a chain of outpatient surgery centers earlier this year, has a wide array of profitable health care businesses like its own pharmacy benefit manager and various consulting arms through its Optum unit. While the companies promote these partnerships to employers and consumers as one-stop shopping, they could also put customers at a disadvantage by limiting their choices and increasing medical costs. Under these arrangements, people may not be able to see doctors outside the organization's own medical group. In addition, patients may worry that their doctor will decide not to order an expensive test to exact savings for the business partners — the insurer and the health organization. An in-house pharmacy benefit manager could direct customers to certain drugs because its manufacturer offers hefty rebates even if the medicine is more expensive or does not work as well as a competitor's. And the combined clout of the companies could push consumers' expenses higher. Employers that purchase coverage on behalf of their workers may also have difficulty determining how much they are paying for a given medicine or a particular service, said Edward A. Kaplan, a senior vice president at Segal Consulting. There's already a lack of transparency when it comes to drug prices, and employers may have even less information if the insurer and the pharmacy benefit manager are the same entity. ""It's going to be harder for us to get behind the curtain,"" Mr. Kaplan said. Companies are actively looking for partners that will provide an entree into new businesses or a new supply of customers. CVS Health, which started as a drugstore chain, operates a large pharmacy benefit manager as well as walk-in clinics in its drugstores. By combining with Aetna, which covers about 22 million people, CVS would be able to direct members to its own mail-order and pharmacy business and to its walk-in clinics, located in its drugstores, for much of their care. ""It's a sign of the continued integration in health care,"" said Tom Robinson, a partner for Oliver Wyman, a consultant that estimated there have been about 200 partnerships created between insurers and large health groups in the last five years. By sharing in the profits or losses of these ventures, the parties say they work more closely to make sure a patient gets the right medicine or has access to a doctor at a nearby clinic instead of resorting to an emergency room. The savings can be tangible. Anthem, which recently announced that it plans to start its own pharmacy benefit manager, estimated it could save $4 billion a year, the bulk of which it said would result in lower drug costs for customers. These partnerships can also represent a dramatic departure from the status quo. In many situations, an insurer and a hospital group would barely talk to each other outside a meeting every year or so to haggle over how much to pay for a knee replacement or an overnight hospital stay. The discussions rarely include how to better manage the care of a patient whose asthma goes untreated or has back pain that would be better treated with physical therapy. The contract negotiations between insurers and hospital systems tend to be ""a zero-sum game,"" said Brigitte Nettesheim, a senior executive with Aetna. Once the contract is signed, and a conflict arises over the cost or choice of a treatment, the patient is the one often caught in the middle. Aetna started offering joint plans with Inova, a large organization in Northern Virginia, in 2013. The partnership now covers more than 193,000 people. Patients see a doctor who belongs to a special network of primary-care physicians and specialists, most of whom are not employed by Inova but work together closely with the system to coordinate care for patients. Inova was able to finance the creation of this network through the joint venture, and it is now experimenting with new ways of paying the network's doctors so they bear more responsibility for the overall effectiveness of the care they deliver. If they save money by caring for the patient more efficiently, they share in the savings. Patients in these joint ventures are also assigned a nurse who helps them navigate the system. When a cardiologist prescribed a new cholesterol medicine that required a $200 co-payment, the nurse was able to call the doctor to find a less expensive alternative, saving the patient nearly $2,300 a year, Ms. Nettesheim said. ""It's about these open lines of communication,"" she said. When Banner Health, a large group based in Phoenix, partnered with Aetna to offer a joint health plan, it decided to add 35 retail clinics where people could get care after-hours or closer to their homes rather than show up in the system's emergency rooms. The clinics ""are lower-cost options for our members and more convenient,"" said Chuck Lehn, the president of the Banner Health Network. It's too soon to tell whether these new combinations will succeed in delivering on the promises made when they join forces. ""They just tied the knot,"" Mr. Robinson of Oliver Wyman said. ""Now they have to build the relationship."""

2,2017-11-26," MUMBAI, India — Americans shopping on Amazon.com this holiday season may find that the best deals for popular gifts like leather shoes and luxury bedding are coming from an unexpected source: Indian merchants. Amazon, always on the lookout for ways to lower prices, has been aggressively recruiting Indian vendors to sell their goods directly on the e-commerce giant's American site. At least 27,000 Indian sellers have signed up since Amazon began the outreach two years ago. They range from giants like the Tata Group, a conglomerate that hawks its Titan watch line on the site, to smaller firms like The Boho Street, a peddler of vegan tapestries, incense and handcrafted copper mugs. The result is lower prices for consumers because selling foreign goods through the e-commerce giant cuts out some of the usual costs of a traditional importer. But it is also beneficial to Amazon, which gets to add to its enormous product lineup and charge sellers hefty fees. For Indian merchants like Abhishek Middha, founder of The Boho Street, Amazon provides almost turnkey access to the American market. ""Amazon handles everything in the U.S., from shipping to customer handling, so we can focus on making the best quality products and adding more products to our catalog,"" he said. Although Mr. Middha used to sell on other marketplaces like Etsy, he switched almost entirely to Amazon two years ago because of its vast scale and suite of services. Last year, his sales on Cyber Monday spiked to four times the usual level, helping to propel his annual revenue to $1.9 million. On Black Friday this year, his sales tripled compared with the previous day. ""Amazon taught us how to create a brand,"" he said. The growth of Amazon's Indian global seller program shows how sophisticated the Seattle retailer's strategy has become. The company operates India's second-largest e-commerce site, Amazon.in, which caters to the country's growing base of online consumers. But Amazon also sees India as a source of cheap and high-quality products that can be sold on its American site, especially in  crucial categories like apparel, to help it take market share from competitors like Walmart. Abhijit Kamra, who heads Amazon's global selling program in India, said that Americans already buy many products that are made in India, such as cotton towels. ""What we are trying to do is compress the global supply chain and bring sellers and customers closer,"" he said in a phone interview. Some of the 75 million Indian products on the main Amazon.com site, such as saris, tend to attract customers of Indian heritage. But other categories, like jewelry and health products, have wider appeal, Mr. Kamra said. Amazon has listed many of its Indian products on a special page, Amazon.com/India, to help customers in the United States find them. For the holiday selling season that kicked off with Black Friday, the company spent months helping sellers prepare by stockpiling goods in the United States and programming special ""lightning deals"" to generate shopper interest. In some cases, the company even lent sellers money for inventory. The India program is quite lucrative for Amazon's bottom line. A merchant who chooses the full array of Amazon services, including buying advertising and contracting with the company to store and deliver the products from Amazon's American warehouses, typically hands over about one-third of the item's sale price in fees and commissions. These third-party sellers are crucial to Amazon's business, said Aaron Cheris, head of the Americas retail practice at Bain, a global management consulting firm. ""They make more money on their third-party stuff than on the stuff they sell themselves,"" he said in a phone interview. Amazon says that more than half of the units sold on its shopping sites come from such outside sellers. To attract customers on a crowded site like Amazon.com, it helps to have a niche. For Krishna Murari, the founder of Rajlinen, that niche is luxury cotton bedsheets for the odd-size beds in recreational vehicles. ""I have never seen an R.V.,"" said Mr. Murari, a former electronics engineer. But he learned about the specialty sheets from an American company that sells custom mattresses, and then studied images of camper mattresses. Now his factory in Indore, in central India, sells more than 10,000 R.V. bed sets per year in the United States, many of them custom sewn. Mr. Murari said buyers have little interest in camper sheets until June or July, so for the holidays, he is focusing on high thread-count percale sheets for regular beds. Mr. Murari often imitates designs sold by big American retailers, but tried to undercut them on price, selling his versions for about $30 a set, slightly below Target's prices and less than half of Bed Bath & Beyond's prices for similar items. At the start of the holiday shopping season, Rajlinen had about 42,000 sheet sets sitting in Amazon warehouses across the United States, waiting for orders to come in. Mr. Murari said his profit margin was low and he did not intend to offer big discounts over the weekend or on Cyber Monday, unlike many American retailers. His primary goal was to bring in enough revenue to keep his 115 workers employed. While Amazon.com has sellers hailing from many countries, Mr. Cheris said that India and China are the two most important places for Amazon to recruit new merchants, since both nations are sources of cheap manufactured goods. Unlike China, where local companies dominate e-commerce, India is also a huge domestic market for Amazon. Although most of India's commerce is conducted offline, Indians are coming onto the internet at a rapid clip through their smartphones. Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, views India and its 1.3 billion residents as vital to his company's future, and he has vowed to spend at least $5 billion building up his India operations. Flipkart, the top e-commerce site in India by volume, has pushed the central government to pass policies to protect local internet companies from unfair competition by foreign companies willing to lose lots of money. By promoting Indian exports, a top priority of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Amazon is positioning itself as a good corporate citizen. The Indian merchants selling on Amazon.com find their local site, Amazon.in, to be a less appealing marketplace. With a per-capita income of $1,600 a year, most Indians are unwilling to pay anything close to the prices that sellers can command in the United States. Raja Rajan, head of Boston Creative Company in Coimbatore in south India, has done well selling $13 engraved spoons and $60 folded book art on Amazon.com. He recently began selling the spoons on Amazon's Indian site, too. In the first six days, Mr. Rajan said in a phone interview, he did not have even one sale. Perhaps that was because Indians know how cheap such spoons are to produce. Mr. Rajan said his profit margin is about $8 a spoon — rich enough to allow him to slash prices on Black Friday and Cyber Monday and see what happens. ""We are going to cut the price in half,"" he said. ""I just want to try it."""
0,2017-11-28," Peter Thiel, Facebook's first outside investor, once wrote: ""Competition is for losers. If you want to create and capture lasting value, look to build a monopoly."" Executives at Facebook, Google and Amazon seem to have taken his blunt advice. If only the Trump administration could be so clear when it comes to its stance on competition. Instead, it has sent a schizophrenic message, which means the few remaining companies with a chance to rival big tech have no way of knowing where the administration stands or what values it will enforce. On the one hand, the F.C.C. has signaled it will eliminate net neutrality, the rule that ensures equal access to the internet for all websites. If this happens, internet service providers like Comcast, Verizon and AT&T will be able to charge extra fees for high-quality streaming and exclude certain content from the all-in data plans they offer. Critics say this move would be devastating to the websites and applications that can't pay the fees. On the other hand, just a day before the F.C.C. announcement, the Justice Department communicated starkly different values. Announcing its opposition to the proposed merger of Time Warner and AT&T, it used an argument based on the very kind of thinking that's often used to defend net neutrality: The department made the case that if the merger were allowed to go through, AT&T might favor the Time Warner content it would own post-merger, to the disadvantage of rivals. The incoherence of these conflicting positions on competition is staggering, but this kind of cognitive dissonance is not unique. Don't forget that the Obama administration — at the behest of Amazon, which controlled almost 80 percent of the online book market — brought an antitrust suit alleging Apple and five publishers colluded on pricing for digital books. That administration did not have a consistent view of media monopoly power that is enforced equally on all parties, and neither does the current one. For instance, internet service providers operate under a totally different set of privacy regulations than the online service providers (like Google and Facebook) that dominate the online advertising market. According to Morgan Stanley, Google and Facebook took an astonishing 85 percent of all new online ad revenue last year. And yet Google spends millions lobbying Congress to prevent any rivals from entering its unique surveillance capitalism business. Essentially, the government is giving a pass to the largest media advertising firms that have no restrictions on consumer privacy, while suing to block potential rival services that operate under strict privacy restrictions. It could be that the notion of net neutrality that the F.C.C. seems determined to jettison should also be applied to media monopolies. When the European Union fined Google $2.7 billion in June for unfairly favoring some of its own services over those of rivals, it was essentially for a violation of neutrality: The union noted that Google was both a service provider (that users could use to conduct searches) and a content provider (that provided its own restaurant, hotel and other product recommendations) and was favoring its own content in search results over that of rivals that also provided recommendations, like Yelp. Of course, being buried deep in Google's search results or being forced to pay Google for prominent placement hurts smaller firms. This is arguably no less harmful to a business than being forced to pay Verizon for good video quality for its streaming site — the fate that many content producers will meet if net neutrality rules are rolled back under the plan the F.C.C. has hinted at. It is what economists call ""rent seeking,"" and it is a cancer on any open media system in any context, but the Trump administration doesn't treat it the same in all contexts. Mr. Trump is nothing if not sensitive to a populist uprising, and the net neutrality decision will probably be opposed on both the left and right. It could be that during the F.C.C.'s comment period, the resistance to overturning net neutrality may be too strong and the ruling will be withdrawn. But that leaves the larger questions unanswered. What exactly would a consistent antitrust policy for the media sector look like? Is it possible to reconcile the conflicting signals from the F.C.C. and the Department of Justice? The answer is that regulators must realize where the real market power lies and use this as the basis for their decisions about competition. Time Warner's market capitalization is $70 billion. Google is worth 10 times as much, at $723 billion. Turner Broadcasting, Time Warner's largest advertising subsidiary, brought in $1.2 billion in ad revenue in the last quarter, while Google reported $22.5 billion in ad revenue in the same period. It should be noted that AT&T has almost no appreciable ad revenue. So, if there is to be a coherent approach to competition, the Federal Trade Commission, which regulates Google and Facebook, and the F.C.C., which regulates AT&T, must find common ground on the regulation of ad-supported content networks. For the Trump administration to try to block the merger of two relatively small media players while letting Google operate freely with no privacy restrictions is to be fighting the last war. The notion that television is the major media power in America ignores reality. It may be that the assistant attorney general for antitrust, Makan Delrahim, has a decent case that internet service providers and content providers need some sort of separation. But if that is true, then the same rules on neutrality and consumer privacy need to apply to companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon — and the F.C.C. should keep net neutrality rules in place. The administration can't have it both ways."
1,2017-11-28," Peter Thiel, Facebook's first outside investor, once wrote: ""Competition is for losers. If you want to create and capture lasting value, look to build a monopoly."" Executives at Facebook, Google and Amazon seem to have taken his blunt advice. If only the Trump administration could be so clear when it comes to its stance on competition. Instead, it has sent a schizophrenic message, which means the few remaining companies with a chance to rival big tech have no way of knowing where the administration stands or what values it will enforce. On the one hand, the F.C.C. has signaled it will eliminate net neutrality, the rule that ensures equal access to the internet for all websites. If this happens, internet service providers like Comcast, Verizon and AT&T will be able to charge extra fees for high-quality streaming and exclude certain content from the all-in data plans they offer. Critics say this move would be devastating to the websites and applications that can't pay the fees. On the other hand, just a day before the F.C.C. announcement, the Justice Department communicated starkly different values. Announcing its opposition to the proposed merger of Time Warner and AT&T, it used an argument based on the very kind of thinking that's often used to defend net neutrality: The department made the case that if the merger were allowed to go through, AT&T might favor the Time Warner content it would own post-merger, to the disadvantage of rivals. The incoherence of these conflicting positions on competition is staggering, but this kind of cognitive dissonance is not unique. Don't forget that the Obama administration — at the behest of Amazon, which controlled almost 80 percent of the online book market — brought an antitrust suit alleging Apple and five publishers colluded on pricing for digital books.

0,2017-11-29," SEATTLE — While Amazon is hunting for a second headquarters away from its hometown, its neighbor in the Seattle area — Microsoft — is doubling down on the region, with plans to invest billions of dollars in redeveloping its existing campus. The project, which Microsoft plans to announce at its annual meeting of shareholders on Wednesday, amounts to a major overhaul of the company's 500-acre campus in Redmond, Wash., the leafy Seattle suburb that it has called home since 1986. The company will take a wrecking ball to 12 old buildings, replacing them with 18 taller ones with more open work environments. The construction will add about 2.5 million square feet of new space to the roughly 15 million it has in the area, enough room for an additional 8,000 employees. Microsoft's redevelopment, which will take five to seven years to complete, would not ordinarily stand out — lots of technology companies outgrow their offices and need new space. But this is Microsoft, a company that spent years fumbling new initiatives, laying off employees and retrenching from key markets. The bet on a bigger, more modern campus is a symbol of its resurgence over the past few years under its chief executive, Satya Nadella, who has made invigorating Microsoft's culture one of his top priorities. It is also hard not to notice the contrast to Amazon, the area's younger and buzzier technology company. After Amazon announced its plans for a second headquarters, cities and regions laid out tax breaks and other promises to lure the planned 50,000 high-paying jobs to town. Amazon said it received 238 bids from across North America and is whittling down the list to a group of finalists, with a winner to be announced next year. Amazon's move has also caused much introspection in Seattle. One portion of the population worries that the area is losing its competitive edge. Another would not mind if Amazon and its tech ilk left the region entirely, along with the soaring housing prices, traffic and other symptoms of its booming economy. Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, said the company did not intend for its hometown expansion — which he described as a multibillion-dollar investment — as a comment on Amazon. ""I don't think we're out to make a statement about what anyone else is doing or not doing,"" he said. ""We think this is the right decision for us."" Still, Mr. Smith could not resist a slight dig. ""When it comes to headquarters, one is enough, we feel,"" he said. Today Microsoft's Redmond campus has most of the trappings found at the sprawling headquarters of tech giants in Silicon Valley — the soccer fields, manicured lawns and oceans of parking lots. That will not change on its renovated campus, but Microsoft is taking a different approach in other respects. The new buildings will be clustered closer together. They will also be taller — four stories instead of the two or three that are common now. There will be a new underground parking facility, a 2-acre open plaza that will serve as a central gathering place and new walking and cycling trails. ""There's an opportunity to build a somewhat denser campus and create a somewhat more urban feel,"" Mr. Smith said. Microsoft's older buildings are known for private offices with closing doors, many of them with the feel of rabbit warrens, with narrow corridors. The new buildings will have more open spaces to encourage collaboration. Microsoft has already started to renovate buildings to make them more open. The company's decision to stay put at its Redmond campus flies in the face of a trend among technology companies to gravitate closer to cities. The abundance of amenities, night life and public transportation in urban areas has led to thriving tech scenes in San Francisco, New York and other cities. ""My gut reaction is, 'Wow, they seem kind of out of touch,'"" said Dan Bertolet, a researcher at Sightline Institute, a nonprofit in Seattle focused on sustainability. ""All the young people I know who work in the tech industry out there want to be in Seattle. They pooh-pooh places like Redmond."" Tech companies are also finding that the talent they are after increasingly wants to live in cities, not suburbs. That has led suburban giants like Google, Facebook and Apple to operate large private bus services to ferry workers to their headquarters. Microsoft's own bus service has more than 94 buses and over 4,000 daily riders. But those buses also frequently sit in soul-crushing traffic. Possible relief for Microsoft's commuters will come in the form of light-rail that will connect it to Seattle. A light-rail station on Microsoft's campus is scheduled to open by 2023. Had Microsoft decided to move to Seattle rather than remain in the suburbs, the company would likely have faced severe criticism from affordability advocates, who are worried about lower income residents getting pushed out of the city. Mr. Bertolet said suburban areas outside Seattle tend to restrict the density of housing so they're not likely to develop an urban atmosphere without significant change. ""Maybe in the long term,"" he said, ""it's better to have a regional network of bigger cities, but getting there will be rough."""
0,2017-11-30," SEATTLE — The holidays are a time when there are constant reminders of how much Amazon dominates online shopping — the boxes stacking up on front porches, for example. It's also when Amazon puffs its chest out to say how big it is becoming in a different and much more profitable market: technology used by businesses. The company's self-confidence was on display on Wednesday at an annual conference in Las Vegas dedicated to Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing business. Amazon boasted of its leading cloud share, which analysts estimate is  more than 44 percent of the market. And it showed a parade of big companies, like Expedia and Walt Disney, that run its software inside Amazon data centers. One of the customers that Amazon revealed, the National Football League, illustrated how cloud computing is moving beyond basic capabilities like online storage. Those abilities first attracted start-ups and large corporations to the concept of renting computing services from an internet company, rather than running it all themselves. The N.F.L. said it would use Amazon's advanced machine-learning capabilities — software that helps recognize patterns and make predictions — to quickly analyze data captured during games. The data could provide new kinds of statistics for fans and insights that could help coaches. In a phone interview, Michelle McKenna-Doyle, the N.F.L.'s senior vice president of information technology, called the new game analysis it plans to offer using Amazon ""instant quarterbacking,"" a nod to Monday morning quarterbacking, the traditional postgame discussions fans often hold. Amazon is also becoming an official technology sponsor of the N.F.L.'s next gen stats, as the league's initiative is called. The N.F.L. and Amazon declined to discuss the financial terms of their relationship. Amazon also announced a handful of other new machine-learning efforts. Customers using A.W.S., as the cloud division within Amazon is often called, will be able to add capabilities that mimic human cognition, such as automatic transcribing of speech to text and analysis of videos. Those services are usually expensive and daunting for many companies to add to their applications Amazon also said it would begin selling a new camera with machine learning built into it, A.W.S. DeepLens, so software developers can practice with the technology. Amazon said the camera could allow a garage door opener to automatically open when it recognizes a license plate on a car. A.W.S. started as a curious side project for the internet retailer more than a decade ago. It has since mushroomed into one of the most important technology providers. It brought in over $12 billion in revenue for Amazon during the first nine months of the year, up 42 percent from a year earlier. More important, A.W.S. generated almost $3 billion in operating income, an enormous benefit to a company which brings in little to no profit from its retail operations. The chief executive of A.W.S., Andy Jassy, predicted in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday that the company's cloud business could eventually become the world's largest technology provider to businesses. To do so, it would have to displace large software companies like Microsoft and Oracle. Mr. Jassy tweaked established technology providers in a keynote speech, describing their treatment of customers as an ""abusive relationship."" Amazon has caught most of the industry by surprise with its growth into a cloud computing powerhouse. Two rivals, Microsoft and Google, have shown the most determination to narrow Amazon's lead. Both competitors are also investing heavily in giving machine-learning capabilities to customers. Urs Hölzle, Google's senior vice president of technical infrastructure, said his company saw the biggest opportunity in winning over the huge numbers of customers who have not yet shifted their computing chores to the cloud, rather than convincing those that have already adopted Amazon's services to do so. ""For us to grow very quickly, we don't need to steal A.W.S. users,"" he said."

2,2017-11-30," SIMI VALLEY, Calif. — On a recent afternoon on his expansive estate here, in a beautifully appointed living room the size of a mead hall, Jean-Claude Van Damme suddenly fired a high kick at my face, stopping short of crunching cartilage and bone. I didn't ask him to do it, but it was a thrill nonetheless. After all, he's aimed that very same foot at the heads of action superstars like Dolph Lundgren, Bolo Yeung and Sylvester Stallone. ""I still love martial arts,"" he said, breaking into a broad smile. ""Martial arts changed my life. If you were born in the dojo, you will die in the dojo."" It's hard to picture Mr. Van Damme, famed for his devastating reverse roundhouse and epic splits, not kicking somebody. Even in his lousiest pictures — ""I made lots of low-budget movies,"" he admitted — he's a thing of beauty, a graceful, whirling dynamo. He's Jean-Claude Van Damme, the Muscles from Brussels, in every movie he makes. So it's perhaps not such a surprise that, in his latest project, he's playing himself, sort of. On Dec. 15, Amazon Studios will release the first season of ""Jean-Claude Van Johnson."" In the meta-series, part comedy, part drama, he plays a broken-down action star who makes terrible films — like a kung-fu-filled remake of ""Huckleberry Finn"" — as cover for his real gig as a lethal black-ops agent, code named Jean-Claude Van Johnson. The series may be his weirdest project to date, no small feat for a guy who, in a career spanning four decades, has punched a rattlesnake (""Hard Target""), been crucified by pirates (""Cyborg"") and saved a baby from a wild tiger with the help of the former N.B.A. star Dennis Rodman (""Double Team""). In ""Jean-Claude Van Johnson,"" his first television drama series, the 57-year-old actor tackles no fewer than three roles. He plays a fictionalized version of himself, a time-traveling doppelgänger and a simpering, squeaky-voiced Bulgarian factory worker. It's a remarkable turnaround for this Belgian-born actor, who became a bankable action star in the 1980s and '90s in films directed by some of Hong Kong's greatest action directors, then watched as personal troubles — an addiction to cocaine, contentious divorces — scuttled his career. Rather than dodge the actor's sometimes rocky past, the series lovingly mocks it. Throughout the six-part series, references are sprinkled to Van Damme films and life stories from the past, including parodies of training sequences and nods to his years filming in places like Bulgaria and China. Dave Callaham, the creator and showrunner, and a longtime aficionado of Mr. Van Damme's work, leapt when he heard, in 2014, that Scott Free Productions, Ridley Scott's company behind TV shows like ""The Good Wife"" and ""The Man in the High Castle"" (and films like ""Blade Runner 2049,"" ""Murder on the Orient Express"" and ""The Martian""), was trying to come up with a TV series for the action star. A writer on ""Godzilla"" and ""The Expendables,"" Mr. Callaham knew action, but he had more than just another Van Damme martial arts flick in mind. He envisioned something high-concept, like the critically acclaimed 2008 Belgian film ""JCVD,"" which starred Mr. Van Damme playing himself as an unwitting participant in a post office robbery. ""I told them I'd like to play with the notions of who he is and what he represents in the culture,"" Mr. Callaham said. ""He was my favorite actor growing up, so I wanted to talk about the ups and downs of his career, and to do something that involved all those different worlds. And they said, great, we don't know what you're talking about."" But Mr. Callaham was very apprehensive about how Mr. Van Damme would react when he pitched the show. ""I didn't know J.C. personally, and I didn't know what his appetite would be for making fun of himself,"" he said. ""A lot of those guys, those '80s guys especially, are not open to that."" And the treatment he created for Scott Free was, as he recalled, ""insane."" (It opened with Mr. Van Damme as a forgotten sad sack who played Frisbee golf to stay in shape.) Without Mr. Callaham's knowledge, the folks at Scott Free sent the treatment to Mr. Van Damme, who loved it. A meeting was set up, but Mr. Callaham was still nervous about meeting his lifelong hero. As a self-described ""tiny kid"" growing up in the '80s, during the era of Arnold and Hulk Hogan, Mr. Callaham had idolized the smaller, speedier action star, and now he was finally going to meet him. ""I had a panic attack,"" he recalled. ""I locked myself in the bathroom at Scott Free and refused to come out."" He needn't have worried. ""J.C. was really friendly and nice,"" he said. ""He was aware of my credits, so he mainly wanted to ask me questions about 'Godzilla.' He had a lot of questions about 'Godzilla.'"" With the new show, Mr. Van Damme, a native French speaker, has no problem mocking his image. Dressed in a black ""Brussels, Belgium"" T-shirt and jeans, he spoke candidly about his early days in Hollywood trying to convince casting agents that he spoke English (""it was a catastrophe"") and about past roles. ""I made 40-plus movies where you see me with a gun and that one neutral face,"" he said. The series riffs on themes from those films, including time travel (the 1994 cult classic ""Timecop"") and doppelgängers (""Double Impact,"" from 1991), and spoofs the ""anything for a buck"" nature of Hollywood action films. In ""Huck,"" the show's film within a film, the hero is a brawling superpatriot in a straw hat (""I pledge allegiance to kicking ass,"" he says), Tom Sawyer is a woman (and Huck's lover), and Huck's runaway slave pal is changed from African-American to Chinese mid-production, in a shameless scheme to exploit the Asian market. The series also shows the softer side of Mr. Van Damme, who, in the film (and, one could argue, in life) is often his own worst enemy. ""I feel like he's on this real razor's edge between wanting to be very big and outgoing, and wanting to really keep to himself and be very private,"" said Kat Foster (""Weeds""), who plays his black ops sidekick and ex-girlfriend. ""I think 'J.C.V.J.' is a homage to the quieter parts of him, the parts of him that he prefers to hide."" As he awaits the international reaction to the show (which is set to air in more than 200 countries and territories), Mr. Van Damme is keeping busy on a variety of projects. He's helping train mixed martial arts fighters (in the past, he's worked with the Diaz Brothers and UFC champion Georges St-Pierre) and working to create a sanctuary for endangered animals in Australia. But he's most excited about the series, which he calls the highlight of his year, and which will have its world premiere on Dec. 12 at the Grand Rex theater in Paris. ""When I lost my 'Timecop' fame because of some stupidity, and then I didn't do any theatrical film for nine, 10 years except 'Expendables 2,' I said to my mother, before you go, mama, I'm gonna make sure I'm back in theaters, and we'll have a big premiere in Paris,"" he said. ""And now it's happening. She's 83, and everything I told my mama is happening now."""

0,2017-12-05," MELBOURNE, Australia — Amazon quietly began operations in Australia on Tuesday, the start of what could be a shake-up of that country's retail market, which is worth hundreds of billions of dollars. For Australian businesses, Amazon's international expansion — which now includes more than a dozen countries — has brought with it hasty pivots and familiar feelings of enthusiasm, doubt and existential dread. But people who posted on social media about Amazon's debut were generally underwhelmed, with prospective Australian customers playfully pointing out lackluster product offerings and uncompetitive pricing. One New York Times reporter spotted a pair of shoes listed in the website's cookware section, a sign of the site's growing pains. Some compared Amazon's unremarkable Australian debut with that of another digital giant: Netflix. When that service arrived in Australia in 2015, it offered a notably leaner offering of its streaming-on-demand product, especially in comparison with its American lineup. However, experts were quick to note that Amazon, the world's biggest retailer, had yet to flex its full retail muscles. ""I'd say it's early days — it's Day 1,"" said Jack O'Leary, a United States-based analyst at PlanetRetail RNG, a global retail insights firm. ""As you see more sellers come to the marketplace, you'll see a deeper assortment, depth, and price competition will only go up from there."" Mr. O'Leary pointed out that at Amazon's debut, the Australian marketplace had only a few hundred sellers — or third-party vendors — who are now listing their products on the site. Globally, the company has millions of sellers, a volume seen as key to Amazon's formula of providing large assortments of products at ruthlessly competitive prices. As the number of sellers increases — and the company's pricing algorithm takes hold — its penetration into the marketplace will improve significantly, he said. Major Australian retailers, in the meantime, have long since begun preparing for Amazon's entry into the marketplace. Some, like the electronics retailer JB Hi-Fi, expanded shipping offerings to include same-day delivery in certain regions. Others, like Harvey Norman, have doubled down on their physical presences — the company has placed what it calls flagship stores in Ireland and throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Gerry Harvey, the company's chairman, had previously said that Amazon would be ""idiots"" to begin its retail offering so close to Christmas. ""We haven't got to adjust to anything,"" said Mr. Harvey, who insisted that his business had not altered its plans in anticipation of Amazon's arrival. ""We've been in business now for 56 years. I've always been keen and able to be ahead of the pack. The minute someone gets ahead of us, I'll hand the badge in. They follow us, we don't follow them."" Mr. Harvey complained about the ""free publicity"" that Amazon had received in the lead-up to the debut, and said their retail offerings had never posted a profit. (The company's strategy is to build market share and pump the cash generated by its business into new growth initiatives like video streaming and devices.) Australians spend less on the internet than Americans or Europeans, but their spending there is growing, with eBay and major local electronics retailers catering to the national market. Mr. O'Leary, who has studied Amazon's impact globally, said that businesses seeking to match the company's product variety and pricing were fighting a losing battle. ""If you're trying to out-Amazon Amazon — well, there are very few retailers that can compete on that level,"" he said. ""Really, you need to differentiate from Amazon with some sort of unique assortment or product offering. Additionally, store-based retailers can take advantage of their retail presence."" But for some small business owners, the disruption has created opportunity. ""We've been following it very closely,"" Tristan Swanwick, the co-founder of Swanwick Sleep, an Australian company that sells sleep-aiding glasses, said of Amazon's debut in Australia. ""As soon as Amazon officially announced they were coming to Australia, we started sending emails and making phone calls"" to ensure they would be among the first to team up with Amazon in Australia, he added. Mr. Swanwick said his company initially started its business in the United States through Fulfilled by Amazon, a program that allows small businesses to have Amazon handle things like warehousing, delivery and customer service. ""It really lowers the barrier for entry for small businesses getting started in e-commerce,"" he said. Swanwick Sleep was among the first batch of merchants included in Amazon's Australian offering, easing its efforts to penetrate the Australian market. ""Our mother used her spare bedroom to store inventory for us,"" he said. ""She would go down to the post office, maybe two or three times a day, depending on demand, to send off orders to Australian customers."" ""She's one of the happiest people in Australia that Amazon is here — she gets her spare bedroom back,"" he added."

Some compared Amazon's unremarkable Australian debut with that of another digital giant: Netflix. When that service arrived in Australia in 2015, it offered a notably leaner offering of its streaming-on-demand product, especially in comparison with its American lineup. However, experts were quick to note that Amazon, the world's biggest retailer, had yet to flex its full retail muscles. ""I'd say it's early days — it's Day 1,"" said Jack O'Leary, a United States-based analyst at PlanetRetail RNG, a global retail insights firm. ""As you see more sellers come to the marketplace, you'll see a deeper assortment, depth, and price competition will only go up from there."" Mr. O'Leary pointed out that at Amazon's debut, the Australian marketplace had only a few hundred sellers — or third-party vendors — who are now listing their products on the site. Globally, the company has millions of sellers, a volume seen as key to Amazon's formula of providing large assortments of products at ruthlessly competitive prices. As the number of sellers increases — and the company's pricing algorithm takes hold — its penetration into the marketplace will improve significantly, he said. Major Australian retailers, in the meantime, have long since begun preparing for Amazon's entry into the marketplace. Some, like the electronics retailer JB Hi-Fi, expanded shipping offerings to include same-day delivery in certain regions. Others, like Harvey Norman, have doubled down on their physical presences — the company has placed what it calls flagship stores in Ireland and throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Gerry Harvey, the company's chairman, had previously said that Amazon would be ""idiots"" to begin its retail offering so close to Christmas. ""We haven't got to adjust to anything,"" said Mr. Harvey, who insisted that his business had not altered its plans in anticipation of Amazon's arrival. ""We've been in business now for 56 years. I've always been keen and able to be ahead of the pack. The minute someone gets ahead of us, I'll hand the badge in. They follow us, we don't follow them."" Mr. Harvey complained about the ""free publicity"" that Amazon had received in the lead-up to the debut, and said their retail offerings had never posted a profit. (The company's strategy is to build market share and pump the cash generated by its business into new growth initiatives like video streaming and devices.) Australians spend less on the internet than Americans or Europeans, but their spending there is growing, with eBay and major local electronics retailers catering to the national market. Mr. O'Leary, who has studied Amazon's impact globally, said that businesses seeking to match the company's product variety and pricing were fighting a losing battle. ""If you're trying to out-Amazon Amazon — well, there are very few retailers that can compete on that level,"" he said. ""Really, you need to differentiate from Amazon with some sort of unique assortment or product offering. Additionally, store-based retailers can take advantage of their retail presence."" But for some small business owners, the disruption has created opportunity. ""We've been following it very closely,"" Tristan Swanwick, the co-founder of Swanwick Sleep, an Australian company that sells sleep-aiding glasses, said of Amazon's debut in Australia. ""As soon as Amazon officially announced they were coming to Australia, we started sending emails and making phone calls"" to ensure they would be among the first to team up with Amazon in Australia, he added. Mr. Swanwick said his company initially started its business in the United States through Fulfilled by Amazon, a program that allows small businesses to have Amazon handle things like warehousing, delivery and customer service. ""It really lowers the barrier for entry for small businesses getting started in e-commerce,"" he said. Swanwick Sleep was among the first batch of merchants included in Amazon's Australian offering, easing its efforts to penetrate the Australian market. ""Our mother used her spare bedroom to store inventory for us,"" he said. ""She would go down to the post office, maybe two or three times a day, depending on demand, to send off orders to Australian customers."" ""She's one of the happiest people in Australia that Amazon is here — she gets her spare bedroom back,"" he added."

Here's what you need to know: • While the Republican tax overhaul would add up to an overall cut for individual taxpayers, at least through 2025, millions could face immediate tax increases. (Check the numbers for each income group here.) For those in high-tax (and Democratic-leaning) states, the increase would come from the repeal of the state and local tax deduction. New York City and its neighbors would be particularly hard hit, according to our overview of the bill's regional impact. ""Who's going to want to buy our house here in New York?"" a resident of an affluent commuter town said. ""The whole game has shifted."" • We also explain the push by Republican lawmakers to discredit a nonpartisan agency they had long praised, after it threatened to derail their $1.5 trillion tax rewrite. • The Supreme Court on Monday allowed the third version of the measure to go into effect while legal challenges continue. Most citizens of Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria and Yemen will be barred from entering the U.S., as will some Venezuelans. • The move suggests that the administration's chances of prevailing when the justices consider the ban have markedly increased. • Republican leaders are again coalescing around the Senate candidate in Alabama, with President Trump endorsing him on Monday and the party's national committee restoring its support. Mr. Moore has been accused of sexual misconduct against teenage girls. • Republicans appear increasingly confident that Mr. Moore will win the special election next week. Here's what has happened since the allegations against him emerged. • Representative John Conyers Jr., the Michigan Democrat who has been accused of sexual harassment, said today that he was leaving Congress immediately, and endorsed his son, John Conyers III, to replace him. Separately, a woman who reached a settlement with Bill O'Reilly over harassment allegations sued him and Fox News for defamation and breach of contract. • The Times has started a newsletter, The #MeToo Moment, in which our gender editor, Jessica Bennett, offers updates and analysis. Sign up here. • That's one analyst's assessment of what lies ahead after the killing of Ali Abdullah Saleh, the former president of one of the Arab world's poorest countries. His death on Monday shattered the alliance between his loyalists and Houthi rebels. ""His being killed like this is going to deepen the conflict,"" April Longley Alley of the International Crisis Group added. ""This just adds more layers of revenge."" • Renewed fighting in the capital, Sana, could worsen the humanitarian crisis, which the U.N. has called the world's worst. • The International Olympic Committee is to decide today how to punish Russia for its elaborate doping scheme in the 2014 Winter Olympics. Possible sanctions include a ban from the Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in February. But that could hurt the Winter Olympics more than it hurts Russia. • The Olympic committee has a history of being timid and slow in addressing delicate subjects. ""Spoiler alert: Some insiders say this thing is going to fizzle,"" our sports columnist  writes. Listen on a computer, an iOS device or an Android device. • CVS and Aetna promise better care and lower costs if they merge, but skeptics question whether the companies can deliver. • Facebook introduced an app for children ages 13 and younger, reigniting a debate over how young is too young for social media. • Google, which missed out on the rise of the internet in China, is determined not to make that mistake in India.

But I think this is going to get more and more attention, not just from crazy people with long hair."" — Josef Tumbrinck, a member of the Entomological Society Krefeld in Germany, which recently reported that insect populations there had dropped more than 75 percent in three decades. The Times headline was unassuming in its brevity: ""Claude Monet dies; famous painter."" A week after the French artist died on this day in 1926, we were more effusive, praising Monet as ""one of the names in the history of art to which will be attached a single idea, the idea of light."" Born in 1840, he was famous for outdoor scenes and for reproducing the effects of light, whether on water lilies, haystacks or the cities of Europe. Impressionism, the name of the movement he helped found in the 1870s, was derived from ""Impression, Sunrise,"" the title of his painting of the harbor of Le Havre in France. Coined derisively by a critic, the name was adopted by Monet and his fellow Impressionists, including Pierre Auguste Renoir and Camille Pissarro. Almost a century after his death, Monet still captures the public's imagination. Last year, his painting ""Meule"" fetched $81.4 million with fees, a new auction high for his work. The painting of a grainstack at sunset reflected the artist's long fascination with light. ""These landscapes of water and reflection have become an obsession for me,"" Monet wrote in 1909. ""It is beyond my strength as an old man, and yet I want to render what I feel."" _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern and updated all morning.

A pop-culture phenomenon that debuted in 2014, the show has collected Emmy Awards, Golden Globes and critical praise for telling the groundbreaking story of an aging college professor who comes out as transgender. But now ""Transparent'' is reeling in the wake of the same sordid allegations strafing the rest of the entertainment world after its star, Jeffrey Tambor, was accused of sexual harassment by a co-star and a former personal assistant. As Amazon investigates the complaints, the series is suspended in an agonizing limbo. For instance, Mr. Tambor was widely believed to be leaving ""Transparent"" after he issued a statement saying, ""I don't see how I can return."" Yet a representative for the actor disclosed to The Times recently that, in fact, Mr. Tambor had no plans to quit. Now the creators and writers of ""Transparent"" find themselves trying to construct a fifth season that may or may not include their central character, Mr. Tambor's Maura Pfefferman, while struggling to navigate the sudden upheaval of a show they believed was advancing an important cause both in front of and behind the camera. In interviews, several cast and crew members said that the socially progressive values of ""Transparent"" — with its embrace of transgender characters and its commitment to workplace inclusivity — made the accusations of sexual harassment all the harder to process. ""It was devastating,"" said Micah Fitzerman-Blue, a former writer and producer who is still in touch with many of the show's staff members. ""It's just incredibly sad that that happened in the midst of something that felt so revolutionary."" Perhaps most wrenching of all, the cast and crew grieved over the idea that a workplace they had thought of as part utopian experiment, part family — a ""wonderful cult,"" some members of the cast called it — had been compromised. ""Even in the safest of sets, where there were people who were really thinking constantly about how do we make sure we're heart-connected at work, things happened, or things may have happened,"" the show's creator, Jill Soloway, said on a panel a few days after the second of three women, the ""Transparent"" actress Trace Lysette, came forward with accusations about Mr. Tambor. Mx. Soloway, whose production company is called Topple — as in ""topple the patriarchy"" — had made the show's mission and its art virtually indistinguishable. (In the last few years, Mx. Soloway came to identify as gender nonbinary — neither woman nor man — and prefers gender-neutral language.) Mx. Soloway dotted the set with at least 60 transgender and gender nonconforming writers, actors and crew members, as well as many more extras, through what Mx. Soloway called the show's ""transfirmative action"" program. A pair of transgender artists-turned-producers vetted the story lines to ensure authenticity. There were sessions to teach set decorators, drivers and other staff members how to speak and write sensitively about transgender issues. ""We all feel like we're part of a greater good,"" Andrea Sperling, an executive producer, said. ""It's there to entertain, but it's part of something bigger than all of us."" Writers referred to Mx. Soloway's writers' room, with joking affection, as the ""writers' womb,"" a nurturing yet unpasteurized space where the intimate details of their own lives — including sexual proclivities, extramarital affairs and more quotidian memories — were discussed and then stirred into the show. Their willingness to explore any personal experience, no matter how graphic or private, gave the story lines some of their emotional rawness and sexual frankness, and the set its warm, freewheeling atmosphere. Yet the absence of boundaries could also create uncomfortable moments for anyone less willing to share; one former writer, speaking anonymously to discuss private work sessions, recalled texting a friend out of unease when the writers were asked about their masturbation habits. (Mx. Soloway said in a written response to questions that sex was just one of many things the writers talked about, and that it was common practice among television writers to mine personal experiences for content.) In interviews with writers, producers and an actress arranged by Mx. Soloway's personal publicist, Mr. Fitzerman-Blue was one of the few to say he believed the women's allegations against Mr. Tambor; most others would not discuss them. The first accusations surfaced last month when Mr. Tambor's former assistant on the show, Van Barnes, wrote in a private Facebook post that the actor had sexually harassed and groped her. Then Ms. Lysette, the actress who played Shea, told The Hollywood Reporter that Mr. Tambor had once thrust his pelvis against her hip while on set, kissed her on the lips several times and repeatedly made sexually suggestive remarks to her. Two of Ms. Lysette's friends — Rain Valdez, an actress who worked as a producer on ""Transparent,"" and Mindy Jones, a singer — said in interviews that Ms. Lysette had confided in them about Mr. Tambor's actions at the time. Another actress, Alexandra Billings, said in a statement to The Times that she had overheard Mr. Tambor tell Ms. Lysette, ""My God, Trace. I want to attack you sexually."" In an interview with The Times, Ms. Lysette said she hoped the show would evolve to focus on transgender experiences beyond those of Mr. Tambor's character. ""Like, come on,"" said Ms. Lysette, who is transgender. ""We have a lot to share, and the world wants to see it, and I just think that it sucks that so much rides on these leading men."" A third woman, a makeup artist named Tamara Delbridge, told the website Refinery29 last month that Mr. Tambor had forcibly kissed her in 2001 on the set of the film ""Never Again."" Mr. Tambor, who dedicated his best actor prize at the 2015 Golden Globes — among the first ever given for a transgender role — to the transgender community, said in his statement that he regretted ""if any action of mine was ever misinterpreted by anyone as being aggressive,"" but has denied the accusations. Mr. Tambor, too, produced a supporting account. In a statement provided by the actor's publicist, Allan Mayer, a hairstylist on the show, Terry Baliel, said that he had never witnessed the actor doing anything of an ""inappropriate sexual"" nature. In his own statement, Mr. Tambor referred obliquely to his own sense of discomfort with what was happening on ""Transparent,"" saying that a ""politicized atmosphere"" had afflicted the set. ""This is no longer the job I signed up for,"" he said. A few days later, in a new statement provided to The Times, Mr. Mayer expanded on Mr. Tambor's position: ""What he said was that given the toxic atmosphere and the politicization on the set, it's very hard for him to see how he can possibly return. But no final decision for next year has been made, either by Jeffrey or by Amazon."" He declined to elaborate on what Mr. Tambor meant by toxic atmosphere and politicization of the set. Responding to questions, Mx. Soloway wrote, ""I take what Van Barnes and Trace Lysette are saying very seriously,"" but declined to discuss the accusations, citing Amazon's internal investigation. ""Transparent"" may not have been the most popular series streaming on Amazon or its chief rival, Netflix. But it was among the most decorated, amassing awards and rapturous reviews and helping Amazon Studios burnish its reputation in the area of original content. Sarah Kate Ellis, the president of Glaad, the L.G.B.T.Q. media advocacy group, said ""Transparent"" had ""broken the mold, or created the mold"" for hiring transgender actors and other industry workers, who have historically faced barriers to employment in Hollywood. Yet it never quite outran concerns aired by transgender critics, some of its fans and even some of its own staff, that the showrunner and its lead star were not transgender and therefore unfit to tell transgender stories. Mx. Soloway had become ""deeply aware"" of the issue, but had ""hoped that being able to invite mainstream audiences into this family using a well-known actor was worth the trade-off,"" Mx. Soloway wrote in response to questions.

2,2017-12-06," A few weeks ago, Wyze Labs, a one-year-old start-up in Seattle, sent me its first gadget to try. It's a small, internet-connected video camera, the kind you might use for security or to keep tabs on your dog or your baby. On the surface, the camera doesn't sound special. Like home internet cameras made by Nest or Netgear, the Wyze device can monitor an area for motion or sound. When it spots something, it begins recording a short clip that it stores online, for access on your phone or your computer. But the WyzeCam has one groundbreaking feature that no rival can match. It is being sold for such an unbelievably low price — $20 — that it sent me tunneling into the global gadget industry to figure out how Wyze had done it. That, in turn, led to a revelation about the future of all kinds of products, from cameras to clothes. That future? We're going to get better products for ludicrously low prices, and big brands across a range of categories — the Nests and Netgears of the world — are going to find it harder than ever to get us to shell out big money for their wares. There's a hidden hero in this story — or, if you're a major brand, a shadowy villain. It's Amazon. To understand Amazon's role, let's take a closer look at how Wyze piggybacked off Amazon. Nest's and Netgear's comparable indoor cameras sell for around $200 each, while Wyze's device goes for $20 plus shipping if you buy directly from the company's website. The only other place to purchase the WyzeCam is on Amazon, where members of the company's Prime service can get it for $30 including two-day shipping. Wyze did not create a home internet camera for a tenth of the price of rivals by skimping on quality. Though the camera comes in extremely spare packaging, it otherwise offers many features you would expect in big-brand devices, including tough security. (Although all internet-connected devices pose some security risk, Wyze said its devices and the data they recorded were locked down with encryption.) Wyze's low prices are instead born of two ideas, both connected to Amazon. The company's three founders all worked at the retail giant, and they said they had been inspired by Amazon's high-volume, low-margin approach to sales. To hit the $20 price, Wyze licensed the camera's hardware from a Chinese company, then created its own software. It also cut out just about every middleman, including most retailers. And it's banking on long-run success. While Wyze is just breaking even on its first camera, its founders believe internet-connected home devices will be a growth category. They plan to establish a trusted brand with the first camera, then release a succession of products that they hope to sell in large numbers, at low prices. But how do you establish a brand online? That's the second place Amazon comes in. Though they snubbed every other retailer, Wyze's founders recognized that they needed an Amazon storefront to help them establish an instant presence next to the big guys. Customer rankings and reviews on Amazon have become just about the most important factor in how consumers buy electronics products; because Amazon pages come up high on search results like Google's, a positive rating on Amazon can effectively make a brand — and a negative rating can break one. ""That's why we had to sell on Amazon,"" said Yun Zhang, Wyze's chief executive. ""You just can't ignore them."" Wyze is now one of dozens of companies relying heavily on Amazon to create online brands. There's Anker, which makes low-priced, well-regarded accessories for electronics. There's Yi, which makes, among other things, action cameras that rival GoPro. And there are RAVPower, TaoTronics and VAVA, three consumer electronics brands owned by Sunvalley Group. Sunvalley, a Chinese company, said it would exceed $300 million in sales this year, with about 90 percent coming through Amazon. In an earlier time, you might have dismissed companies like these as ""Chinese knockoffs."" After all, like Wyze, most of them use commodity parts and global manufacturing efficiencies to create low-priced versions of relatively uncomplicated products. But knockoffs get a bad rap because they are of indeterminate quality: Even if it's selling at a good price, who wants to risk buying a no-name portable smartphone charger if it might blow up in your face? Allen Fung, the general manager of Sunvalley's American division, said that what was unique about Amazon was that its store encouraged low prices while heavily penalizing companies that made shoddy products. ""It's not a race to the bottom,"" Mr. Fung said. ""Sellers are forced to create better products at lower pricing, and sellers who aren't able to do that just get weeded out."" Mr. Fung recently spent a couple of hours providing an in-depth look at how he manages his company's brands on Amazon. To win a certain product category — portable chargers, say, or children's night lights — the company is obsessive about monitoring customer feedback, including the rate at which its products are returned. Sunvalley recently hired a team of customer service agents to respond to complaints. It has also hired industrial designers to improve the look of its devices — which also helps it stand out from other commodity devices on Amazon's results page. Sunvalley also spends heavily on Amazon ads (these show up as ""sponsored"" results on Amazon's search page), and sometimes it will sell products at a loss during one of Amazon's daily or seasonal deals to get a boost that lifts all of its products in the website's search rankings. All of these investments are costly and time-consuming, and competition on Amazon is intense. Mr. Fung said Sunvalley's gross margins were under 25 percent, which is quite low for consumer electronics. ""It's really tough,"" he said. ""There's a real process of natural selection there."" This process is not going to affect just the consumer electronics business. Mr. Fung said his teams regularly looked to Amazon as a kind of product road map — they look for categories dominated by high-priced items from well-known brands, and then try to create better, cheaper versions. Sunvalley has expanded into home appliances like lamps and humidifiers, as well as into cosmetics. Amazon, which charges a fee for third-party companies to sell through its platform, is not a passive actor in this trend. It has long encouraged businesses to set up shop on its site. The company said that half of its products came from small businesses, and that in 2016, more than 100,000 businesses exceeded $100,000 in sales through its system. It also started a lending program to allow those businesses to scale up; last year, its loans exceeded $3 billion. ""As this takes off, it really makes you start to question, you know, what is a brand in the Amazon age?"" said Scot Wingo, executive chairman of ChannelAdvisor, an e-commerce consulting firm. It's an intriguing question, and one that raises fears of Amazon's rise. While the growth of high-quality, low-priced brands on Amazon seems unquestionably good for consumers, the trend does produce economic losers. The classic worry about Amazon is that it puts local retailers out of business. Now another worry is that by exposing global brands to the harsh reality of low-priced competitors, it may put them out of business, too. Mr. Wingo said global brands across a variety of categories — electronics, apparel, home improvement — regularly approached his company looking for a way to compete with low-priced rivals on Amazon. He has had to let them know there's no easy solution, he said. ""There is this erosion of what it means to be a traditional consumer product brand,"" Mr. Wingo said. ""In a way, Amazon is providing all this information that replaces what you'd normally get from a brand, like reputation and trust. Amazon is becoming something like the umbrella brand, the only brand that matters."""
3,2017-12-06," Fingerlings, those colorful chirping monkeys (and sloths and unicorns) that wrap around your finger, have become one of the most desired toys on holiday shopping lists. Unfortunately, the $15 creatures are sold out online almost everywhere. Toys ""R"" Us? Gone. Walmart? None left in stock. Target? Nope. But check eBay or Amazon, and sellers are offering them for double, triple and quadruple their original price. There's even one on eBay being advertised for $5,000. Hot holiday toys have always been hard to find. The long list of heartbreakers includes Cabbage Patch Kids dolls, which caused parents to mob stores in the 1980s, Tickle Me Elmo in 1996, and a toy version of the ""Star Wars"" droid BB-8, which quickly sold out in 2015. But the proliferation of online shopping makes it even tougher to purchase coveted items because of software that snaps them up as soon as they are offered for sale. ""If it's popular, it's going to be taken by bots and resold,"" said Omri Iluz, the co-founder and chief executive of the cybersecurity firm PerimeterX, in a phone interview. The bots work by constantly pinging retail websites, searching for sales and analyzing URLs. The moment an item is in stock, the software runs through the checkout process at a speed that is ""completely inhuman,"" said Mr. Iluz, whose company protects large retailers and other organizations from bot attacks. The bots are drawn to scarce items ""like sharks to blood"" and use web-scraping techniques to guess the ID of an unreleased product, PerimeterX explains on its website. That allows scalpers to buy products before an official sale becomes public. Bots can also subscribe to online notifications of sales and bypass purchasing limits set by retailers by using multiple internet addresses. Laura Oliver, who blogs about deals on her website, A Frugal Chick, has been keeping tabs on Fingerlings, the brainchild of the company WowWee, for months, and notified her readers on Facebook whenever she found a retailer that had them in stock. It was an all-consuming job. ""I have had dreams about Fingerlings,"" she said. On Amazon, Fingerlings priced at $15 will sometimes last as long as 25 minutes, Ms. Oliver said. ""They are the only one that if I throw it up on social media I feel like my people have a chance to get it before it disappears,"" she said. ""I've had readers comment that they've put the Fingerlings in their cart on the Walmart website and when they go to check out, it's gone."" Walmart did not respond to a request for comment. Toys ""R"" Us says on its website that Fingerlings are available in its brick-and-mortar stores. When asked about the cyber bots, the retailer declined to comment, referring instead to a statement from Christin Fernandez, vice president for communications for the Retail Industry Leaders Association that said retailers and suppliers ""are working around the clock to make sure American families have access to the season's hottest items"" and are ""committed to taking precautions to mitigate fraud and illegal transactions."" Amazon said Tuesday that it monitors bot buying activity, and attempts to limit the purchase of high-demand products. Target has also taken measures to deter resellers, said a company spokesman, Eddie Baeb, ""including quantity limits for purchases and technologies designed to help us monitor and prevent reseller activity."" Other hot toys, like the Barbie Hello Dreamhouse, the L.O.L. Surprise! Doll and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System NES Classic Edition have also sold out, but are appearing on Amazon and eBay advertised at prices several times higher than retail. ""The entire ecosystem breaks down,"" Mr. Iluz said. Bots are making legal purchases, but they don't become loyal customers, and they won't leave positive reviews. And customers get frustrated. ""When an advertised item is unavailable because of out-of-stocks, customers don't blame bots, they blame the retailer,"" Roger Beahm, a professor of marketing at the Wake Forest University School of Business, said in an email. On Sunday, Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, asked retail trade associations to take action. ""When it comes to purchasing products online, major retailers should put forth policies that will help prevent future Grinch bots from stealing the season's hottest toys,"" he said in a statement. Unusual purchases ought to raise a red flag said Angelo Roefaro, a spokesman for Mr. Schumer. ""Say there's a suspicious order placed — for example a massive quantity at extreme speed — they should be able to have some human intervention in that transaction and potentially block the sale,"" Mr. Roefaro said in an email. David French, senior vice president for government relations at the National Retail Federation, said in a statement Monday that the federation shares Mr. Schumer's concerns, ""and we look forward to working with him and all interested parties to strengthen enforcement against bad actors and take away the tools being used against innocent consumers, particularly during the holiday season."" Mr. Schumer co-sponsored the Better Online Ticket Sales Act, or BOTS Act, which was signed into law last December, and is targeted at online ticket scalpers. The law makes it illegal to bypass ticketing website security measures, and would fine hackers who seek to circumvent the system. Ticket-scalping bots were partly responsible for the ""Hamilton"" ticket shortage and also snatched up tickets for other shows that were in high demand, like a U2 concert where a single scalper bought more than 1,000 tickets in under a minute, according to an investigation by the New York State attorney general. Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who also co-sponsored the BOTS Act, said in a phone interview Tuesday that he aimed to introduce new legislation to combat the ""plague"" of bots that buy up toys, sneakers and other popular retail items. ""I think if there was a specific law it would encourage and empower the Federal Trade Commission or criminal investigators to go after them, and we might learn more about them and identify some of the specific culprits,"" he said. For parents who were left empty-handed after searching for popular toys, there are still plenty of gifts out there that children will love — like Magna-Tiles or the Hatchimals that were so hard to find last year. The yearly rush to buy the hottest toy is often guided by emotions, Mr. Beahm said. ""Sometimes it's important to remain a little more rational in our purchase decisions,"" he added, and to remember the fate of fad items like the Beanie Babies, which are now ""practically worthless."""

0,2017-12-08," Each Friday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week's news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here. Mike: Ahoy, Farhad! How was your week? Mine was great. I forgot I had an old Bitcoin wallet sitting in a closet somewhere, and as it turns out, I am now a millionaire. I wonder if I should keep my job? Farhad: Did you really? Many years ago I spent $1,000 to buy seven Bitcoins. Then the price went up slightly and I stupidly sold them — netting me a cool $150 in profit. I felt like a genius. Today, I'm the dumbest man ever. Mike: Yes, well, don't come crawling to me for Bitcoins any time soon. I'm not made of money. (Yet.) Mike: Seriously though, this week in Bitcoin news was truly insane. The digital currency shot to more than $17,000 per BTC, up from $12,000 literally just a few days ago. It's totally nuts. Nathaniel Popper, our trusty colleague, has done a fantastic job chronicling the saga for The Times, if you haven't read his work this week. It kind of feels like those stories I heard years ago about hyperinflation in Zimbabwe, where people would cart around wheelbarrows of cash that wouldn't be worth the paper they were printed on. But, uh, I guess the opposite of that. All of this seems completely unsustainable to me. And by the time our readers read this newsletter, I can't even fathom what the price is going to be. Farhad:  I don't think it's unsustainable. I'm not a fortune teller, but even though the market is very volatile, Bitcoin has achieved a level of stickiness in the culture that will keep its price fairly high. Like all network technologies (as well as currencies), Bitcoin gets its utility from the number of people who are committed to it. There are lots of people and technologies around the world now hooked into it, and they are slowly coming up with uses for it, giving it a kind of built-in momentum. In other words, even though it may crash in the short run, I don't think it's near its ultimate price. Mike: O.K. — well, basically what I'm asking is, should I start asking The Times to pay me in Bitcoin? Farhad: Wait, you get paid? That sounds like an error of some kind. Mike: I'll ask H.R. about it next week. I do wonder, though, what it will take to bring Bitcoin truly mainstream. I'm a tech-savvy person, and even I need to read an entire Wikipedia article just to figure out what I'm buying with a Bitcoin and how to spend it. Makes me think there's not a lot wrong with cash (though many finance wonks would probably disagree with that assessment). Mike: Meanwhile, the reckoning against misbehaving men continues. Right now, we're in the middle of watching a Silicon Valley battle play out against Shervin Pishevar, an early investor in Uber who has been accused of sexual harassment by several women. Bloomberg did a piece detailing how he brought a pony to an Uber party — yes, really — and later harassed an Uber executive the same evening. Farhad: You skipped the best part of that piece — a defender who argues that Shervin couldn't possibly have harassed anyone because he was holding the pony's leash. Mike: Ah, yes. The old ""holding the pony leash"" defense. I believe Matlock pioneered this approach. Regardless, the claims were furthered on Thursday when Laura Fitton, an entrepreneur, became the first woman to go on the record saying Pishevar crossed the line with her in an encounter years ago. No ponies this time, though Fitton said Pishevar referred to himself repeatedly in the third person as ""Shervy,"" which is pretty awful even without adding claims of harassment. Anyway, my biggest takeaway from our Harvey Weinstein coverage is that he wasn't just one guy harassing women. Weinstein exercised amazing power and control over an enormous network to keep his activities secret from the public for years. That required the complicity of hundreds of people to keep him doing what he was doing. I imagine that type of power is hardly confined to the entertainment industry, and we're seeing the cracks in that facade play out in other areas — including tech. Farhad: Yup. Like in entertainment, much of what happens in the tech world happens through networks of power and proximity. The only way to have long-lasting change in this industry is to replace those old networks with new, more inclusive ones. We may be at the start of that transition now, but there's going to be a lot of fallout before we get there. Mike: Before we go, I found this report fascinating: Apparently some of the biggest firms in advertising plan to increase their ad buying budget on Amazon between 40 and 100 percent next year, an attempt to move away from the digital advertising duopoly that is Facebook and Google. I'm all for shifting the balance of power away from those two companies, who have managed to decimate the publishing industry in record time. But do we really think Amazon is the place to do it? You probably know better than I, since you just wrote a good piece on Amazon. Farhad: Yeah, it's a good question. More and more I feel like our future is going to be dominated by battles between these huge corporations. And none of us really has a lot of power in this — advertisers, consumers, we've all got these complex decisions to make about which of the giants to go with. We saw another big battle this week: Google once again blocked YouTube on Amazon's devices, in retaliation, its says, for Amazon refusing to sell Google's hardware in its store. Pick your side, consumer! Mike: Well, that's enough chitchat for me today. See you next week! I'll be over on Reddit, conspiring with my fellow Bitcoin millionaires.

4,2017-12-08," At lunchtime Thursday, Miguel Lopez paused on his rounds in Elmhurst, Queens. He got hired part-time for United Parcel Service when he was 23. That was two decades ago. A small start-up mail order company called Amazon was then in its early days selling books online, a blip that became a behemoth. The part-time job has ballooned so much that what is part-time is his life outside work. ""Yesterday, I did 113 stops,"" Mr. Lopez said. ""I touched a little less than 200 pieces."" Gustavo Escobar, 36, a U.P.S. driver on a route in Forest Hills, Queens, looked over a list of his own work. ""It's 209 stops,"" he said. ""Some of them are multiple packages."" This year, a cascade of online purchases the weekend after Thanksgiving swamped delivery companies. U.P.S. had hired 95,000 seasonal workers, but that was not enough. Packages were delayed. Last Friday, thousands of workers around the country were told that they would have to work a sixth day. ""They told me to come to work on Saturday, less than 24 hours beforehand,"" Mr. Escobar said. ""I had scheduled medical appointments. With my personal situation, I had visitation with my son, who is 9."" Despite the instruction, Mr. Escobar, who has been with the company 14 years, did not go to work Saturday. On Monday, he got notified about a disciplinary process. So did about 70 other workers in the New York area. The same conflicts arose in a half-dozen other U.P.S. hubs around the country, Steve Gaut, a spokesman for the company, said. Eddie Villalta, the president of Local 804 of the Teamsters, protested, and the workers around the country are also represented by Teamsters locals, so presumably this will be thrashed out. The dispute is a reminder, though, that Mr. Escobar and Mr. Lopez and legions of others in the delivery business work on the edge of the tectonic shift in how people buy goods. Bricks and mortar have dissolved into flesh, blood and trucks. Wages and benefits make U.P.S. an attractive employer. Mr. Escobar said he earns about $35 an hour, plus health care and retirement. The dwindling prospect of work or real estate investment in malls has been replaced by the surge of possibilities in the delivery world. This year, U.P.S. expects to deliver 750 million packages in the month after Thanksgiving, not quite double the load of 440 million in 2010. So the outlook for employment in shipping is good, at least until drones start delivering packages, like the owls who bring Harry Potter his mail. ""I'm very grateful,"" Mr. Escobar said. ""This volume brings us security."" But, he said, his workweek runs 48 to 60 hours, making a day off more precious. He will report to work this Saturday for his sixth day — reluctantly, because he will have to make arrangements for child care. Mr. Lopez is a shop steward with the union. ""I knew what I signed up for close to 20 years ago,"" Mr. Lopez said. ""I tell people, this is not a nine-to-five job. Sometimes, it's nine to seven, or nine to nine, or nine to 10. They put a lot more pressure on us to deliver everything."" Mr. Gaut of U.P.S. said the company had planned for growth from last year, but had been surprised by the sheer number of packages it had to deliver last week. Measures that it took to spread out the delivery period, like charging higher prices at certain times, had not been enough, he said. ""There has to be a level of predictability for the company and for the employees,"" he said. Federal rules limit the hours that truck drivers can work to 60 hours over seven days, or 70 hours over eight days, Mr. Gaut said. Then a worker must get 34 hours off. Mr. Lopez said that the employees are pressed to watch the limits, while being pushed to carry more packages. ""The demands have been getting worse and worse as the years go on,"" Mr. Lopez said. ""The volume has skyrocketed. There's so much work that they don't even know what to do with it."" It bothered Mr. Escobar that he was pushed at the last minute to work an extra day, and that he was threatened with disciplinary action because the company was apparently unprepared. ""I want to say this: I love this job,"" he said. ""Building relationships, seeing the joy on people's faces when you bring their stuff, that feels good. Somehow, I'm going to have get that extra cup of coffee and do it."""
0,2017-12-14," Aging male movie stars have been taking roles that play off their macho personas for a long time now — Clark Gable in ""The Misfits,"" John Wayne in ""True Grit,"" Sylvester Stallone in just about everything. It's not always clear how aware the actors are that they're playing versions of themselves. In the new Amazon series ""Jean-Claude Van Johnson,"" it's not a question — Jean-Claude Van Damme plays Jean-Claude Van Damme, a former action star on the downside of a career that peaked more than 20 years ago. The question is whether Mr. Van Damme is so in on the joke that he forgets it's supposed to be a joke. Although occasionally funny, ""Jean-Claude Van Johnson"" sits in an odd no-man's-land between clever self-parody and aggrieved vanity project. Even as the show is sending up Mr. Van Damme's signature balletic splits and his troubled personal life, the tone wobbles — you're not sure whether you're supposed to be laughing along with him or giving him a shoulder to cry on. The show's creator, Dave Callaham, has worked on an industrial version of this sort of thing, writing the screenplay for ""The Expendables 2,"" in which Mr. Van Damme appeared. In ""Van Johnson"" the joke is that the fictional Jean-Claude's movie career was a cover for his real career as a deadly secret agent. Retired and bored, he wheel-kicks his way back into both jobs in order to pursue a former love. Mr. Van Damme, Mr. Callaham and Peter Atencio, who directed all six episodes, have a lot of fun with that premise. Jean-Claude's comeback vehicle is a low-budget ""action adaptation"" of ""Huckleberry Finn,"" shot in Bulgaria, an echo of the long stretch of Mr. Van Damme's career when he couldn't get work in Hollywood. There are constant references, many made by Jean-Claude himself, to past Van Damme opuses like ""Timecop,"" ""Double Impact"" and ""Bloodsport."" There's also a seam of weepy nostalgia and sentimentality, as Jean-Claude recalls a (fictional) childhood as an orphan on an emu farm and seeks redemption from his younger self. This is certainly intentional — the show is satirizing Mr. Van Damme's well-promoted sensitive side, a move he already made in the 2008 film ""JCVD"" — but it's not particularly funny, and it makes the show drag. As far as Mr. Van Damme and Mr. Callaham are willing to go in deconstructing the star's career to date, you get the feeling they're not willing, or able, to go all the way — the kicks don't land full force. When Jean-Claude says, ""No one has looked for me here for 20 years"" and the camera pans to a Blockbuster sign, it's a good joke, but who's it on, Jean-Claude Van Damme or Blockbuster? As it is, it plays as a sad comment on a movie business that no longer has room for mid-budget martial-arts filler. ""Jean-Claude Van Johnson"" is fine, if ultimately unfulfilling, as a three-hour binge, and Mr. Van Damme, who turned 57 in October, is still in fighting shape. It's in a subgenre where the quality is rising, though, with Keanu Reeves's kabuki version of himself in the ""John Wick"" movies and Christopher Meloni's genius self-parody in Syfy's ""Happy!"" Mr. Van Damme needs to kick a little higher."
1,2017-12-14," LOS ANGELES — In a move that will reverberate from Hollywood and Silicon Valley to TVs and smartphones around the world, the Walt Disney Company said Thursday that it had reached a deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox, the empire controlled by Rupert Murdoch, in an all-stock transaction valued at roughly $52.4 billion. While the agreement is subject to the approval of antitrust regulators — and the Justice Department recently moved to block a big media company, AT&T, from becoming even bigger — Disney is acknowledging that the future of television and movie viewing is online. The acquisition, which would make Disney a colossus unlike anything Hollywood has ever seen, is the biggest counterattack from a traditional media company against the tech giants that have aggressively moved into the entertainment business. Disney has already announced an ambitious plan to introduce two streaming services by 2019. With this deal and the wealth of movies, TV shows and sports programming it provides, the company will now have the muscle to challenge Netflix, Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook in the fast-growing realm of online video. ""The pace of disruption has only hastened,"" Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive and chairman, said in an interview. ""This will allow us to greatly accelerate our direct-to-consumer strategy, which is our highest priority."" At the same time, the agreement means that one of moviedom's most celebrated studios, 20th Century Fox, will be downsized, with some operations folded into Walt Disney Studios or refocused to make films for online distribution. Founded in 1935, the Fox studio championed Marilyn Monroe, produced classics like ""The Sound of Music,"" released the first ""Star Wars"" movie and, more recently, turned ""Avatar"" into the biggest ticket-seller of all time. But lately, as most of Hollywood has, 20th Century Fox has struggled to keep pace with the changing way younger audiences view content — namely on an internet-connected device. Some analysts interpreted Mr. Murdoch's sudden willingness to sell as his reading the writing on the wall: The business climate is going to become tougher for old-line Hollywood. To complete the integration, a legacy-defining task, Mr. Iger, 66, agreed to renew his contract for a fourth time, delaying retirement from July 2019 to the end of 2021 and effectively ending speculation about whether he might run for president in 2020. Mr. Murdoch asked Mr. Iger to stay as a condition of the deal, which was valued at $66.1 billion including debt. As part of the acquisition (if it goes through) and his extension agreement, Mr. Iger will receive restricted stock awards — many tied to performance — worth more than $100 million, Disney disclosed on Thursday in a regulatory filing. Once the combination is complete, Disney will bump up his performance-based annual target bonus by 66 percent, to $20 million. Not included in the acquisition: Fox News, the Fox broadcast network and the FS1 sports cable channel. In the news release announcing the Disney deal, Mr. Murdoch said he would spin those businesses and a handful of other properties, including the 20th Century Fox lot in Century City, which Disney is not buying, into a newly listed company. Mr. Murdoch also still controls his newspaper-focused company, News Corporation, which has holdings that include The Wall Street Journal. The deal got its start with a casual get-together over the summer at Moraga Vineyards, Mr. Murdoch's Bel Air winery. There, Mr. Iger and Mr. Murdoch chatted about the way technology was roiling the media business, according to Mr. Iger, who came away thinking — to his surprise — that Mr. Murdoch might be open to a merger discussion. Mr. Iger said he called him a few weeks later in August to propose more serious talks. There was at least one due-diligence meeting at Mr. Murdoch's apartment in Manhattan with senior management. As the agreement was being completed on Tuesday, Mr. Iger had lunch with Mr. Murdoch in London. (Mr. Iger was in town for a premiere of ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi,"" which arrives in theaters on Friday.) ""I know a lot of people are wondering, 'Why did the Murdochs come to such a momentous decision?'"" Mr. Murdoch said on a conference call with investors. ""Are we retreating? Absolutely not. We are pivoting at a pivotal moment."" Mr. Murdoch's older son, Lachlan, 21st Century Fox's executive chairman, added that the move was ""about returning to our roots as a lean, aggressive challenger brand"" that would be ""focused at the beginning on must-watch news and live sports."" There has been speculation that Mr. Murdoch's other son, James, who is chief executive of 21st Century Fox, would join Disney in a senior role. Mr. Iger told investors on a conference call that that had not yet been decided. ""He will be integral to helping us integrate these companies over the next number of months,"" Mr. Iger said. ""Over that time, he and I will continue to discuss whether there is a role for him here or not."" The Murdochs declined an interview request. Disney, which owns ABC and ESPN, hopes 21st Century Fox will supercharge its plans to introduce two Netflix-style streaming services. Disney's first major streaming effort, ESPN Plus, will arrive in the spring. A second and still unnamed offering, built around the company's Disney, Marvel, Lucasfilm and Pixar brands, will roll out late next year. Rounding out its streaming portfolio will be Hulu, an established service that focuses on older viewers with programming that includes ABC shows. Mr. Iger is buying 21st Century Fox's minority stake in Hulu, resulting in majority control of the streaming service by Disney, which previously owned 30 percent. Comcast and Time Warner also have stakes in Hulu. The Disney-Fox merger is happening as the Justice Department fights AT&T's $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner in court. Mr. Iger acknowledged that antitrust regulators would heavily scrutinize Disney's purchase but expressed confidence about winning their approval. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said Thursday that President Trump had spoken with Rupert Murdoch and ""congratulated him"" on the deal. It was a striking contrast to Mr. Trump's negative view of the AT&T deal, which some have interpreted as an attempt to punish CNN, the Time Warner-owned network that is often the focus of Mr. Trump's ire. AT&T and Time Warner are not direct competitors, however, and some antitrust experts have said the Disney-Fox deal should receive similar  scrutiny. Should it not, the Justice Department could face criticism regarding its political independence. ""If they look at it from a consumer point of view,"" Mr. Iger said, ""they should quickly conclude that the aim of this combination is to create more high-quality product for consumers around the world and to deliver it in more innovative, more compelling ways."" When Mr. Iger announced Disney's streaming strategy in September, he said, ""We're going to launch big, and we're going to launch hot."" At the time, his comment was viewed in Hollywood as old-fashioned showboating. Not anymore. Disney is buying the Fox television studio, which has 36 series in production, including ""The Simpsons,"" ""Homeland,"" ""This Is Us"" and ""Modern Family."" Disney's significantly smaller TV factory, ABC Studios, has delivered series of inconsistent quality and lost its biggest hitmaker in August when the ""Grey's Anatomy"" producer Shonda Rhimes decamped for Netflix. To augment ESPN Plus, Disney is adding 21st Century Fox's chain of 22 regional cable networks dedicated to sports, including the YES Network, which carries New York Yankees games. As part of the deal, Disney will also get the FX and National Geographic cable networks, and stakes in two behemoth overseas television-service providers, Sky of Britain and Star of India. That component of the deal would seem to contradict Disney's push to lessen its reliance on traditional television, a business built on third-party cable subscriptions that is now in decline as people turn to streaming services for home entertainment. But those assets serve another of Mr. Iger's strategic goals: making Disney more of an international player. Disney has major operations in Europe, Japan and China, where it opened Shanghai Disneyland last year. But most of Disney's profit still comes from the United States, where ESPN dominates, despite recent struggles, and annual attendance at Walt Disney World in Florida and the Disneyland Resort in California totals 162 million people. With the acquisition, ""Disney goes from being a juggernaut to being a megajuggernaut,"" Steven Cahall, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients. Mr. Cahall and other analysts said the acquisition would likely prompt other entertainment companies to join forces as a competitive maneuver. Speculation immediately surrounded Viacom and CBS, which share common ownership; Lionsgate, which owns Starz; Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which controls rights to the James Bond franchise; and Sony Pictures Entertainment, which has struggled with low box office market share. Since taking over as Disney's chief executive in 2005, Mr. Iger has greatly expanded Disney's theme park operations, opening in Shanghai against all odds and nearly tripling the size of Disney Cruise Line. Walt Disney Studios, bolstered by Mr. Iger's acquisitions of Pixar, Lucasfilm and Marvel, has become Hollywood's runaway leader. But pulling off the acquisition of 21st Century Fox dwarfs those deals and will create complex integration challenges. Some executives who work at Fox's studio offices in Los Angeles have been complaining bitterly about the prospect of Disney cost-cutting. Disney said it expected the acquisition to yield at least $2 billion in total cost savings. And though Mr. Iger played down any antitrust issues, others in Hollywood have already disagreed. ""The antitrust concerns raised by this deal are obvious and significant,"" the screenwriters' union, the Writers Guild of America West, said in a statement on Monday, calling media consolidation a ""relentless drive to eliminate competition."""
2,2017-12-14," Aging male movie stars have been taking roles that play off their macho personas for a long time now — Clark Gable in ""The Misfits,"" John Wayne in ""True Grit,"" Sylvester Stallone in just about everything. It's not always clear how aware the actors are that they're playing versions of themselves. In the new Amazon series ""Jean-Claude Van Johnson,"" it's not a question — Jean-Claude Van Damme plays Jean-Claude Van Damme, a former action star on the downside of a career that peaked more than 20 years ago. The question is whether Mr. Van Damme is so in on the joke that he forgets it's supposed to be a joke. Although occasionally funny, ""Jean-Claude Van Johnson"" sits in an odd no-man's-land between clever self-parody and aggrieved vanity project. Even as the show is sending up Mr. Van Damme's signature balletic splits and his troubled personal life, the tone wobbles — you're not sure whether you're supposed to be laughing along with him or giving him a shoulder to cry on. The show's creator, Dave Callaham, has worked on an industrial version of this sort of thing, writing the screenplay for ""The Expendables 2,"" in which Mr. Van Damme appeared. In ""Van Johnson"" the joke is that the fictional Jean-Claude's movie career was a cover for his real career as a deadly secret agent. Retired and bored, he wheel-kicks his way back into both jobs in order to pursue a former love. Mr. Van Damme, Mr. Callaham and Peter Atencio, who directed all six episodes, have a lot of fun with that premise. Jean-Claude's comeback vehicle is a low-budget ""action adaptation"" of ""Huckleberry Finn,"" shot in Bulgaria, an echo of the long stretch of Mr. Van Damme's career when he couldn't get work in Hollywood. There are constant references, many made by Jean-Claude himself, to past Van Damme opuses like ""Timecop,"" ""Double Impact"" and ""Bloodsport."" There's also a seam of weepy nostalgia and sentimentality, as Jean-Claude recalls a (fictional) childhood as an orphan on an emu farm and seeks redemption from his younger self. This is certainly intentional — the show is satirizing Mr. Van Damme's well-promoted sensitive side, a move he already made in the 2008 film ""JCVD"" — but it's not particularly funny, and it makes the show drag. As far as Mr. Van Damme and Mr. Callaham are willing to go in deconstructing the star's career to date, you get the feeling they're not willing, or able, to go all the way — the kicks don't land full force. When Jean-Claude says, ""No one has looked for me here for 20 years"" and the camera pans to a Blockbuster sign, it's a good joke, but who's it on, Jean-Claude Van Damme or Blockbuster? As it is, it plays as a sad comment on a movie business that no longer has room for mid-budget martial-arts filler. ""Jean-Claude Van Johnson"" is fine, if ultimately unfulfilling, as a three-hour binge, and Mr. Van Damme, who turned 57 in October, is still in fighting shape. It's in a subgenre where the quality is rising, though, with Keanu Reeves's kabuki version of himself in the ""John Wick"" movies and Christopher Meloni's genius self-parody in Syfy's ""Happy!"" Mr. Van Damme needs to kick a little higher."
3,2017-12-14," LOS ANGELES — In a move that will reverberate from Hollywood and Silicon Valley to TVs and smartphones around the world, the Walt Disney Company said Thursday that it had reached a deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox, the empire controlled by Rupert Murdoch, in an all-stock transaction valued at roughly $52.4 billion. While the agreement is subject to the approval of antitrust regulators — and the Justice Department recently moved to block a big media company, AT&T, from becoming even bigger — Disney is acknowledging that the future of television and movie viewing is online. The acquisition, which would make Disney a colossus unlike anything Hollywood has ever seen, is the biggest counterattack from a traditional media company against the tech giants that have aggressively moved into the entertainment business. Disney has already announced an ambitious plan to introduce two streaming services by 2019. With this deal and the wealth of movies, TV shows and sports programming it provides, the company will now have the muscle to challenge Netflix, Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook in the fast-growing realm of online video. ""The pace of disruption has only hastened,"" Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive and chairman, said in an interview. ""This will allow us to greatly accelerate our direct-to-consumer strategy, which is our highest priority."" At the same time, the agreement means that one of moviedom's most celebrated studios, 20th Century Fox, will be downsized, with some operations folded into Walt Disney Studios or refocused to make films for online distribution. Founded in 1935, the Fox studio championed Marilyn Monroe, produced classics like ""The Sound of Music,"" released the first ""Star Wars"" movie and, more recently, turned ""Avatar"" into the biggest ticket-seller of all time. But lately, as most of Hollywood has, 20th Century Fox has struggled to keep pace with the changing way younger audiences view content — namely on an internet-connected device. Some analysts interpreted Mr. Murdoch's sudden willingness to sell as his reading the writing on the wall: The business climate is going to become tougher for old-line Hollywood. To complete the integration, a legacy-defining task, Mr. Iger, 66, agreed to renew his contract for a fourth time, delaying retirement from July 2019 to the end of 2021 and effectively ending speculation about whether he might run for president in 2020. Mr. Murdoch asked Mr. Iger to stay as a condition of the deal, which was valued at $66.1 billion including debt. As part of the acquisition (if it goes through) and his extension agreement, Mr. Iger will receive restricted stock awards — many tied to performance — worth more than $100 million, Disney disclosed on Thursday in a regulatory filing. Once the combination is complete, Disney will bump up his performance-based annual target bonus by 66 percent, to $20 million. Not included in the acquisition: Fox News, the Fox broadcast network and the FS1 sports cable channel. In the news release announcing the Disney deal, Mr. Murdoch said he would spin those businesses and a handful of other properties, including the 20th Century Fox lot in Century City, which Disney is not buying, into a newly listed company. Mr. Murdoch also still controls his newspaper-focused company, News Corporation, which has holdings that include The Wall Street Journal. The deal got its start with a casual get-together over the summer at Moraga Vineyards, Mr. Murdoch's Bel Air winery. There, Mr. Iger and Mr. Murdoch chatted about the way technology was roiling the media business, according to Mr. Iger, who came away thinking — to his surprise — that Mr. Murdoch might be open to a merger discussion. Mr. Iger said he called him a few weeks later in August to propose more serious talks. There was at least one due-diligence meeting at Mr. Murdoch's apartment in Manhattan with senior management. As the agreement was being completed on Tuesday, Mr. Iger had lunch with Mr. Murdoch in London. (Mr. Iger was in town for a premiere of ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi,"" which arrives in theaters on Friday.) ""I know a lot of people are wondering, 'Why did the Murdochs come to such a momentous decision?'"" Mr. Murdoch said on a conference call with investors. ""Are we retreating? Absolutely not. We are pivoting at a pivotal moment."" Mr. Murdoch's older son, Lachlan, 21st Century Fox's executive chairman, added that the move was ""about returning to our roots as a lean, aggressive challenger brand"" that would be ""focused at the beginning on must-watch news and live sports."" There has been speculation that Mr. Murdoch's other son, James, who is chief executive of 21st Century Fox, would join Disney in a senior role. Mr. Iger told investors on a conference call that that had not yet been decided. ""He will be integral to helping us integrate these companies over the next number of months,"" Mr. Iger said. ""Over that time, he and I will continue to discuss whether there is a role for him here or not."" The Murdochs declined an interview request. Disney, which owns ABC and ESPN, hopes 21st Century Fox will supercharge its plans to introduce two Netflix-style streaming services. Disney's first major streaming effort, ESPN Plus, will arrive in the spring. A second and still unnamed offering, built around the company's Disney, Marvel, Lucasfilm and Pixar brands, will roll out late next year.

0,2017-12-15," Jean-Claude Van Damme pokes fun at his meathead persona in a new Amazon series. And Mark Wahlberg tries to save the Gulf Coast in ""Deepwater Horizon."" JEAN-CLAUDE VAN JOHNSON on Amazon. ""I made 40-plus movies where you see me with a gun and that one neutral face,"" Jean-Claude Van Damme self-deprecatingly told The Times last month. The Muscles from Brussels will have quite a lot more to do in this new show, in which he plays not only a version of himself — a broken-down action star leading cheap movies — but also a time-traveling doppelgänger and a simpering factory worker. The show reveals Mr. Van Damme's softer side, but, of course, leaves plenty of screen time for his flying fists. WORMWOOD on Netflix. ""Stranger Things"" has brought the MK-Ultra project — in which C.I.A. subjects used LSD to attempt mind control during the Cold War — back into the cultural consciousness, with terrifying depictions of their experiments. Errol Morris (""The Thin Blue Line"") goes one step further in this new docu-series, in which he investigates the suspicious fate of Frank Olson, an Army scientist who was given LSD days before he plunged to his death in 1953. The show intersperses archival footage with dramatic re-enactments starring Peter Sarsgaard as Olson. TROLLHUNTERS on Netflix. With its grotesque monsters and ability to conjure overwhelming dread, Guillermo del Toro's work typically isn't meant for children. But this series, which he made with DreamWorks, is targeted toward a younger audience, and was partly inspired by his childhood explorations of the vast sewer system below his hometown, Guadalajara, Mexico. (""I wanted to do a series that I could imagine watching with a glass of milk on the couch with my dad and my brothers,"" he said in a Times interview.) Season 2 arrives on Friday; it follows Jim (voiced by Anton Yelchin, who died in 2016) as he explores a teeming land of trolls below his quiet street and defends the human and troll worlds against evil forces. DEEPWATER HORIZON (2015) 8 p.m. on HBO. Mark Wahlberg stars in this re-enactment of one horrible day in 2010, in which a BP oil rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico, killing 11 and damaging a vast marine ecosystem. The spill was later deemed the largest environmental disaster in U.S. history. Peter Berg directed this drama with suspense and precision.

0,2017-12-18," One of the perks of being a technology columnist is getting to test lots of gadgets before they're available to the general public. As a result, my apartment has at times resembled a Best Buy showroom. I have installed Bluetooth door locks; Wi-Fi-connected lights that can be turned on and off by talking to my Amazon Echo; and a remote-controlled bidet on my toilet. (Don't ask about that last one.) But of all the hardware products I've used this year, my favorite wasn't the iPhone X or some newfangled VR headset. It was a $99 electric multicooker called the Instant Pot, made by a tiny Canadian company called Double Insight. It's become a viral phenomenon online, and has inspired a legion of devoted fans who call themselves ""Potheads"" and hang out in a Facebook group with 850,000 members. On Black Friday, the Instant Pot was one of the top 5 sellers on Amazon. It's this holiday season's must-have gift — a Furby for foodies — and it seemed to come out of nowhere. Recently, I decided I wanted to know more about this strange little gadget. So I emailed Robert Wang, the Instant Pot's inventor and the chief executive of Double Insight, to ask if I could visit the company's headquarters in Kanata, a suburb of Ottawa, for an article this week. Mr. Wang seemed surprised. (Ottawa in December is not exactly a dream destination for journalists.) But he agreed to host me, and give me a peek at the company's inner sanctum. I arrived on a warmer-than-expected Wednesday, and we spent nearly four hours talking about Mr. Wang's upbringing in China, his Ph.D. in computer science, and how he spent $350,000 of his own savings developing the Instant Pot after being laid off from his technology job in 2008. He also told me about some unorthodox ways people are using their Instant Pots, like the arts-and-crafts buff who creates sculptures out of popsicle sticks, and uses her Instant Pot to steam the sticks to make them bendable. In addition to being a hit product, the Instant Pot is also a fascinating business story. These days, most big hardware advances come from companies like Apple and Samsung, which have thousands of engineers and billions of dollars to spend on research and development. But Instant Pot, which has only about 50 employees and never raised outside funding, has been able to reach enormous scale with none of those advantages. It's a testament to the power of word-of-mouth marketing, and proof that not all useful innovation comes out of Silicon Valley. The column I've written for the Times since last summer, called ""The Shift,"" is an attempt to make sense of all of the seismic changes happening in the business-and-tech world. That includes both addressing the big topics on everyone's radars (last week, I wrote about how wrong I'd been about Bitcoin) and ferreting out this kind of story, which more often goes ignored. I should admit upfront: Unlike my colleague Melissa Clark, who saw the Instant Pot's virtues well before I did, I am not an accomplished cook. I spent most of my 20s as a five-days-a-week Seamless junkie, and started learning how to cook for myself only in the last year or two. But since I got an Instant Pot as a gift last summer, my kitchen game has leveled up considerably. The Instant Pot's main draw is its pressure-cooking function, which can cook unsoaked beans or soften tough cuts of meat in a half-hour or less. But it can also sauté, steam, and slow-cook, and its idiot-proof interface is perfect for … well, me. It's now my go-to device for weeknight dinners — in the past few weeks, I've used my Instant Pot to make green Thai curry, butternut squash risotto, and a reasonable facsimile of a beef bourguignon. By the way: The best use I've found for the Instant Pot is cooking raw beets. Beets are the greatest vegetable on God's green earth, but roasting them the conventional way takes hours and gets red stuff all over your hands. Now, I just put a few beets in the Instant Pot with a steamer rack and an inch of water, turn on the high-pressure mode, and wait 20 minutes. They come out warm and soft, with skins that slip right off. No more red hands! Normally, I'm skeptical of new product hype. The tech industry has an ignoble record of overselling its innovations and making even the smallest incremental advances seem like huge leaps forward. (How many times have I been pitched a ""world-changing"" start-up that turns out to be ""Tinder for insurance agents"" or whatever?) But in the Instant Pot's case, I had already spent several months experiencing the product's benefits, and talking to Mr. Wang convinced me that this device might represent an actual, lasting shift in the way people cook and eat. In addition to making me more useful in the kitchen, the Instant Pot also has a calming effect on my frazzled, tech-addicted brain. Partly, it's because cooking dinner is one of the only times of day that I'm not fidgeting with my phone or looking at the news. But it's also the device itself. When you finish pressure-cooking a meal in one, you open a little valve on top, which produces a soothing hissssssss for the next few minutes while the pressure releases. It's become my version of a meditation bell. I'm still not a good cook. But I'm a lot better than I was. And for that, I have Mr. Wang's invention to thank. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a beef stew to make."
0,2017-12-20," Authorities worldwide are growing worried that Facebook, Google and Amazon are eroding privacy, using data to push rivals out of business and even affecting elections. This is one tech battle Apple can sit out. As a security-minded purveyor of hardware, it's likely to avoid the worst of the blowback. Europe will be the eye of the tech storm in 2018. The European Commission has already fined Google $2.8 billion for favoring its own services and burying rivals in search results. Regulators are deciding whether the Alphabet's Android mobile operating system gives it another means of unfairly promoting its businesses. A bigger fine and reduced mobile revenue from Google search could result. Fining Google for favoring its own products sets an unwelcome precedent for other tech firms. European Union authorities could forbid Amazon's listing of own-label products ahead of competitors' offerings. The biggest danger comes in May when companies must comply with Europe's General Data Protection Regulation. It requires that they seek explicit consent before using personal data. It's probable many customers will not agree, which means Google could find it harder to customize Gmail ads and Facebook might not be able to use WhatsApp information to sell ads on other sites and apps. Customers also have the right to delete their data or port it elsewhere — reducing the ability of Amazon and Google to lock in cloud customers. Parts of Europe's agenda may be adopted elsewhere. And lawmakers in the United States are mulling putting big internet firms under the oversight of the strict Federal Communications Commission, rather than the lax Federal Trade Commission. Apple is the biggest tech giant, worth nearly $900 billion, yet it stands curiously apart. The company sells lots of expensive phones, but it's no monopolist. The iPhone's combined share of the five biggest European markets is under 20 percent, says Kantar Worldpanel. The company also uses privacy as a selling point. It does not gather personal information to sell to advertisers, places similar restrictions on app developers and fights government attempts to unlock suspects' phones. Apple's inability to master social media means its business does not affect elections either. Apple is not carefree. The company's attempts to slither out of paying taxes make it a target in its own right. At worst, though, the result is probably a fine. Its rivals are looking at major, forced changes in their business models."
0,2017-12-23," I've long been under the spell of Harry Potter's wand. Not the one in the books or the movies, but the Chinese-made wands you can buy for $37.50 at Amazon, or $42.95 from harrypottershop.com. I first encountered the wand when I visited Universal Studios in Florida. I can't say much about the trip, because I felt somewhat concussed after a spin on the roller coaster that simulates Quidditch. I spent the ride with my eyes closed and hunched over. It was not a good look. A wand was purchased that day, and not long afterward an overenthusiastic young wizard cast a spell with a little too much elbow rotation. The wand snapped in half. Until then, I didn't believe much in magic, but examining the wand closely for the first time, I marveled that a such a thin reed of resin could require the heft of a credit card to own. As a business reporter, guessing the profit margins under the tree is a pastime of sorts, because there has to be more to the holidays than watching the Hallmark Channel. But it's not the easiest game. We live in an age when fidget spinners can cost more than $16,000. There was a period where I tithed much of my income to Pokémon cards. Legos once were so plentiful they lurked painfully underfoot in my house. Granted, the best toys are the ones that can spin gold from pennies. Of the 65 toys inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame in Rochester, N.Y., many are not all that complicated: The Slinky, Little Green Army Men, marbles and alphabet blocks. That said, the Hall of Fame itself should be viewed with a degree of suspicion. They have also inducted the stick, justifying it by saying it ""may be the world's oldest toy,"" and the cardboard box, explaining that ""children sensed the possibilities inherent in cardboard boxes, recycling them into innumerable playthings."" I'll keep that in mind. Cardboard boxes are not to be underestimated, actually. If you watch the many ""unboxing"" videos of Harry Potter wands on YouTube, the box gets significant airtime. One such review, which has been viewed more than 77,000 times, began with a close perusal of the box's ""dark red, maroonish color,"" the stickers that replicated the look of those from Ollivanders, the wand store in the books, movies and theme parks, and the ""red velvet squishy foam"" that the wand itself comes nestled in. Lesson learned: Packaging counts. So what are the highest profit margins in the toy business? Brand Finance, a brand consulting company based in London, pointed to Lego, putting its operating margins at 34 percent over the last half-decade, compared with 14 percent for Hasbro and 13 percent for Mattel. Gerrick Johnson, a toy analyst at BMO Capital Markets, named both Lego and Thomas & Friends, the maker of toy trains for little kids, which he said also had an operating profit margin in excess of 30 percent. ""Really, it's the brand and the brand quality,"" he said, adding that high sales volumes eased overhead costs. ""Parents feel good about letting their kids play with LEGO. There's a lot of play value (hours and hours of playtime),"" he added in an email. ""Thomas is similar. Wood connotes quality and education."" Toys aren't the easiest business, though. Even Lego, whose revival over the last decade came with a popular movie and adroit licensing deals, had a tough year. Toys 'R Us, once dominant, is wheezing. Harry's wand endures, though much is left to the imagination. Warner Brothers licenses the Harry Potter wands to other companies that produce and sell it. A Warner Brothers spokeswoman, in a brief phone interaction, went through a series of disclaimers involving what she was not going to say about sales and financial figures. ""I sound like I work for the C.I.A. right now,"" she said. The costs for the resin used to make most of the wands is pennies per pound. The main Harry Potter replica wand — one of 60 varieties produced by the Noble Collection, the largest licensee — has a weight measured in ounces. But there is also the tooling, labor and intellectual property to factor in, and the fact that some of the newer wands light up or have other features. When our wand broke mid-spell, we had already left the Florida theme park. But I course corrected, winding my way back to Ollivanders, conjuring with each step a Hermione-like list of reasons this product should be replaced. Brandishing the broken pieces at the counter, I had some things to say, but in the end I barely said a word. The kid at the register shrugged and handed me another for free, which was a keeper. They say the wand picks the wizard, but sometimes the wizard's dad has a role to play."
0,2017-12-26," INTUTO, Peru — Amadeo García García rushed upriver in his canoe, slipping into the hidden, booby-trapped camp where his brother Juan lay dying. Juan writhed in pain and shook uncontrollably as his fever rose, battling malaria. As Amadeo consoled him, the sick man muttered back in words that no one else on Earth still understood. Je'intavea', he said that sweltering day in 1999. I am so ill. The words were Taushiro. A mystery to linguists and anthropologists alike, the language was spoken by a tribe that vanished into the jungles of the Amazon basin in Peru generations ago, hoping to save itself from the invaders whose weapons and diseases had brought it to the brink of extinction. A bend on the ""wild river,"" as they called it, sheltered the two brothers and the other 15 remaining members of their tribe. The clan protected its tiny settlement with a ring of deep pits, expertly hidden by a thin cover of leaves and sticks. They kept packs of attack dogs to stop outsiders from coming near. Even by the end of the 20th century, few outsiders had ever seen the Taushiro or heard their language beyond the occasional hunter, a few Christian missionaries and the armed rubber tappers who came at least twice to enslave the small tribe. But in the end it was no use. Without rifles or medicine, they were dying off. A jaguar killed one of the children as he slept. Two more siblings, bitten by snakes, perished without antivenom. One child drowned in a stream. A young man bled to death while hunting in the forest. Then came the diseases. First measles, which took Juan and Amadeo's mother. Finally, a fatal form of malaria killed their father, the patriarch of the tribe. His body was buried in the floor of his home before the structure was torched to the ground, following Taushiro tradition. So by the time Amadeo wrestled his dying brother into the canoe that day, they were the only ones who remained, the last of a culture that once numbered in the thousands. Amadeo sped to a distant town, Intuto, that was home to a clinic. A crowd gathered on the small river dock to see who the dying stranger was, dressed only in a loincloth made of palm leaves. Juan's shaking soon gave way to stiffness. He drifted in and out of consciousness, finally looking up at Amadeo. Ta va'a ui, he said at last. I am dying. The church bell rang that afternoon, letting villagers know that the unusual visitor had died. ""The strange thing was how quiet Amadeo was,"" said Tomás Villalobos, a Christian missionary who was with him when Juan died. ""I asked him, 'How do you feel?' And he said to me: 'It's over now for us.'"" Amadeo said it haltingly, in broken Spanish, the only way he would be able to communicate with the world from that moment on. No one else spoke his language anymore. The survival of his culture had suddenly come down to a sole, complicated man. Human history can be traced through the spread of languages. The Phoenicians spanned the ancient Mediterranean trade routes, bringing the alphabet to the Greeks and literacy to Europeans. English, once a small language spoken in southern Britain, is now the mother tongue of hundreds of millions across the world. The Chinese dialects are more than a billion strong. But the entire fate of the Taushiro people now lies with its last speaker, a person who never expected such a burden and has spent much of his life overwhelmed by it. ""That's Amadeo there: Almost no one understands him when he's speaking his language,"" said William Manihuari, watching Amadeo fish alone from a canoe on a recent day. ""And when he dies, no one is left,"" added José Sandi, a 12-year-old boy who watched as well. The waters of the Peruvian Amazon were once a vast linguistic repository, a place where every turn of the river could yield another dialect, often completely unintelligible to people living just a few miles away. But in the last century, at least 37 languages have disappeared in Peru alone, lost in the steady clash and churn of national expansion, migration, urbanization and the pursuit of natural resources. Forty-seven languages remain here in Peru, scholars estimate, and nearly half are at risk of disappearing. I came to the river outpost of Intuto, 10 hours by speedboat from the nearest city, to figure out how the Taushiro, like so many other cultures, had been brought to this kind of end. The journey began in forgotten linguistic papers and historical sketches. It even led me to storm-ravaged Puerto Rico, where a retired Christian missionary rummaged through the last existing pictures of the Taushiro, nearly coming to tears as she looked through them for the first time in years. And it brought me here, to the banks of a silty brown river, where the cumulative experience of the Taushiro people swung alone in a hammock: A man around 70 whose memory was fading and whose grasp of the language was slipping away because he had no one to speak it with. ""At any moment I might disappear, my life will end, we don't know how soon,"" Amadeo said stoically. ""The Taushiro don't think about death. We just move on."" He knows that's not true, that there is no moving on for the Taushiro anymore. It leaves him exasperated, at times wondering how much of the blame is his, or whether the extinction of his people really matters at all. ""Sometimes I don't care anymore,"" he said. The Taushiro were among the world's last hunter-gathers, living as refugees in their own country, wandering the swamps of the Amazon basin with blow guns called pucuna and fishing from small boats called tenete. To count in their language, they had words only for the numbers one, two, three and many. And by the time Amadeo was born, their population had shrunk so drastically that they had no names in a traditional sense: Amadeo's father was simply  iya, or father, his mother iño, or mother, his sister and brother ukuka and ukuñuka. Languages are typically passed down through families, but Amadeo broke his apart decades before he realized what the consequences would be for his culture and its place in history. He still has five children, dotted across the Americas. But after his wife left him in the 1980s, he put them into an orphanage when they were still young, thinking it was safer than a life in which children were abducted by traffickers or lost to war. None of them lived with him after that. They never learned his language. ""For those languages that are in this critical situation, many times it seems their fate is already sealed — that's to say, it's hard to ever recover a language at this stage,"" said Agustín Panizo, a government linguist trying to document Taushiro. ""Amadeo García, he wants Taushiro to come back. He wants it, he dreams of it, he longs for it, and he suffers to know that he's the last speaker."" Now Amadeo lives alone in a clapboard house behind the town's water tower, spending many of his final days drinking. Desperate to speak and hear whatever Taushiro he can, he sits alone on his porch in the morning, reciting the only literature ever written in the language — verses of the Bible translated into Taushiro by missionaries who sought to convert the tribe years ago. Ine aconahive ite chi yi tua tieya ana na'que I'yo lo', he read aloud one morning. It was the story of Lot from the Book of Genesis. Lot and his family become the sole survivors of their city when God destroys Sodom and Gomorrah. Lot loses his wife when she looks back at the destruction, against the instructions of God. Amadeo lives alongside the people of Intuto, but not with them, often passing them in a quiet stupor. Mario Tapuy, 74, who met Amadeo as a child when he lived in the forest, said he had tried many times to draw Amadeo out of the bar to teach others the language. Mr. Tapuy, who speaks his own indigenous language, Kichwa, said he had realized years ago that the future of Taushiro would come to down to Amadeo, regardless of whether he wanted the responsibility. ""I told him many times,"" Mr. Tapuy said. ""He listens, but it doesn't record in his brain."" I had arrived in Intuto with a linguist named Juanita Pérez Ríos, who had known Amadeo for years and introduced me to him that day. In the evening, Amadeo wanted to speak to his son Daniel, who lives in Lima, the capital, and Ms. Pérez lent him her phone. It had been many months since the father and son had spoken. ""I fell on my knees in the jungle,"" said Amadeo. ""I'm limping a little."" ""You need to be careful,"" said Daniel. The two spoke in Spanish, which was sometimes difficult for Amadeo. ""My brothers told me you've been getting a little drunk,"" Daniel chided him. ""You need to stop that now."" Then a pause. ""I love you a lot, understand?"" said Daniel. The phone clicked. Amadeo sat in his home for a few minutes, looking into the night as the sounds of the forest grew louder. Families could be heard in the distance, cooking dinner. ""They say they love me, but they never come,"" he said. The problems began with rubber. The Taushiro and other indigenous groups had long harvested a sticky white substance that leaked from certain trees and coated their clothes, making them waterproof. But by the 19th century, Europeans had discovered the utility of rubber as well, setting off a boom. European and American companies descended into the jungles, forcing indigenous populations into slavery to tap the rubber while building huge palaces on the lands left behind. The deadly Age of Rubber had begun in the Amazon. In many areas, as much as 90 percent of the indigenous population died from disease and forced labor, researchers say. Thousands moved into newly settled cities. But the Taushiro, along with many other tribes, took another route: They decided to disappear. Amadeo's early memories from the hidden Taushiro settlement of Aucayacu remain in the haze of a place where writing was unknown and no records were kept, not even of his birth, which he thinks was sometime in the 1940s. His first memory was walking naked through the forest in a storm, the rain trickling down his body. Contact with the outside world was rare, and often violent. First came a rubber tapper in search of slaves. Wielding machetes and rifles, he found Aucayacu with four of his men and ordered the tribe to work. Amadeo and his family spent grueling days draining rubber from tree trunks and sculpting it into blocks to be sold by the trader downriver. The tapper forced Amadeo's married sister into a sexual relationship, then nearly beat her to death with a piece of wood. Her husband threw a spear through the tapper, who was never seen there again. Before long, another rubber tapper came in his place. Perhaps learning from the fate of his predecessor, the new tapper decided to give his rifle in exchange for work, rather than turn it against the Taushiro. He also gave them something else. Unable to distinguish among his workers, he lined them up and gave them Spanish names: Margarita, Andrés, Magdalena, César, Antonio. The youngest boy was called Amadeo. With no surnames, the Taushiro were each given two: García García. One day the ground began to tremble and the world took another step toward Amadeo. It wasn't an earthquake, but the seismic testing equipment of the Occidental Petroleum Corporation, an American company that had come to Peru. Rubber had long declined in the Amazon. Now the foreigners were after oil. Word spread among the drillers that an indigenous group was hiding on one of the tributaries of the Tigre River. Occidental soon sent a plane and a lookout with binoculars to locate the tribe. It was the first time Amadeo had seen anyone fly. It was 1971. ""They were so close to the ground you could see their faces looking at us,"" Amadeo said. With the coordinates of the Taushiro in hand, contact was inevitable. But rather than sending one of its own, the oil company turned to a group of Christian evangelists with an unusual mission. The Summer Institute of Linguistics had been founded four decades earlier by an evangelical minister who wanted to translate the Bible into every language still spoken. By the 1970s, the group had become a fixture in forests of Latin America, often under government contracts for literacy programs. Contact — followed by conversion — was the ultimate goal of the Christian linguists. The mission sometimes proved deadly. In 1956, after dropping gifts to the uncontacted Waorani people, five missionaries were speared to death by the tribe on a riverbank in Ecuador. Undeterred, the institute sent a sister of one of the dead missionaries to try once more with the Waorani, who let the outsider and her family live among them. The tribe converted. In 1971, Daniel Velie approached the edges of the Taushiro settlement, making his way past the booby traps and barking dogs. From the back of a canoe, he hauled out a heavy device to make the first recordings of their language. But the Taushiro were in no state to speak. An illness had swept through the village. When Mr. Velie arrived, seven Taushiro were near death. He pulled out a first-aid kit and gave them penicillin, the first antibiotics the Taushiro had taken. When they recovered, he took down the first 200 words of a Taushiro glossary. Using hand gestures, the group conveyed their appreciation to the missionary. But Mr. Velie wanted something in return. He eventually asked for Amadeo, who was thought to be in his 20s at the time, to return with him and start teaching the language to others. ""They said yes, Amadeo could go; they were so thankful to have been saved,"" said Nectali Alicea, the linguist soon put in charge of the Taushiro project by the language institute. ""It was medicine that was the key."" Ms. Alicea was a young Puerto Rican social sciences graduate. She had already embarked on missions to Mexico as part of her training with the institute, which taught her the structures of languages at its annual summer boot camp in Oklahoma. For Ms. Alicea, as with many of the missionaries, the languages were a bridge to Christianity. ""You cannot evangelize in Spanish,"" she said. One of her pictures from 1972 shows Amadeo stepping aboard a plane for the first time, en route to the institute's compound outside the Peruvian city of Pucallpa. A new world of firsts was opening up: of roads and sidewalks, of chicken, which he had never eaten before. He slept on the floor, unaccustomed to a bed. For days on end, Ms. Alicea took dictations of his language to prepare to meet the Taushiro in the forest. She arrived at their secret camp that June with a missionary doctor from Georgia, his wife and their son for a two-week visit. The Taushiro clan welcomed the strangers and the recording technology they brought, along with medicine, machetes and food. ""The father would embrace me and not let me go,"" Ms. Alicea wrote in her diary of one of the Taushiro men. ""I would forget my land and stay here, he said."" She began to follow some of their conversations, learning enough Taushiro to ask one man in the clan why he never swam. Despite living off the river, the Taushiro avoided even wading in it, washing themselves from the safety of a canoe. The man explained that under the water lurked a horde of boa constrictors, waiting to strike. Ms. Alicea and the missionaries with her stripped down to their underwear and jumped into the river, laughing and splashing. ""When they saw us in the water, something changed,"" Ms. Alicea said, adding that the event had caused the Taushiro to question their long-held beliefs. ""They asked us how we did it. And we said: 'Because we have a Spirit that is stronger than the boa.'"" Ms. Alicea produced a Bible. Years before, the Taushiro had taken Christian names. Now they were taking on Christianity itself. When Amadeo, the youngest of the Taushiro, arrived with a girl named Margarita Machoa, declaring that she would be his wife, there was a sigh of relief in Aucayacu. The Taushiro line was continuing. ""She fell in love with me,"" said Amadeo, recalling how he and Margarita had played with her toy dolls after meeting. Amadeo was a grown man. Margarita was 12 years old. Amadeo soon wound up in jail, arrested at the request of the girl's father. He said Margarita was too young to give Amadeo her consent. In the end, it was Ms. Alicea, the linguist, who brokered Amadeo's release, arguing that Peruvian law allowed indigenous men to marry according to their customs. Converting the clan to Christianity was possible, Ms. Alicea felt, but the changes could go only so far. ""It was typical among natives; I had seen this with Candoshi, with the Sharpras people,"" Ms. Alicea said. ""They had such small girls with the oldest men. At least this was better."" Within months, Margarita was pregnant with Amadeo's first child, a girl they named Margarita. The baby was the first of five. Amadeo and Ms. Alicea continued their work recording the Taushiro language, fighting pressure from the missionaries to move onto other groups. Amadeo had given Ms. Alicea a Taushiro name, ukuka, or sister, and she called him ukuañuka, or younger brother, in return. During the birth of his last son, also named Amadeo, Ms. Alicea cut the umbilical cord by the side of the river. The two were becoming inseparable, working long hours to document Taushiro words. ""She would ask, 'What is this called?'"" Amadeo recalled. ""'How do you say nail? How do you say toe?'"" Amadeo taught his children the ways of the clan, particularly David, Daniel and Jonathan, who were becoming quick with blow guns and spears. On early mornings, he took them to gather the palm leaves they had left near termites' nests the day before. The leaves were covered in insects — bait for fishing, a technique the Taushiro had used for generations. Yet the dangers of the forest were always present. ""My father would say before we went to sleep, 'Remember, a tiger can come for you,'"" Jonathan said, using a common word for jaguars. Taushiro culture, especially its language, proved isolating for Amadeo's wife, Margarita, who came from a different tribe and was unable to communicate with anyone in Taushiro. She couldn't even speak with her own husband, except in broken Spanish. She spent long days alone with her children, sometimes screaming at them or giving them beatings in frustration. ""Since she was married young, she wasn't grown up,"" said her daughter, also named Margarita, who remembers being thrown out of a canoe by her mother when the girl could barely swim. ""It's not the same to play with a doll as it was to play with flesh and bones."" In 1984, after their fifth child was born, Amadeo took the family to a village where he worked construction for several months. Neighbors said the couple argued frequently. They could hear Margarita's screams when Amadeo beat her. Margarita, her daughter said, had gotten into a relationship with a man her own age. When Amadeo learned of it, he attacked her again. It was the last beating she took from him. ""She left that night and said nothing,"" the daughter said. Their mother's sudden departure devastated the family. Without her, Amadeo became the sole caretaker of five children. The division of labor between the genders had been strict among the Taushiro, with men spending the day hunting for food and women raising the children. ""I knew nothing about how to care for them,"" Amadeo said. With his relatives in Aucayacu dwindling from old age and disease, Amadeo decided to leave the camp for the missionary compound near Pucallpa, several hundred miles away. His children, he didn't realize at the time, were leaving the forest for good. In the city, Amadeo sank into despair — and into alcoholism. In town, liquor was suddenly available. ""He got drunk, he insulted people,"" said Mario Tapuy Paredes, a friend at the time. Still, Amadeo held onto the project that had anchored most of his adult life, documenting Taushiro with the missionaries. He and Ms. Alicea had moved beyond a basic dictionary and grammar books into the first translations of the Bible, including parts of Genesis and sections of New Testament books like the Gospels. But for the language to survive beyond books, it needed to be taken on by Amadeo's children. And it was becoming unclear whether he could keep them safe, let alone teach them Taushiro. One day when Amadeo was out of the house, Margarita, then 9, was approached by a woman offering her food. She followed the woman to a taxi, which sped away with her. Ms. Alicea called the police, who rescued the girl from a boat launch where her abductor had planned to put her into a child trafficking ring. The abduction shook Amadeo. Feeling overwhelmed, he eventually decided to put the children into an orphanage. It was a lonely and troubling time for them. But in 1989, a social worker came to Ms. Alicea with a request. With 40 children, the orphanage was overextended, and Peru's Maoist rebels, the Shining Path, were staging massacres in nearby cities. Could Ms. Alicea, the orphanage asked, adopt the Taushiro children herself? Ms. Alicea, then in her 50s, would now become the mother of the world's last five Taushiro children. There was an obstacle, however. Her own mother, in her 70s, was growing ill in Puerto Rico. Ms. Alicea wanted to return to care for her. This confronted the linguist with the most difficult choice of her career: to save the Taushiro language and culture, or to save the children she had known since their birth and grown to love. The contradictions were lost on no one. First Amadeo, one of the last of his people, who had spent his adult life trying to ensure that his language endured, had given up his own children, virtually guaranteeing that they would never pass it along. Then Ms. Alicea, who had devoted herself for nearly two decades to documenting and preserving the Taushiro way of life, was taking its few remaining descendants to a distant country, to be raised in an entirely different culture that would effectively erase their own. ""I was Christian first,"" she said, explaining that her principal duty was to the welfare of the children. Ms. Alicea's decision to move the children to Puerto Rico remains a shock to linguists who know of Taushiro, arguing that her choice all but guaranteed its extinction. ""I have never heard of an equivalent story elsewhere; in any academic circle, that would have been considered an unethical event,"" said Zachary O'Hagan, a Ph.D. student in linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley who has done research with Amadeo in Peru. ""When a language like this disappears, you have lost a key data point in studying what universal properties exist in all languages,"" Mr. O'Hagan said. But Ms. Alicea said it was unlikely that Amadeo would have ever taught his children Taushiro under the circumstances. And she said that, at the time, she did not envision a future in which Amadeo would become the last of his tribe. In 1990, she adopted the children and changed their last names to her own. The family moved across the hemisphere. ""I love the language,"" Ms. Alicea said. ""But I love the people more than the language. With the blessing of God, those children had a future."" The change was staggering for the children. They had been born in an isolated tribe in the Amazon and abandoned in an orphanage. Suddenly, they were transported to a commonwealth of the United States, with busy streets that came to a halt at rush hour and high rises in San Juan. The thump of nightclub music stretched into the night. They saw the Caribbean for the first time. Ms. Alicea became their guide to the new world, taking them on vacations to New York. Her photos from the early 1990s show the Taushiro children playing in the snow. The adjustment differed for each of the children as they settled into San Lorenzo, Ms. Alicea's home in the center of the island. Margarita, the most extroverted of the children, made new friends quickly. Amadeo Jr., the youngest at 6, picked up a Puerto Rican accent. But his indigenous features were a curiosity to his classmates. Rather than say he was Taushiro, he told his friends his father was Japanese. David was the first one to run into trouble. As the years passed, he became angry. By seventh grade, his teachers feared his outbursts. Ms. Alicea began to notice money missing from her wallet. One night, Ms. Alicea confronted him in the living room. It led to an altercation that ended with her calling the police. ""I want you to decide if you want to stay here, if you want to be American or Peruvian,"" she recalled telling him. ""I love him and still do."" Two of the brothers, Jonathan and Daniel, decided to return to their father. The years alone had been difficult for Amadeo. Increasingly drawn to alcohol, which was available only in towns, Amadeo settled in Intuto and lived as a recluse, still sleeping on the ground as he had in Aucayacu. He now hunted with a rifle instead of a blowgun, heading into the forest most days in search of game to sell. ""When we were out, he camped alone,"" recalled Jorge Choclón, who sometimes hunted with Amadeo. ""That was his way. And he didn't like society."" But waiting on the dock in 1994 for the arrival of Jonathan and Daniel, Amadeo was filled with hope again. The father and sons, reunited, embraced. While they could not speak the language, Amadeo was eager to bring his sons back into the traditions of their people. He and Jonathan woke at 5 a.m. for the hunt, returning after sundown. He took the boys to what remained of the Taushiro settlement in Aucayacu, where only his father and a few relatives still survived. Jonathan felt apart from it, unable to communicate with anyone there. ""My grandfather could only say my name,"" he recalled. ""I had gotten used to Puerto Rico. Now I felt more from there. I cried all night."" The opportunity to learn Taushiro seemed lost. The boys were teenagers, past the age when children usually pick up language quickly from their parents. Spanish was still the language they heard at school most of the day, and a stigma lingered in Intuto when it came to indigenous languages. ""I could barely say a few words — mother, father, that was it,"" Jonathan said. The arrival of David, the oldest brother, in 1996 brought new challenges. Mr. Villalobos, the Christian missionary who directed the school in Intuto, said David's anger had followed him to Peru. The boy rarely did his schoolwork and was known for carrying a knife around town, once threatening to stab one of his classmates, Mr. Villalobos said. And Amadeo's drinking continued. One day, José Álvarez, a missionary, went to visit Amadeo at his home on the edge of town. In Spanish, Amadeo told him he was sick, but after a moment Mr. Álvarez said he realized Amadeo was trying to say he was depressed, unable to find the correct word. Amadeo began to cry, the first time Mr. Álvarez had ever seen him express emotion. ""He spoke in tears of his children, that they didn't want to come see him, that they didn't want to know hardly anything of him, or their Taushiro origins, not the language, not the culture,"" Mr. Álvarez wrote in a letter from that time. Mr. Álvarez added: ""I felt in these moments the deep pain that probably that man felt, the last Taushiro, that the saga of his people would definitively end with him."" The Taushiro language had been reduced to its last five speakers: Amadeo, and four family members who desperately held onto life in their encampment in Aucayacu. And even that meager number was about to collapse. The first to die was a brother of Amadeo's who had long been unable to walk, paralyzed years ago after a snake bite. Then Amadeo's aunt woke up one day with a sore throat, a fever and blotchy rashes across her body, the first signs of measles. The missionaries had left the encampment years ago, and she died without treatment. Then came malaria. In the late 1990s, a deadly strain began to work its way up the rivers of northern Peru. Amadeo's father fell ill and died. Now only Juan, Amadeo's last brother, remained, living alone in the ruins of the settlement where he had grown up, with only dogs for company. In 1999, Amadeo hauled his dying brother from the canoe, and the two spoke in Taushiro for the last time. ""They said, 'Don't cry, your brother is with the Lord,'"" recalled Amadeo. Nearly 20 years later, Amadeo walked through an overgrown cemetery, the place he had buried his brother. The wooden cross had fallen over. Juan García's name was barely visible where it had been etched onto one of the beams. ""When I'm gone, I'll be here as well,"" Amadeo said later that day. ""I am old and will disappear at any time."" Yet even in the twilight of Amadeo's life, a few hold out hope that some part of the Taushiro language will persist after him. This year, Peru's Ministry of Culture decided to take up the work that Ms. Alicea began. Working with Amadeo, government linguists have created a database of 1,500 Taushiro words, 27 stories and three songs, with plans to make recordings of Amadeo available to academics and others interested in the language. It is a race against time — and against Amadeo's own memory, which sometimes fails him after so many years of having no one to speak with in Taushiro. But linguists involved in the work say that even if Taushiro dies with Amadeo, a record of it will be kept, at least. ""It's the first time that Peru has made this kind of gesture,"" said Mr. Panizo, the linguist leading the project. Last February, the government flew Amadeo to Lima to give him a medal for his contribution to Peruvian culture. The sudden attention was a shock to Amadeo, along with the packed streets of Lima and the interviews with the local news media. Still, he beamed as a crowd gathered for a ceremony that honored several other indigenous activists who spoke their languages. Government officials gave impassioned speeches on the importance of preserving the 47 indigenous languages that remain in the country. Amadeo spoke words in Taushiro. While Amadeo knew that he had not passed his language to his five children, he took comfort in the fact that they were safe. They had not suffered the fate of their relatives, who had all perished in the forest. One of them, Daniel, was even in the audience that day to see him. After the ceremony, the two men embraced. Daniel introduced Amadeo to his 6-year-old daughter, the first time Amadeo had met his grandchild. ""I just want to be proud of my father, of the tribe that we were, that I was born into, that we lived,"" said Daniel, who works as a construction worker in Lima. One evening this summer, Amadeo sat alone and began to speak his language, saying one sentence in Taushiro, then translating it into Spanish, before repeating the process. It was growing late, the crickets and frogs were getting louder, and Amadeo raised his voice above them. ""I am Taushiro,"" he said. ""I have something that no one else in the world has. One day when I am gone from the world, I hope the world remembers."""
