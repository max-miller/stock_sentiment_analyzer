1,2018-01-02," Please take your seats. It is that time of year again: our annual closing dinner, where we look back at the year that was, to toast and roast the year's deal makers on Wall Street and in Washington and look ahead to what may come next. And what a year it was. This year, we decided to hold our dinner at the Breakers in Palm Beach, Fla., just down the road from the Mar-a-Lago resort, better known as the Winter White House. Given that President Trump has spent nearly a third of his presidency — that's not a typo — at one of his properties, as The Wall Street Journal reported, we figured we would try to make it convenient for him. There were a surprising number of free openings at Mar-a-Lago given all the cancellations by foundations and charities, but ever since an artist projected ""Pay Trump Bribes Here"" on the Trump International Hotel in Washington, our conflicts committee suggested that hosting the dinner at Mar-a-Lago would be a bad idea. We also figured holding the dinner in Florida would be convenient for so many of you moguls and machers already down here looking for real estate since the tax bill was signed into law. The other bonus of buying here, of course, is that your home is protected even if you file for bankruptcy. Sitting at the dais are Mr. Trump along with the first lady. (Ivanka, Jared and the rest of the family were away on vacation.) Next to him are Rupert Murdoch and his new B.F.F., Robert Iger of the Walt Disney Company, who just gave up any hope of running for president in 2020, a condition of his deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox's assets. To their right are the chief negotiators for the tax plan: Gary Cohn and Steven Mnuchin (and Ms. Mnuchin's wife, Louise Linton, who I should mention — and I'll be sure to hashtag this on Instagram — is wearing a beautiful scarf from Hermes and gown by Valentino). The seating chart is, of course, always a bit complicated. We had to keep Jeffrey Bezos of Amazon from the dais to prevent Mr. Trump's Twitter war with him from interrupting the festivities. And we had heard that Mr. Bezos had a practical joke planned: He was going to tell Mr. Trump that he had chosen Mexico City as Amazon's second headquarters. Masayoshi Son, SoftBank's founder, is also here this year. He is seated at the Uber table, having just struck a deal to invest $9 billion in the company at a 30 percent discount to the company's previous valuation of $68 billion, although he had also invested $1 billion at the company's previous valuation to maintain the fiction that the company was still worth $68 billion. It's been a tough year at the Uber table of frenemies: Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber's new chief executive; Travis Kalanick, Uber's founder; Arianna Huffington, an Uber board member; and Bill Gurley, one of Uber's largest investors. To help keep the peace, we've invited a calming influence to sit with them: Anthony Scaramucci, the Mooch, who had his own tough year as the president's director of communications for a hot minute. We had extended an invitation to Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, but our invitation was returned. When we tried to call him at the Ritz Carlton in Riyadh, otherwise known as the Royal Prison, we were told, ""The hotel telephone lines are currently disconnected until further notice."" (By the way, that's not a joke.) And then there is the Facebook table: Mark Zuckerberg is here this year along with Sheryl Sandberg. We're sorry to say that Vladimir Putin could not make it. I jest! Sort of. Finally, we have the Bitcoin table: The Winklevoss twins, newly minted as Bitcoin billionaires (cut out the gloating and spitballs to the Facebook table, please) and Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, who has said Bitcoin mania is ""worse than tulip bulbs,"" adding: ""It won't end well. Someone is going to get killed."" We'd love to hear the dinner conversation among you all. Now, on to the toasts of 2017. DEAL OF THE YEAR Amazon.com's acquisition of Whole Foods came as a true surprise. The deal has the potential to truly accelerate Amazon's march into our daily lives by giving it an even closer distribution point to our homes. It also was a signal to the rest of the marketplace that nothing is off limits. The betting line is that the next land grab for Amazon is pharmaceuticals, which may have driven CVS's $68 billion bid for Aetna. Also, a postscript: One deal that has not received enough credit but that proved itself in 2017 was Walmart's acquisition of Jet.com. The $3.3 billion acquisition of a money-losing site seemed like a mistake, but has breathed new life into Walmart's e-commerce business. SURPRISE I.P.O. SUCCESS Roku, the streaming television company, went public, and its stock is up 280 percent, one of the highest increases of the year. The company is being compared to Netflix and is considered a pure-play bet on over-the-top streaming television services.  A SIGN OF THE TOP? Blue Apron, a meal kit service, went public and quickly fell faster than Pets.com. Who thought that was a good idea? TRUMP WINNERS Stock investors were some of the biggest beneficiaries in 2017, with a rally that began when Mr. Trump won the presidency. On an individual basis, Stephen A. Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group gambled early and publicly on Mr. Trump, despite protests inside and outside his firm. It gave him a ringside seat to the White House last year. Saudi Arabia backed a new $40 billion infrastructure fund by the firm. And Mr. Schwarzman, like the entire private equity industry, was a beneficiary of the new tax plan, which kept carried interest taxed at capital gains rates with only a slight adjustment. MORAL C.E.O. WINNER Kenneth C. Frazier of Merck was the first chief executive on one of Mr. Trump's councils to rebuke the president's comments after violence in Charlottesville, Va. A wave of executives followed suit, but only after Mr. Frazier made the first move. That took real courage. TWITTER C.E.O. WINNER Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs won Twitter in 2017 with this witty tweet during the solar eclipse: ""Wish the moon wasn't the only thing casting a shadow across the country. We got through one, we'll get through the other."" ENTREPRENEUR OF THE YEAR Say what you will about Elon Musk — he has fans and critics — but he again proved that he thinks differently. Sure, he introduced new Teslas and sent more rockets into space. But he also introduced perhaps his craziest idea: the Boring Company. Technically, he founded the company in December 2016, but it was during 2017 that we really learned about his ambitions: He wants to dig huge tunnels under the earth to create a patchwork of roadways. The economics and physics of it all have been questioned. But as a venture capitalist, Jason Calacanis, said this summer: ""Betting against Elon Musk is betting against the future of humanity, and it's an incredibly stupid thing to do."" THANK YOU OF THE YEAR Janet Yellen, the departing Federal Reserve chairwoman, deserves our genuine thanks for steering the economy successfully and overseeing a drop in the unemployment rate to levels not seen in decades. She took verbal abuse from our president, who called her ""obviously political"" before he was elected, only for him to double back and praise her once he realized that his economy was her economy, too. MOST IMPORTANT CHANGE IN BUSINESS The exposure of bad behavior by men toward women in the workplace — and elsewhere — throughout virtually all industries was perhaps the most important and profound story of the year. It has already shaken up a multitude of businesses, and more revelations are likely to come. Its impact on our culture and office politics will last far longer, hopefully, than anything else discussed at tonight's dinner.  QUESTION OF THE YEAR Why does the administration really want to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal? Of course, the speculation in media circles is it has to do with Mr. Trump's war on CNN. That may or may not be true. But the president didn't help himself when Sarah Huckabee Sanders quoted him as saying he supported a rival merger between Mr. Murdoch and Disney, saying that ""this could be a great thing for jobs"" when it plainly will result in layoffs."
2,2018-01-02," The golden age of television programming is heading for a grisly finale. Netflix, Amazon, Apple and Hulu are on course to increase their spending on new shows and movies at a faster clip than the growth of the overall video-streaming market. Consolidation among traditional media groups is only adding to the frenzy. Something will have to give. Netflix set off the arms race. In 2017, the company, founded by Reed Hastings, directed $6 billion toward licensing and original series like ""Stranger Things."" In 2018, executives plan to earmark up to $8 billion for content, a 33 percent increase. Across the industry, the number of original television shows more than doubled from 2010 to 2016, to 455, according to the research firm MoffettNathanson. Total spending on content by the big four media upstarts in 2018 will mushroom some 30 percent, year over year, to $18 billion, according to a Breakingviews forecast based on analysts' estimates. Yet the entire global video-streaming market is expected to increase 16 percent to about $21 billion, according to PwC. That means there has never been a better time to be a couch potato, but it's glum news for the companies. The tangle of options in streaming services and programming, chasing a finite number of subscribers, suggests the industry is entering an unsustainable investment battle — and a price war may follow as players try to rake in extra market share. Netflix looks like a survivor. It was the first mover in video streaming a decade ago and has 100 million global customers. The snag is that it is burning cash — up to $2.5 billion in 2017. Apple and Amazon could easily outmatch Netflix on content budgets if they decided to abandon financial reason. Amazon, for instance, coughed up $250 million for rights to the ""Lord of the Rings"" TV series, according to a report in Deadline Hollywood. Facebook and Alphabet's YouTube are lurking in the shadows, but that could change. Hulu, with its hydra-headed ownership split among 21st Century Fox, Comcast, Walt Disney and Time Warner, is in a weaker position. Its owners are separately planning their own direct-to-consumer products, adding to the competition. Then there is the possibility of consolidation as media firms bulk up their own content to feed their services. In the latest example, Disney has agreed to buy some of Fox, including its stake in Hulu, for $52 billion. The result is too many characters chasing not enough action."
0,2018-01-03," Three related species of manakins occupy adjacent parcels of the Amazon rain forest: Opal-crowned, snow-capped and golden-crowned. They are all plump like sparrows, small enough to cup in a hand and have radiant yellow-green upper bodies with golden undersides. Biologists are now unlocking the mystery of how these neighboring birds became distinct species. Last week, a team of scientists confirmed in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that the golden-crowned manakin is a unique hybrid species that emerged from a cross between the opal-crowned and snow-capped manakins about 180,000 years ago. Though one-off mating events between different species occur across the animal kingdom — think pizzly bears, occasional crosses between polar and grizzly bears — the establishment of an entirely separate hybrid species is thought to be relatively rare. For a new species to occur, it has to become reproductively isolated, or form a stable population that no longer freely mixes with its parent species, said Alfredo Barrera-Guzmán, who led the new research as a doctoral student at the University of Toronto Scarborough. Opal-crowned manakins wear an iridescent toupee, evocative of a unicorn's mane. Snow-capped manakins are topped with bright glacial patches. And members of the hybrid species, the golden-crowned manakin, display a burst of yellow to match their bellies. Choosy females prefer the particular color sported by males of their own species, leading to reproductive isolation. Hybrids often look like an intermediate between their parent species, which made scientists skeptical that you'd get a golden-crowned manakin by crossing opal-crowned and snow-capped manakins. To settle the mystery, Dr. Barrera-Guzmán and his colleagues sequenced much of the golden-crowned manakin's genome and confirmed that it has a blend of DNA from the other two species. The scientists then examined feathers from the heads of golden-crowned males under an electron microscope. They found that the manakin's warm crown comes from pigments called carotenoids, which the birds get from their diet. When chemically stripped of these pigments, the feathers turned grayish-white. Dr. Barrera-Guzmán's team suspects that the first male mixes between snow-capped and opal-crowned manakins bore this dull tuft, an intermediate between the white and iridescent caps of their forebears. During the last ice age, the Amazon rain forest shrunk and possibly cut some hybrids off from their parent species — the golden-crowned manakin's habitat today is separated from snow-capped and opal-crowned territories by rivers and mountains. As the hybrids evolved in this segregated space, females may have preferred to mate with males that had a higher concentration of carotenoids in their crown, producing an attractive yellow blaze, said Jason Weir, an associate professor of evolutionary biology at the University of Toronto Scarborough and senior author of the new paper. Hybridization is sometimes seen as reducing biodiversity, because it can merge distinct species together. But as genetic sequencing improves, scientists will likely discover more instances of hybridization generating new life-forms. Just this fall, scientists announced the discovery of a hybrid finch in the Galápagos that is in the process of becoming a new species. ""Hybridization is a double-edged sword,"" Dr. Weir said. ""It can erode diversity, but it can also be a creative force."" In the case of the golden-crowned manakin, it even created a new head of gold."
0,2018-01-05," When filmmakers and TV showrunners want to drop viewers into a paranoid but all-too-believable future, they return again and again to the same material: the dozens of novels and stories by the science fiction writer Philip K. Dick. From ""Blade Runner"" (1982), inspired by the 1968 novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?,"" to Amazon's ""The Man in the High Castle,"" based on the 1962 novel of the same name, the adaptations reveal Dick's stories to be endlessly adaptable tales for modern-day concerns: privacy, corporate control, free will and what it means to be human. Now Amazon, in partnership with Channel 4 in Britain and Sony Pictures Television, has found perhaps the most natural form to tackle the prolific writer's catalog: ""Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams,"" a 10-episode anthology show that adapts the writer's short stories for the first time on TV. (All 10 will be made available to Amazon Prime subscribers on Jan. 12.) The timing couldn't be better. Not only does the series grapple with questions evermore relevant in our increasingly technologically augmented times, but it is tailor-made for a format that's helped TV enter a new golden age. In the seven years since Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk created ""American Horror Story,"" with completely different story lines and characters each season, anthology shows have become home to some of the most ambitious and creative storytelling on TV. With ""Electric Dreams"" the format takes its next evolutionary step, with a new story and creative team for each episode. The approach is unlike that of ""American Horror Story"" or FX's other major anthology success, Noah Hawley's ""Fargo,"" where stories unwind over an entire season. And it differs from shows like HBO's ""Room 104,"" where the stories and cast change every episode but all are driven by the distinct auteur sensibility of the Duplass Brothers (the show's creators), which lends a tonal seamlessness from week to week. By contrast, the ""Electric Dreams"" creative teams, which include veterans of ""The Night Manager,"" ""Stranger Things"" and the Harry Potter universe, were given free rein by the showrunner, Michael Dinner, to veer wildly from episode to episode, from satirical to earnest to deeply, psychedelically strange. ""Everyone is trying to do original things to stand out, so you're not boxed into a format anymore,"" said one of the executive producers, Ronald D. Moore, who is best known for creating the acclaimed 2004 ""Battlestar Galactica"" reboot. If ""Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams"" is directly challenging any show, though, it's Netflix's technology-run-amok series ""Black Mirror,"" which is now in its fourth season. Both owe a major debt to an earlier wave of anthology programming, particularly turn-of-the-'60s series like ""Playhouse 90,"" ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents,"" and, especially, ""The Twilight Zone."" ""In some ways we had to talk to about 'Twilight Zone' in order to not copy it,"" Mr. Moore said. ""We'd say, well 'Twilight Zone' did this, let's do something else."" There are some clear advantages to the anthology format. For one, shows can be written in satisfying movie-like arcs, rather than the open-ended storytelling that traditional TV requires. And major stars are much more willing to sign on for a single season, or in the case of ""Electric Dreams,"" a single episode. ""We had so many actors who were interested because of that,"" Mr. Moore said. ""It was like, 'Oh, I can come in for five days and get it done?' That's a very appealing prospect."" The actors attracted to the series included Bryan Cranston of ""Breaking Bad"" (also one of the show's executive producers), Steve Buscemi, Maura Tierney and the avant-R&B singer Janelle Monáe. And ""Electric Dreams"" attracted writers and directors like Dee Rees (""Mudbound""), Peter Horton (""American Odyssey,"" ""Thirtysomething"") and Alan Taylor (""Game of Thrones""). Dick's daughter, Isa Dick Hackett, whose production company Electric Shepherd oversees adaptations of her father's work, reached out in 2012 to Mr. Dinner, executive producer of FX's ""Justified,"" and invited him to look at the short stories. ""Michael really had the idea to do it as anthology,"" said Mr. Moore, a friend of Mr. Dinner's who was brought on soon after. Mr. Dinner, who had a deal with Sony, also recruited Mr. Cranston, who, like the others, is a major Philip K. Dick fan. All four brought in people they'd worked with as well as reaching out to talent they admired. ""I sent Janelle Monáe a letter and asked her if she'd want to be a part of it,"" Ms. Hackett said. ""I knew that she was a big fan of my dad's."" Episodes include ""The Commuter,"" starring Timothy Spall, about a mysterious British town that doesn't appear on any maps, and Mr. Cranston's ""Human Is,"" which ponders whether it's better to be married to a to a total jerk or an attentive guy who happens to be bodysnatched by an alien. Mr. Moore wrote the episode ""Real Life,"" which stars Terrence Howard and Anna Paquin and deals with virtual reality. And Ms. Monáe plays an android who falls in with a band of post-apocalyptic survivors in her episode, ""Autofac."" But the show's creative freedom came at a cost in terms of complexity and difficulty for the producers. Scheduling and delivery pressures required two concurrent full-scale productions in London and Chicago. Each episode needed new sets, costumes, locations, casts and more. ""It's backbreaking,"" Mr. Moore said. ""None of us knew how much more expensive and time-consuming this would be than a typical show."" It's a little hard to believe now, but during his lifetime Dick was a fringe figure, even in science fiction circles. ""I don't think he would ever have imagined that 'Jeopardy' would have a Philip K. Dick category,"" Ms. Hackett said of her father. And what would he have made of a TV series based on his work, hosted on a newfangled thing called a streaming service that is available to watch at any time and on all sorts of devices? ""The way that he felt about his work being adapted is ambivalent,"" she said. ""But I think he would love that every person that took this on did it because they love his work and wanted to do their version of P.K.D. There's love all over it."""
1,2018-01-05," There's a lot to look forward to, or at least be curious about, on television and streaming this winter. New series will arrive starring Anna Paquin (WGN's ""Bellevue""), Sean Bean (""The Oath"" on Crackle) and Tim Robbins and Holly Hunter (HBO's ""Here and Now""). ""UnReal"" on Lifetime and ""Strike Back"" on Cinemax return after long hiatuses. High-profile projects like ""The Alienist"" on TNT, ""Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams"" on Amazon, ""The Looming Tower"" on Hulu and ""The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story"" on FX are generating their own buzz. And favorites like AMC's ""The Walking Dead,"" PBS's ""Call the Midwife,"" Showtime's ""Homeland"" and IFC's ""Portlandia"" (in its final season) promise to bring happiness to their fans. All that plus this very abbreviated list of particular highlights. 'DETECTORISTS' In its final season, this most wistful of comedies homes in on the essentials. Will the metal detectorists Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook) break through their passive-aggressive armor and not hopelessly fumble their love lives? And in one of the most quietly suspenseful story lines on TV, will they find their white whale, the Roman hoard they're convinced is buried in a local field? Answers are provided at the hands of the show's peerless cast, including Rachael Stirling, Diana Rigg, Rebecca Callard, Sophie Thompson, Mr. Crook and the endlessly expressive Mr. Jones. (Acorn TV, Jan. 15) 'HIGH MAINTENANCE' The comedy that gets the pretensions and anxieties of certain precincts of 21st-century Brooklyn just right opens its second season on HBO with a typically clever episode. The borough reacts with dismay to an unspecified but horrific event that immediately increases demand for the weed guy's product. (HBO, Jan. 19) 'PLANET EARTH: BLUE PLANET II' The further underwater adventures of David Attenborough, the manager of nature's Instagram account. Coming 17 years after the original ""Blue Planet,"" this seven-episode follow-up puts a greater emphasis on man-made threats to the world's oceans, but the spectacular, voyeuristic images are as purely pleasurable as ever. (BBC America, Jan. 20) 'COUNTERPART' Two types of thrillers — the paranoid Cold War and the dystopian science-fiction varieties — are overlaid in this nifty series, which posits alternate earths that intersect in a Berlin basement. The premise is explored in reasonably plausible ways, but the real incentive to watch is J. K. Simmons, who plays two roles: a gentle paper pusher in one world and a cynical tough guy in the other. It's as if the Simmons of ""Growing Up Fisher"" met the Simmons of ""Oz."" Eventually, of course, the two men have to impersonate each other, at which point it's Simmons squared, which is pretty hard to beat. (Starz, Jan. 21) '2 DOPE QUEENS' Phoebe Robinson and Jessica Williams's popular live podcast gets a four-episode TV run, directed by Tig Notaro and filmed at the Kings Theater in Brooklyn. Each episode has a theme and a star guest, including ""New York"" with Jon Stewart, ""Hot Peen"" with Tituss Burgess and ""Black Nerds"" with Uzo Aduba. (HBO, Feb. 2) 'ALTERED CARBON' Joel Kinnaman headlines a series for the first time since ""The Killing,"" so this cyberpunk crime thriller — set in a future when your consciousness can be stored on a disk and downloaded into any available body — is, by default, worth checking out. (Netflix, Feb. 2) 'THIS CLOSE' The deaf actors Josh Feldman and Shoshannah Stern wrote and star in this sharp, charming lo-fi dramedy about a pair of best friends, a blocked gay writer and a professionally stymied publicist. (Watching the two argue furiously, obscenely and silently in front of the uncomprehending nondeaf never gets old.) Based on a series of shorts shown at last year's Sundance Film Festival, it's directed by Andrew Ahn (""Spa Night"") and also features Zach Gilford, Keiko Agena and Cheryl Hines. (Sundance Now, Feb. 14) 'TELL THEM WE ARE RISING: THE STORY OF BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES' The documentarian Stanley Nelson's latest examination of African-American culture, being shown as part of PBS's ""Independent Lens"" series, is a brisk, absorbing and revelatory history of historically black colleges. (PBS, Feb. 19) 'THE AMERICANS' It's the end game for the Soviet spies Elizabeth and Philip Jennings — 10 final episodes before we know their fate. Season 6 jumps ahead to 1987, two years before the fall of the Berlin Wall and four before the end of the Soviet Union. Philip is out of the game, prospering in the travel business and cheering on their son's hockey team, while Elizabeth is in deeper than ever. The show may have lost some of the nerve-stretching excitement of its early seasons, but Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys still make Elizabeth and Philip indelibly real. (FX, March) 'HARD SUN' Neil Cross, the creator of ""Luther,"" wants every minute of a show to feel like the end of the world, and he'll leap past all bounds of plausibility and sound dramatic construction to make it happen. He's at it again in ""Hard Sun,"" a murder-of-the-week cop drama dressed up with an internal affairs investigation, attempted matricide and … the end of the world! A London detective (Jim Sturgess) and his new partner (Agyness Deyn) run into trouble when they uncover a secret of apocalyptic proportions. (Hulu, March 7) 'JESSICA JONES' The best of the many Marvel series returns after a nearly two-and-a-half-year break. No screeners, but Melissa Rosenberg is still the showrunner and Krysten Ritter is back as the surly, hard-boiled heroine. (Netflix, March 8) 'RISE' Or, ""Friday Night Footlights."" Josh Radnor stars as a frustrated teacher who takes over the theater program at a Pennsylvania high school, pushing aside a veteran drama coach played by Rosie Perez, in a series created by the ""Hamilton"" producer Jeffery Seller and the ""Friday Night Lights"" showrunner Jason Katims. (NBC, March 13) 'THE TERROR' An able crew — including Jared Harris, Ciarán Hinds, Tobias Menzies, Adam Nagaitis and Ian Hart — sets sail in this handsome mix of historical speculation and supernatural horror. Mr. Harris and Mr. Hinds play the captains of the British ships Terror and Erebus, which disappeared while trying to find the Northwest Passage in the 1840s. Based on the novel of the same name by Dan Simmons, the 10-episode series features ice, Inuits, hubris, hunger and a mysterious polar predator. (AMC, March 26) 'THE CHILD IN TIME' This BBC-""Masterpiece"" film is a CliffsNotes version of the sci-fi-inflected Ian McEwan novel of the same name about loss, regret and the nature of time. But it offers fine performances by Benedict Cumberbatch, Kelly Macdonald and the excellent, unheralded Stephen Campbell Moore (""The Last Post""). (PBS, April 1)"
0,2018-01-11," Beginning in the 1950s, the writer Philip K. Dick laid down themes for decades of science fiction (and non-science fiction). As technology perfects virtual experiences, what does ""real"" mean? Is an original necessarily more authentic than its simulacrum? So it's the most Philip K. Dick thing imaginable to find that ""Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams,"" based on his short stories, pales before some of the author's recent imitators. But here we are. I can't blame the weaknesses of ""Electric Dreams,"" whose first season arrives on Amazon on Friday, on the source material: The episodes' writers had great leeway to stray from the originals. (The same happened with Amazon's Dick adaptation ""The Man in the High Castle."") Nor is a lack of star power at fault. The credits of the 10 self-contained episodes include Greg Kinnear, Anna Paquin, Bryan Cranston (one of 14 — 14! — executive producers) and Janelle Monáe (the actress-singer who recorded ""The ArchAndroid"" plays an arch android). But this license and talent, plus the lavish scale of production, add up to little that feels freshly imagined or newly provocative. Sci-fi is having a bit of a moment: A new ""Twilight Zone"" is coming, ""Westworld"" is returning, ""The X-Files"" lives again, and next month Netflix launches ""Altered Carbon,"" a cyberpunk thriller in which downloaded consciousnesses are swapped into new bodies the way you might upgrade your phone. Most notably, ""Black Mirror"" has created various realities, united by Charlie Brooker's jaundiced view of social media and virtual intelligence, that are more chilling for how closely they resemble our own. The alt-worlds in ""Electric Dreams"" — each episode has a different writer and director — range from the quasi-present to millenniums hence. But mostly, they play with familiar ideas in conventional high-tech settings: They're futures that seem oddly dated. The season opener, ""Real Life,"" written by the executive producer Ronald D. Moore (""Battlestar Galactica""), has a quintessential Dick theme: A businessman (Terrence Howard) and a policewoman (Ms. Paquin) share a consciousness while leading separate lives — or are they separate? — in two different planes of reality. Which one is real, and which virtual? We've seen numerous versions of that ontological shell game, and this one has no new moves. ""Human Is,"" with Mr. Cranston as a sour military commander who is replaced by a more personable alien body-snatcher, moves double-time to an unsurprising conclusion. ""Crazy Diamond,"" starring Steve Buscemi, is a nigh-incomprehensible clearance sale of dystopian premises — human-animal chimeras, extreme climate change, consumerism as a tool of oppression. Elsewhere, the series veers into bludgeoning social criticism, as in ""Safe and Sound,"" a cautionary tale about the political abuse of paranoia. ""Kill All Others"" covers the same subject in what amounts to a dark-comic retread of the Cold War ""Twilight Zone"" tale ""The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street."" The advantage of a streaming anthology, though, is that you can simply skip to the good stuff. ""Impossible Planet,"" about an elderly woman booking a space cruise to visit a dead Earth, is moving if a smidge sentimental. In the noir ""The Hood Maker,"" a detective (Richard Madden, ""Game of Thrones"") partners with a telepath (Holliday Grainger) in an alt-reality where psychics serve the function of computers. (You do need to make your peace with dialogue like, ""You can read my mind — but you can't read my heart."") But the jewel of ""Electric Dreams"" is ""The Commuter"" (not to be confused with the Liam Neeson movie). A British train employee, Ed Jacobson (Timothy Spall), put-upon at work and raising a mentally troubled son at home, comes upon an odd phenomenon: Passengers at his station are buying rail tickets to a destination that doesn't exist. Ed's investigation leads him to, yes, one more parallel reality. But it also raises a universal question: At what price would you escape your pain? Mr. Spall's performance is quietly wrenching, the execution lyrical. In a series that doesn't meet its potential, ""The Commuter"" is the best of alternatives."

0,2018-01-12," David Letterman's new talk show comes to Netflix, while new adaptations of Philip K. Dick stories come to Amazon.  MY NEXT GUEST NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION WITH DAVID LETTERMAN on Netflix. David Letterman's Santa Claus beard, which he sprouted after leaving ""The Late Show"" two years ago, seemed to be a clear symbolic gesture that his days of thoughtful interviews with cultural dignitaries were over. ""The beard is a good reminder to me that that was a different life,"" he said in an  interview with The New York Times. But after a well-deserved break, Mr. Letterman will return to the screen. And although he's no longer on network TV, his interviews will still pack a wallop: His first guest is Barack Obama, with later episodes to feature George Clooney and Malala Yousafzai. THE POLKA KING on Netflix. In the films ""Nacho Libre"" and ""Walk Hard,"" Jack Black rolled out Mexican and British accents that were so bad they actually became endearing. He tries an exaggerated Polish accent in this movie, in which he stars as the real-life polka star Jan Lewan, who ended up in jail for running a Ponzi scheme (perhaps unknowingly). As with all of his best roles, Mr. Black imbues his character with a mixture of manic glee and tragedy. Jenny Slate plays his wife, while Jason Schwartzman plays his best friend. PHILIP K. DICK'S ELECTRIC DREAMS on Amazon. The worlds of Philip K. Dick seem to be multiplying. An adaptation of his novel ""The Man in the High Castle"" rolls along on Amazon, while the bleak cityscape of ""Blade Runner 2049"" arrived in theaters in October. Now, more of his hallucinatory and terrifying visions arrive on Amazon, with 10 stand-alone adaptations of his short stories. These episodes explore future scenarios both distant and very close, from parallel universes to global warming; plenty of stars show up, from Bryan Cranston to Steve Buscemi to Janelle Monáe. But the critic James Poniewozik of The Times was mostly unmoved: ""This license and talent, plus lavish scale of production, add up to little that feels freshly imagined or newly provocative,"" he wrote in his review. HELL'S KITCHEN 8 p.m. on Fox. Gordon Ramsay hosts this furiously paced cooking competition.

1,2018-01-12," David Letterman's new talk show comes to Netflix, while new adaptations of Philip K. Dick stories come to Amazon.  MY NEXT GUEST NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION WITH DAVID LETTERMAN on Netflix. David Letterman's Santa Claus beard, which he sprouted after leaving ""The Late Show"" two years ago, seemed to be a clear symbolic gesture that his days of thoughtful interviews with cultural dignitaries were over. ""The beard is a good reminder to me that that was a different life,"" he said in an  interview with The New York Times. But after a well-deserved break, Mr. Letterman will return to the screen. And although he's no longer on network TV, his interviews will still pack a wallop: His first guest is Barack Obama, with later episodes to feature George Clooney and Malala Yousafzai. THE POLKA KING on Netflix. In the films ""Nacho Libre"" and ""Walk Hard,"" Jack Black rolled out Mexican and British accents that were so bad they actually became endearing. He tries an exaggerated Polish accent in this movie, in which he stars as the real-life polka star Jan Lewan, who ended up in jail for running a Ponzi scheme (perhaps unknowingly). As with all of his best roles, Mr. Black imbues his character with a mixture of manic glee and tragedy. Jenny Slate plays his wife, while Jason Schwartzman plays his best friend. PHILIP K. DICK'S ELECTRIC DREAMS on Amazon. The worlds of Philip K. Dick seem to be multiplying. An adaptation of his novel ""The Man in the High Castle"" rolls along on Amazon, while the bleak cityscape of ""Blade Runner 2049"" arrived in theaters in October. Now, more of his hallucinatory and terrifying visions arrive on Amazon, with 10 stand-alone adaptations of his short stories. These episodes explore future scenarios both distant and very close, from parallel universes to global warming; plenty of stars show up, from Bryan Cranston to Steve Buscemi to Janelle Monáe. But the critic James Poniewozik of The Times was mostly unmoved: ""This license and talent, plus lavish scale of production, add up to little that feels freshly imagined or newly provocative,"" he wrote in his review. HELL'S KITCHEN 8 p.m. on Fox. Gordon Ramsay hosts this furiously paced cooking competition.

2,2018-01-12," SEATTLE — Jeff Bezos rubbed elbows last weekend with Halle Berry, Chris Hemsworth and other Hollywood celebrities at an after-party for the Golden Globes. In December, he walked the red carpet, along with Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks, at a screening of ""The Post"" in Washington. On Friday, Mr. Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, made public their $33 million donation to a nonprofit that provides college scholarships to so-called Dreamers, young immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children. In October, he received an award for a donation to a marriage equality campaign. Jennifer Cast, an Amazon executive who solicited the donation from him, said at the event that they could have donated anonymously to the campaign. ""But just as critical as the money was Jeff's offer to let us publicly acknowledge their gifts,"" she said. ""By allowing us to take their donation public,"" she added, ""the world quickly knew that Jeff Bezos supported marriage equality."" The appearances and actions are a new look for Mr. Bezos. As he was shaping Amazon into one of the world's most valuable companies, Mr. Bezos developed a reputation as a brilliant but mysterious and coldblooded corporate titan. He preferred to hunker down in Amazon's hometown, Seattle, at least partly because he thought it was better for Amazon's growing business, largely avoiding public causes and the black-tie circuit. But while Mr. Bezos — who at 54 is the world's richest person, with a net worth of more than $100 billion — can afford virtually any luxury, obscurity is no longer among them. Amazon, now a behemoth valued at more than $600 billion, has become one of the faces of ""big tech,"" along with Apple, Alphabet's Google and Facebook. These companies are facing a backlash. Amazon is under the microscope for what critics say is its corrosive effect on jobs and competition, and Mr. Bezos has become a bête noire for President Trump, who repeatedly singles out him and Amazon for scorn on Twitter. ""People are starting to get scared of Amazon,"" said Steve Case, a co-founder of America Online, who recently started an investment fund focused on start-ups in underserved areas, with Mr. Bezos among its contributors. ""If Jeff continues to hang out in Seattle, he's going to get a lot more incoming. Even for just defense reasons, he has to now play offense."" Mr. Bezos' portfolio of other ventures has thrust him farther into the spotlight. In October 2013, he bought The Washington Post for $250 million, jump-starting a renaissance of the paper. In 2016, Mr. Bezos bought a $23 million home in Washington, one of the city's most expensive, which is undergoing extensive renovations to make it a suitable party spot for the city's political class. Nearby neighbors include former President Barack Obama and his family, and Mr. Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner. Mr. Bezos' space start-up, Blue Origin, is also making its efforts more public, giving him another stage. The company is trying to rescue Earth by helping to move pollution-belching heavy industries off the planet. ""He's getting thanked at the Golden Globes and targeted by presidential tweet tantrums — not even Steve Jobs had that kind of pop-culture currency,"" said Margaret O'Mara, a professor of history at the University of Washington, who curated a museum exhibit in Seattle endowed by Mr. Bezos. In a statement, Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, said, ""Jeff loves what he is doing, at Amazon, Blue Origin and The Washington Post, and he enjoys sharing his enthusiasm in public as he works with the teams to build and invent."" But interviews with more than 30 people who know Mr. Bezos, most of whom declined to be identified to protect their relationships with him, revealed his awareness of the growing opposition to Amazon and his growing comfort with being in the public eye. Mr. Bezos, they said, accepts the probability of greater government scrutiny of Amazon. The chief executive has advised Amazon executives to conduct themselves so that they can pass any legal or regulatory test. The investor Warren E. Buffett, who has known Mr. Bezos since the 1990s, said the cautionary tale of Microsoft, which faced a landmark antitrust case by the government that decade, must loom in Mr. Bezos' mind. Microsoft, by far the most dominant technology company at the time, lost its footing after the case, opening an unexpected opportunity for competitors. ""You're going to get a lot of scrutiny if you're disrupting other people's livelihoods,"" Mr. Buffett said. Some of the people who know Mr. Bezos said his new public face was for business expediency. Others believe it is a result of personal growth. But they all said it was clear that Mr. Bezos and Amazon were trying to go beyond his tech persona to show the world his other sides. Mr. Bezos has always been happy to play the role of Amazon's chief pitchman, especially when he perceives some benefit to Amazon customers from doing so, people who have worked with him said. He submits to interviews and speaks at events when, for instance, a new company product like the Kindle electronic reader or Echo speaker needs to be explained to the world. But for nearly two decades, he was adamant that the company should largely stay out of the political limelight and not make a stir in local communities. It also had a bare-bones lobbying operation. Even as he was named Time magazine's person of the year in 1999, he tried to avoid politics. He was even reluctant to do photo opportunities with politicians, standard fare for executives, one longtime former employee said. There were business benefits to staying out of the glare. A hedge fund executive in New York who caught the internet bug early, Mr. Bezos piled into a vehicle with his wife in 1994 with the intention of finding a place to start a business selling books on the internet. He founded Amazon later that year in Seattle, in part because of the growing pool of technical talent Microsoft had brought to the area. But putting his start-up in Washington also meant Amazon would not have to collect sales tax in the country's most populous states, like California, Texas and New York. Retailers typically have an obligation to collect sales tax in states where they have a physical presence. For a time, for the same reason, the company would not publicly discuss where most of its warehouses were. And Amazon employees in Seattle who planned to travel out of state for work had to submit itineraries for review to avoid triggering unwanted sales tax liabilities. Those efforts would, in turn, give his fledgling company a further price advantage against established physical retailers like Barnes & Noble. It also meant that, despite its growing legions of customers, Amazon remained almost invisible in politics. By the end of 2012, the company had swelled to more than 88,000 employees and over $61 billion in annual sales, creating huge businesses like its Prime membership service and Amazon Web Services along the way. Yet that year the company was criticized by leaders in Seattle and the news media for being disengaged from civic life compared with stalwarts like Boeing and Starbucks. ""I'm not aware of what Amazon does in the community,"" Sally Jewell, the chief executive of the retailer R.E.I. at the time, said in The Seattle Times in 2012. ""It's not a name that comes up often in the nonprofit organizations I'm involved with."" With investors, Mr. Bezos gave just enough of a peek at Amazon's business to win their confidence while saying as little as possible to keep competitors guessing. To this day, Amazon will not disclose exactly how many Kindles, Echoes and other devices it has sold, and for years it refused to reveal financial details about Amazon Web Services, its highly profitable cloud computing business. Despite the paucity of details, investors have sent its stock up more than 1,100 percent over the last decade, dazzled by its growth. A turning point came for Mr. Bezos around 2011 when Amazon faced a public showdown with state governments. At the time, legislators began hounding internet retailers like Amazon to collect sales tax. In California, Amazon initially campaigned to overturn a new law imposing an internet sales tax. But Mr. Bezos backed off after it became clear that Amazon's image could be tarnished, a former employee involved in the matter said. Instead, Amazon began to make peace. In 2011, it signed an agreement with California to collect sales tax in the state, reaching numerous similar agreements around the same time. As part of those state deals, Amazon began building warehouses across the country, which allowed Amazon to deliver orders more quickly and let local politicians trumpet the arrival of thousands of jobs. Suddenly, a company that once refused to confirm how many employees it had at its Seattle headquarters could not stop talking about how many jobs it was creating. It now has 542,000 employees. As Mr. Bezos and the company talked about creating jobs, though, he and Amazon faced a counternarrative from critics that the company was really a job-killing bully. Waves of store closings by bricks-and-mortar retailers like Barnes & Noble and Macy's increased the volume. ""Amazon Must Be Stopped,"" read a 2014 New Republic article about the company's growing market power. That year, a nasty fight over e-book prices with Hachette, the book publisher, solidified Amazon's reputation for using brass-knuckle tactics. At one point, Amazon slowed delivery times for the publisher's titles and took other steps to make them less attractive to order. After the matter was resolved, Mr. Bezos told an interviewer that Amazon was simply negotiating hard on behalf of its customers. ""It's very difficult for incumbents who have a sweet thing to accept change,"" he said, referring to book publishers. Another blow to the company's public standing landed in 2015 when The New York Times published a lengthy examination of Amazon's corporate work culture, which was depicted as an unforgiving environment. ""The article doesn't describe the Amazon I know or the caring Amazonians I work with every day,"" Mr. Bezos said in an email to the company's employees after the article came out. According to two people who work closely with Mr. Bezos, the chief executive became more focused on corporate reputation issues after The Times article and the Hachette uproar. By late 2015, a few months after Mr. Trump announced his campaign for president, he started his Twitter broadsides against Mr. Bezos, which often coincided with critical coverage of the candidate in The Washington Post. ""The @washingtonpost loses money (a deduction) and gives owner @JeffBezos power to screw public on low taxation of @Amazon!"" he tweeted in December that year. ""Big tax shelter."" Mr. Bezos responded by offering to launch the future president of the United States into space on a Blue Origin rocket. A White House spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. The attention in Washington edged up in June when Amazon announced it was buying Whole Foods Markets. Though Amazon remains a niche player in the grocery business, the deal drove home the power of the company and led some lawmakers to question its power. ""The purchase of Whole Foods was a moment when people looked up and recognized this company as a force in the economy,"" said Stacy Mitchell, a co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit advocacy group for local businesses, which has published a critical report on Amazon's impact on jobs and communities. People who have known Mr. Bezos for a long time say they see a concerted effort by him and Amazon to show more of his personality. He became an active user of Twitter in late 2015, posting a photo of himself wearing his lucky cowboy boots and a video clip of him standing atop a wind turbine in Texas. At an event with his brother in Los Angeles in November, as part of a long lineup of presentations by an array of business, wellness and entertainment leaders, he said his ideal job would be bartender, partly because he enjoys talking to people. ""I pride myself on my craft cocktails,"" he said. If there's an image that captures Mr. Bezos at the moment, it's a picture of him with his biceps bulging out of a polo shirt at a business conference in Idaho from July. ""Swole Jeff Bezos"" instantly became an internet meme, with one tweet juxtaposing shots of a doughy Mr. Bezos from the late 1990s (caption: ""I sell books"") and the brawny 2017 version (""I sell whatever I want""). The details people are willing to talk about include scraps about his daily routine. On most days, he leaves his lakefront estate in the affluent town of Medina, Wash., for a sparkling new 37-story office tower in Seattle, where he runs Amazon. On Wednesdays, he heads south to an industrial office park in the suburb of Kent, where rockets are assembled for Blue Origin. Every other week, he huddles on conference calls with The Post's leadership, and twice a year they visit him at his home. He communicates with the newspaper's top brass with an email list called the Pancakes Group. The Amazon chief once made members of the group flapjacks from a favorite recipe in ""Joy of Cooking"" on their first visit to his house. ""It wasn't like we went to some billionaire's house and the help outnumbered the guests,"" said Shailesh Prakash, the newspaper's chief information officer. ""He was trying to get the dog off the couch."" Mr. Bezos' more public-facing work was abetted by a management change nearly two years ago at Amazon, when he put Jeff Wilke in charge of its consumer business and Andy Jassy in charge of cloud computing. That freed him up to devote more time to The Post and Blue Origin, though he remains deeply engaged at Amazon, dedicating most of his time to initiatives that are two to four years away from hitting the market. Mr. Bezos has also pushed using publicity to the company's advantage. In September, he masterminded the company's splashy search for a place to locate a second headquarters. In the hoopla, Amazon highlighted the jobs it planned to create with the move — up to 50,000 total — and spurred a horde of towns, from Dallas to Boston, to apply. In the future, that means Mr. Bezos will most likely be a more familiar presence in Washington. Mr. Bezos now visits Washington about 10 times a year, dropping in at The Post for forums, discussions with engineers and meals with journalists. In the capital's stately Kalorama neighborhood, just off Massachusetts Avenue's row of embassies, renovations are proceeding on his home — two combined properties that used to be the city's Textile Museum. Mr. Bezos plans to host salon-style dinners at the house, drawing inspiration from the celebrated dinner parties thrown by Katharine Graham, the former publisher of The Post, for the city's movers and shakers from both parties. Mr. Bezos is known for asking his dinner guests to stick to a single conversation topic at a time to keep people from splintering off into private side discussions. ""It's a very big house,"" said Martin Baron, the executive editor of The Post. ""I hope he has a party for us in the house."" Sally Quinn, a longtime Post writer and an arbiter of the city's social mores, said she had no firsthand knowledge of Mr. Bezos' plans for his home. But she praised the idea of attempting to bring together guests from across the political spectrum. ""There's really no one who is doing that kind of thing in Washington right now,"" said Ms. Quinn, who bumped into Mr. Bezos recently at the screening of ""The Post."" ""It would be like a throwback to the old days."" ""I think Jeff,"" she said, ""is the only person who could do that."""
3,2018-01-12," SEATTLE — Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, on Friday injected himself into one of the most contentious political debates in the United States, announcing that he and his wife had donated $33 million to a college scholarship program geared toward young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. Mr. Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, gave the money to the nonprofit Dream.US. The group said the donation, the largest in its history, would finance scholarships for 1,000 high school graduates who have been allowed to stay in the United States under  the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. The roughly 800,000 so-called Dreamers affected by the program face an uncertain future after President Trump said last year that he planned to end the protections. Uncertainty continued to swirl around the program this week, with a federal judge ruling that the Trump administration must maintain it as a legal fight over the president's decision proceeds and Mr. Trump sending mixed signals about his willingness to strike a deal with Congress that would offer Dreamers a path to citizenship. Mr. Trump has regularly criticized Mr. Bezos, both for his role at Amazon and for his ownership of The Washington Post, which he bought in 2013. Mr. Trump has accused Amazon of sidestepping taxes and The Post of covering him unfairly. Don Graham, the publisher of The Post when Mr. Bezos bought the paper, is a founder of Dream.US. Mr. Bezos said in a statement that the donation was inspired by the example of his father, Miguel, who came to the United States from Cuba in the early 1960s as part of a wave of thousands of unaccompanied minors. ""My dad came to the U.S. when he was 16 as part of Operation Pedro Pan,"" Mr. Bezos said in the statement. ""He landed in this country alone and unable to speak English. With a lot of grit and determination, and the help of some remarkable organizations in Delaware, my dad became an outstanding citizen, and he continues to give back to the country that he feels blessed him in so many ways. MacKenzie and I are honored to be able to help today's Dreamers by funding these scholarships."" Mr. Bezos is not the first wealthy technology executive to donate to Dream.US. Two years ago, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, and his wife, Priscilla Chan, gave the group $5 million."
0,2018-01-15," SAN FRANCISCO — These days, you can find virtual assistants like Amazon's Alexa or Google's Assistant in all sorts of things, from smart speakers and smartphones to washing machines and bathroom mirrors. The challenge isn't finding these digitized helpers, it is finding people who use them to do much more than they could with the old clock/radio in the bedroom. A management consulting firm recently looked at heavy users of virtual assistants, defined as people who use one more than three times a day. The firm, called Activate, found that the majority of these users turned to virtual assistants to play music, get the weather, set a timer or ask questions. Activate also found that the majority of Alexa users had never used more than the basic apps that come with the device, although Amazon said its data suggested that four out of five registered Alexa customers have used at least one of the more than 30,000 ""skills"" — third-party apps that tap into Alexa's voice controls to accomplish tasks — it makes available. But while some hard-core fans are indeed tapping into advanced features of virtual assistants, like controlling the lights in their homes, for the most part, ""people are still using these speakers for very routine tasks,"" said Michael J. Wolf, the founder of Activate. ""It's not clear that there is something that's going to drive people to use these."" Apple popularized the virtual assistant concept in 2011 when it introduced technology called Siri in its iPhones. About three years later, Amazon debuted the Echo, a speaker packed with microphones to capture and decipher what we're saying to Alexa. Soon, various technology companies were betting that speaking to machines through virtual assistants would be an essential way for consumers to interact with devices and services in the future. There is a reason tech companies think virtual assistants are so important: They want to control an indispensable ""platform"" — a crucial piece of technology other services or devices must rely upon. Some believe virtual assistant technology can be that sort of platform, and the company with the most useful assistant will gain an advantage for their other services — like internet search or online shopping. Lose that competition, however, and a company could be at the mercy of its rivals. With those stakes in mind, tech giants have been scrambling to make their assistants omnipresent. Since smart speakers are the main way for people to deal with virtual assistants, Amazon and Google stoked holiday sales with heavy discounts, dropping the price of their entry-level models to $30, from $50. At the same time, tech companies have been putting their assistants inside products of all shapes and sizes. Before last week's International CES tech conference in Las Vegas, Amazon announced a string of new Alexa partnerships. Hisense will put the assistant into its television sets, while Kohler said a new bathroom mirror will have built-in microphones so people can use Alexa to dim the lights and fill a bathtub using voice commands. PC makers like HP, Asus and Acer said they were integrating Alexa into their computers, while Panasonic, Garmin and other electronics makers will do the same for devices that go into cars. Amazon also announced an agreement with Toyota to integrate Alexa into some Toyota and Lexus vehicles. Ditto for a new smoke alarm from First Alert. Google said LG Televisions, headphones from Sony and smart displays from Lenovo will tap into its Assistant. For now, consumers' satisfaction with their smart speakers — and by extension, the onboard assistants — is helped in part by the fact they didn't pay a lot to get them into their homes. Justin Hosseininejad, an engineering consultant from Medina, Ohio, said he bought his first Amazon Echo Dot for $50 last year and got a second one free a few months ago with another internet-connected device, the Nest thermostat. He uses them to listen to news in the morning and play music throughout the day. He recognizes that he's not asking Alexa to do a lot, but considering how little he paid, he is fine with that. ""There's only certain things I use it for, but I'm happy with it,"" he said. ""I'm not doing my taxes with it."" Paul Erickson, a senior analyst at the research firm IHS Markit, said the next step for these devices will be to become the hub of a connected home, controlling internet-connected lights, thermostats and other basic home appliances. ""The more interesting functionality is yet to come,"" Mr. Erickson said. ""Part of that will come as more integration happens this year and next year. This is the first year we're going to see real advances with the assistants because of competition in the marketplace."" Competitors of Google and Amazon are also spreading their assistants far and wide. Apple now has Siri running across its universe of devices, along with an upcoming smart speaker called HomePod. Samsung has its own assistant, Bixby, available in its phones and televisions, and Microsoft has Cortana as a feature built into its Windows software. Amazon has turned its Echo family of products and the Alexa assistant that powers them into the unlikeliest of success stories — although it is hard to say exactly how successful because it shrouds its disclosures about devices sales in fuzzy language. Amazon would say only that it sold ""tens of millions"" of Alexa devices during the recent holiday season, millions more than the same period last year. Analysts estimate that Echo accounts for over 70 percent of sales in the smart speaker category, with Google a distant second. Google was also coy about revealing exact sales of Google Home. In a statement on Jan. 5, Google announced it has sold one Google Home smart speaker every second since it started shipping a smaller version of voice-controlled device on October 19 — or about 79 days. That works out to roughly seven million units. In the 20 months since it first started making the Google Assistant available as part of its Allo messaging app, Google said its Assistant is now accessible on more than 400 million devices including washing machines, dryers, air-conditioners, refrigerators and dishwashers from LG, headphones from Bose and a range of speakers from 15 different companies. Google said the Assistant can now accomplish more than one million tasks, or ""actions,"" such as asking for photos from Halloween or adding events to a calendar. It created a directory — searchable, of course — to highlight these capabilities, hoping to remind users that the Assistant can do more than set a timer. There are signs that some consumers are starting to recognize the value of virtual assistants even if they aren't interested in smart speakers. Mr. Hosseininejad's friend Stephen Melik, also an engineer from Ohio, said he uses Siri on his Apple Watch and iPhone to control his lights and power switches. But the notion of a stand-alone smart speaker that remains in one place doesn't make sense to him. ""I've always viewed these smart speakers as a solution searching for a problem,"" he said. ""But the voice assistants, potentially there are a lot of benefits to it."""
0,2018-01-18," Amazon has disrupted great swaths of the retailing landscape, but it's choosing not to break the mold with its second headquarters. The e-commerce giant has cut the field of candidates to 20 prime locations to complement its Seattle base, including Atlanta, Dallas and New York. Hundreds of cities hoped Amazon would think outside the box, but a desire for talent and a welcoming environment led it to the usual hot spots. The company, led by Jeff Bezos, started the process in typically innovative fashion in September by issuing an unusual and very public request for proposals. Fully 238 localities in the United States, Canada and Mexico submitted bids, lured by the prospect of $5 billion in investment and a promised 50,000 jobs with compensation averaging over $100,000 each. Distressed cities like Detroit and Hartford marshaled civic and business leaders to make their cases, seeing the investment as a chance to transform their economic prospects. New Jersey's former governor Chris Christie dressed up Newark's bid with $7 billion in potential tax breaks. The contest even prompted the mayor of Stonecrest, an Atlanta suburb, to rename the town Amazon and make Mr. Bezos mayor for life if he chose the town. With the exception of Newark, most have come away empty-handed. That's not a surprise given Amazon's criteria of a large metropolitan area, a strong pool of technical talent, a business-friendly environment and good transportation links. But it's disappointing that with the exception of a couple of outsiders like Indianapolis and Columbus, Ohio, the company's finalists — which also include Austin, Tex., Boston, Los Angeles, Toronto and the suburbs of Washington — are just about everyone else's, too. A conventional choice will no doubt serve Amazon well. Meanwhile, the innovative ideas the bidding process inspired among politicians and business executives around the country might just prompt other companies to think farther outside the box."
1,2018-01-18," Amazon Studios has canceled three critically acclaimed comedies: ""One Mississippi,"" ""I Love Dick"" and ""Jean-Claude Van Johnson."" The decision continues a roller-coaster stretch for the studio, which recently lost its president, Roy Price, following sexual harassment allegations; scored a ""Lord of the Rings"" adaptation; and picked up wins at the Golden Globes. The cancellations signal a recalibration for Amazon, which has taken a middle path in output compared to Netflix — which plans to flood the market with new shows and movies, estimating to spend between $7 billion and $8 billion on original content in 2018 — and HBO, which has devoted its resources to a few cultural juggernauts like ""Game of Thrones"" and ""Westworld."" Amazon spent an estimated $4.5 billion in 2017 and tried to reach an array of audiences. ""Jean-Claude Van Johnson"" was an action comedy starring Jean-Claude Van Damme as a washed-up version of himself, while ""One Mississippi,"" created by Tig Notaro, and ""I Love Dick,"" by Jill Soloway and Sarah Gubbins, explored sickness, sexuality and gender roles with a frank honesty. All three received strong reviews, but they mostly failed to break into award races or generate mainstream attention. The studio is not abandoning female-led comedies altogether: ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" will move forward after winning best television comedy series at the Golden Globes this month; and the studio just inked a two-year deal with Sharon Horgan, the creator of ""Catastrophe."" But the move does indicate a scaling back of smaller projects in favor of landing a mainstream hit. The studio passed on three comedy pilots in December — including the Bridget Everett vehicle ""Love You More"" — and canceled the feminist show ""Good Girls Revolt,"" set in 1969 and '70. The studio will now turn its attention toward larger projects, including its $200 million prize acquisition: an adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings."" ""Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan,"" an action series starring John Krasinski, will arrive this year, while ""The Romanoffs,"" a new show from ""Mad Men"" creator Matthew Weiner is in production. Amazon also announced on Thursday that ""The Tick"" was picked up for a second season. The future of ""Transparent,"" Jill Soloway's critically beloved show, remains in limbo following sexual harassment allegations against its star Jeffrey Tambor."
2,2018-01-18," The New York metropolitan area picked up a one-two punch Thursday in the battle among North American cities hoping to become home to Amazon's second headquarters, when both Newark and New York City landed on the retail giant's shortlist. The Seattle-based retailer had set off a frenzy among cities in the United States and Canada when it announced in September that it was looking for a location for its second headquarters, dangling promises of $5 billion in investment and as many as 50,000 jobs. More than 238 applications poured in to Amazon from cities and regions vying to become its ""HQ2."" Amazon has narrowed the list to 20, with most finalists far from the tech-saturated hubs on the West Coast. Along with Newark and New York City, Boston, Atlanta, Denver and Nashville all made the cut. ""New York gets two bites of the apple,"" said Patrick L. Anderson, of the Anderson Economic Group, which advises cities on economic development and had handicapped the Amazon sweepstakes. Before Amazon released its list of finalists, some analysts had dismissed the chances of either New York City or Newark. New York City was considered too expensive, and Newark was seen as hampered by its reputation as a hardscrabble urban center. But Ras Baraka, the mayor of Newark, and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, one of the city's most prominent residents, seemed intent Thursday on trying to capitalize on that image by appealing to Amazon's potential to be a game-changer for the state's largest city. ""We have sites ready downtown, or on the waterfront. We have universities and fiber,"" Mr. Baraka said. ""Amazon could have a transformative effect on one of America's oldest cities. This is an opportunity for Amazon to change the narrative about the company and where it's headed."" New York City is already home to a large Amazon distribution center in Staten Island and offices for more than 2,000 finance, sales and marketing workers in Manhattan. New Jersey has three Amazon distribution centers, including one 12 miles from Newark. If Amazon finds housing and the cost of doing business too high in New York City, it could turn to Newark, which sits atop the fiber optic cable spine running along the Eastern Seaboard and is in the midst of a resurgence. Office and apartment rents are substantially lower and Amazon already has a subsidiary there, Audible. Either way, Amazon could tap into a tech work force of nearly 300,000 people, far more than Chicago (138,813) or Los Angeles (166,234), two cities that also made Amazon's shortlist. The impact of 50,000 new jobs would be felt throughout the metro area. ""Newark, New York City and Chicago all have very strong workforces,"" Mr. Anderson said. ""Newark has the advantage on cost of doing business, which is very important to Amazon."" Mr. Anderson had put New York at the top of his list when he rated the competition last fall. Nearly three-quarters of his top 20 picks landed on Amazon's shortlist. But the eventual winner is by no means a foregone conclusion. The Washington, D.C., metropolitan area presents a triple threat, with three areas — Northern Virginia, Montgomery County, Md., and the capital itself — making the list. Jeff Bezos, chairman of Amazon, has a home in Washington and owns the local newspaper, The Washington Post. Still, there are 100,000 more tech workers in the New York region than in Washington and its suburbs. Amazon's finalist list hews closely to the criteria it established at the beginning of the contest: a metro area of more than a million residents; ease of transportation; a business-friendly environment; potential to attract and retain technical talent; and a strong university system. ""This is what Amazon said they wanted in a candidate,"" Mr. Anderson said. ""No incentives, silly sales pitches or talk of how cool their sports teams are."" But at this stage of the contest, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, the subsidy packages that competing cities offer Amazon may influence the decision. ""Amazon, like most big companies, is dollars-and-cents oriented,"" Mr. Zandi said. ""Here's where incentive packages may tip the scales."" The state of New Jersey, which is backing Newark's bid, has offered the biggest plum of all: $5 billion in tax breaks, grants and other subsidies. Newark officials have also discussed a supplementary subsidy package that could be worth as much as $2 billion. ""In the last decade, Newark has experienced unparalleled growth, paving the way for many new companies to call our city home. A Newark HQ2 would mean tens of thousands of local jobs, a boost to our regional economy and small businesses, and an opportunity for Amazon to take a tremendous stake in the continued transformation of our great city,"" Mr. Booker said. Critics contend that the Garden State is being overly generous with tax dollars. ""We remain wary of the steep price tag for taxpayers that state and local lawmakers have already put on this project,"" said Jon Whiten, vice president of New Jersey Policy Perspective. ""It has ensured that the returns will be minimized if Amazon were to ultimately choose the state."" The administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio was less generous, announcing New York City would not offer any special subsidies or incentives for Amazon beyond the city's existing programs. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo did say that the state would provide a benefit package for Amazon, although he did not disclose any details. On the same day New York City submitted its bid to Amazon, Mr. de Blasio criticized the company for its destructive impact on local shop owners. But at this point, neither that criticism nor the lack of an enhanced subsidy package has hurt New York's chances. ""We're not changing our approach,"" said Alicia Glen, New York City's deputy mayor for economic development. ""We offered four very viable options in different neighborhoods. If you want to hire 50,000 incredibly smart people, there's no better place. And a city that has art, culture, food and urban walkability are a huge priority for this generation of workers."" The Partnership for New York City, a business group that has strongly supported the city's bid for Amazon, said New York's chances are good. ""Amazon is notoriously cheap and our costs our high,"" said Kathryn Wylde, the Partnership's president. ""But in every other way, New York is a winner. It has the markets they want to reach, the talent and a strong history as a global retail capital. The question is, 'Does Bezos sees the value of mixing with the global industries and market leaders that are based in New York?' """
3,2018-01-18," Amazon's hunt for a second headquarters, after several months of publicity stunts and dangled perks from cities and regions vying to lure the e-commerce giant, has been narrowed to 20 options from 238 bids.  The company, which is based in Seattle, plans to invest $5 billion in development and create up to 50,000 jobs wherever it builds its newest hub. Among its criteria: more than one million residents, proximity to an airport, manageable commutes, diverse demographics, connectivity and local schools churning out potential employees. With the kind of enthusiasm normally reserved for bids to host the Olympics, governors, mayors, business leaders and others have pulled together proposals promoting the potential of their cities and regions, sometimes going to outlandish lengths.  These are the places that caught Amazon's attention.  Population: 472,000 in the city and 5.7 million in the metropolitan area. Schools: Georgia Tech, Emory University, Georgia State University, and Morehouse and Spelman Colleges are in the city. The University of Georgia is about 70 miles away. Transit: The airport is, by some metrics, the largest in the world. There are rail and streetcar systems, but most residents depend on the sprawling network of interstates. Atlanta's traffic jams are notorious. Perks: Gov. Nathan Deal said he would call a special legislative session to work out an incentives deal if a location in Georgia was among the final three contenders. Population: 947,000 in the city and two million in the metropolitan area. Schools: The University of Texas' flagship campus, which enrolls more than 51,000 students, is in the city. St. Edward's University, a Roman Catholic institution, is also in Austin. Transit: Austin's airport has flights to most major American cities and to Europe. The city also has a commuter rail line, but most people use cars to get around.  Perks: ""I still not have heard any conversations about offering incentives,"" Mayor Steve Adler said at a Thursday news conference. He said there needed to be ""a very open and transparent community conversation about Amazon and all these related issues."" Population: 673,000 in the city and 4.8 million in the metropolitan area, according to census data from 2016. Schools: The caliber of local schools is impressive, including Harvard University, Boston University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Tufts University. Transit: Logan International Airport is 15 minutes from Boston's financial district. Amtrak trains make dozens of trips between Boston, New York and Washington each weekday. And a third of Boston residents take public transportation to work, according to the city's bid.  Perks: The proposal does not promise any specific financial incentives to help reel in Amazon. But Worcester, which is roughly an hour away from Boston, has pledged $500 million in property tax breaks spread over 20 years, according to The Boston Globe. Other: Boston's bid pointed to the more than 150 robotics companies in the area, the 3,200 people working in robotics jobs and the $200 million in private investments garnered by the field in the last year.  Population: 2.7 million people in the city and 9.5 million in the metropolitan area. Schools: The Chicago area is home to Northwestern, the University of Chicago and the Illinois Institute of Technology. Transit: Chicago has some of the nation's worst traffic. But officials boast that its extensive subway and commuter rail system runs far more efficiently than networks in many major cities. O'Hare International Airport is one of the busiest airports in the world; Midway International Airport is another sizable hub. Perks: Chicago promised roughly $2 billion in tax incentives and infrastructure spending, and $250 million for work force training, according to The Chicago Tribune. Officials identified 10 potential downtown, urban and suburban sites for Amazon's facilities.  Other: The city's association with violence — it led the nation in murders with 765 in 2016 — coexists alongside a cultural scene that features some of the most celebrated food and art in the country. Population: Two million in the metropolitan area. Schools: Ohio State University is the big wheel in town, with more than 66,000 students, but smaller schools abound. Transit: The city beat out 77 competitors to win federal funding in 2016 to plan and build what the Department of Transportation's Smart Cities Challenge project. Perks: The city's bid was created by Columbus 2020, the regional economic-development arm for an 11-county region, which has released few specifics. Population: 1.3 million in the city and 7.2 million in the metropolitan area. Schools: Southern Methodist University, home to George W. Bush's presidential library, is in Dallas, and Texas Christian University is in nearby Fort Worth. The University of Texas has campuses in the suburbs of Richardson and Arlington. Transit: The airport is one of the country's busiest, but public transit fares poorly when compared with systems in other large cities. A high-speed rail line to Houston is in the works. Perks: The city has not released details, but Mayor Mike Rawlings said in an interview Thursday that he believed local and state ""incentives are going to be an important part of this."" He said the city was waiting to hear more from Amazon about the next steps. Population: 693,000 in the city and 2.9 million in the metropolitan area. Schools: Amazon could draw from Regis University, the University of Denver, the University of Colorado and other schools. The Colorado School of Mines in nearby Golden is known for its engineering and applied sciences work. Transit: Denver International Airport has the third-largest domestic air service network in the country, according to a copy of the city's bid obtained by The Denver Post. The region has added some 122 miles of commuter lines, light rail and bus services in the last 15 years.  Perks: If Amazon chooses a city or county in Colorado, it could potentially have access to more than $100 million in incentives, pulled from a state fund set up to recruit large employers and from a tax credit to encourage job growth, according to The Denver Post. Other: Denver, with its reputation for progressive politics and outdoor activities, is popular with millennials. Google, Twitter, Oracle and IBM all have offices in Denver or in nearby Boulder.  Population: 855,164 in the city and two million in the metropolitan area. Schools: The city can claim the University of Indianapolis, Butler University and Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis. Transit: Getting around has meant mostly driving. But in 2016, voters approved a local income tax increase to fund transit improvements including a big expansion of bus service. Perks: The city's bid was put together by the Indy Chamber, an economic development group, in conjunction Indianapolis and Fishers, a nearby city, but few details have emerged. Population: Four million in the city and 13.1 million in the metropolitan area. Schools: The University of California, Los Angeles, proclaims the city's name in its brand, but higher education also abounds at California State University Los Angeles and private schools like Loyola Marymount University and International American University. Transit: Los Angeles defined the modern idea of long-distance commuting through a haze of car-exhaust smog, but is now building one of the most ambitious and expensive transit systems in the nation, funded by a 0.5 percent local sales tax approved by voters in 2016. Perks: The city's bid was formulated in conjunction with Los Angeles County, and has largely been kept secret for what a spokesman for Mayor Eric M. Garcetti said were competitive reasons. Gov. Jerry Brown also offered Amazon an incentive package on behalf of the state, including tax credits and a pledge to support the streamlining of permits, approvals and regulations. Population: Six million in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach Counties, which submitted a joint application to Amazon. Schools: The University of Miami is the best-known school in the region, which is also home to Florida International University in western Miami-Dade, Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton and several other institutions. Transit: Miami International, one of three airports in the South Florida region, leads the nation in international cargo service. But Miami also suffers from dreadful traffic. A new express train connecting Miami to Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach might offer some congestion relief. Perks: The region has kept its application secret, but it proposed eight sites to Amazon: five in Miami-Dade, two in Broward and one in Palm Beach. Other: Some local officials have been openly skeptical of Miami's chances, citing the limited public transportation system. Population: One million. Schools: The University of Maryland's main campus is just over the county line in Prince George's County. Johns Hopkins University is an hour drive away in Baltimore, and several other schools are even closer. Transit: Montgomery County, home to the northern Washington suburbs of Bethesda and Silver Spring, is near three major airports and on the Metro system, where a new purple line extending service is under construction. Perks: Montgomery County has not made its bid public, but it promoted a 60-acre site near a Metro stop. Population: 684,000 in the city and 1.8 million in the metropolitan area. Schools: Nashville is home to several private universities, including Vanderbilt, Lipscomb and Belmont. Tennessee State University, a historically black institution, is also in Nashville.  Transit: City leaders have urged a swift expansion of the public transportation system, which is less expansive than those in many other finalist cities. Perks: City officials declined to comment on incentives. Population: 282,000. Schools: Rutgers University's main campus is a 40-minute drive away, and Newark has a satellite campus. Princeton University is about an hour away. And New York — 30 minutes away on the PATH train — is home to numerous universities. Transit: New Jersey Transit serves the city. The PATH train links Newark to New York's subway system. And the Northeast Corridor is connected on Amtrak. The proposed Amazon site is near Newark Liberty International Airport, which is also a FedEx hub. Perks: New Jersey offered Amazon about $5 billion in tax breaks over a decade if it creates 30,000 jobs and makes $3 billion in capital investments, under legislation signed by Gov. Chris Christie before he left office. Newark, New Jersey's largest city, put up additional property-tax abatements and a payroll-tax break, together worth up to $2 billion.  Population: 8.5 million. Schools: The city says it's home to 105 ""institutions of higher learning,"" including major universities like Columbia University, New York University, the City University of New York and the State University of New York. Transit: Few people want to drive, but the subway system — for all of its problems — is extensive, as are the bus and commuter rail options. Public transit is available into the three major international airports, Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty. Perks: New York did not offer special subsidies or tax breaks beyond the ones available to any company. It listed four possible neighborhoods for the headquarters: the West Side of Manhattan, Lower Manhattan, Long Island City in Queens and the Brooklyn Tech Triangle, which includes Downtown, Dumbo and Brooklyn Navy Yard.  Other: The city tops a study of cities best able to meet Amazon's requirements, compiled by Anderson Economic Group, with Chicago second Population: 1.8 million in Arlington, Fairfax and Loudoun Counties. Schools: George Mason University is in Fairfax, with a number of other universities nearby. The University of Virginia, Richmond University and Virginia Commonwealth University are two-hour drives away. Transit: Northern Virginia boasts two major airports, Ronald Reagan Washington National and Washington Dulles. Driving on and around the Beltway can be horrendous, but commuters can also take the Metro subway system and the Virginia Railway Express, a suburban commuter rail system. Perks: Northern Virginia's proposal included four potential sites, one each in Alexandria, Arlington County, Fairfax County and Loudoun County. Population: 1.6 million in the city and 6.1 million in the metropolitan area. Schools: The employee pipeline to Amazon could come from the University of Pennsylvania, Temple University, Drexel University and other local campuses. Transit: Philadelphia has hundreds of miles of bike lanes with an extensive bike-sharing network. The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority is the fifth-largest transit system in the country.  Perks: Settling down in Philadelphia (or Pittsburgh) could net Amazon more than $1 billion in tax incentives. Other: On its bid website, Philadelphia pitched itself as an affordable option for Amazon employees. The cost of living in the city is 18 percent lower than it is in Seattle, where median home prices are nearly twice as high. Population: 304,000 in the city and 2.3 million in the metropolitan area. Schools: Potential breeding grounds for future employees include Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pittsburgh and Duquesne University. Transit: The Pittsburgh International Airport lost thousands of jobs and hundreds of flights when a US Airways hub shut down in 2004, but nonstop destinations have nearly doubled in the last two years, with a $1 billion modernization plan set to kick off in 2019.  Perks: More than $1 billion in public aid from the state, according to The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Other: Known for its arts scene and food boom, Pittsburgh is also developing a reputation as a tech hub. Uber has tested autonomous vehicles on the city's streets, though the experiments have caused some conflict. Duolingo, a popular language app, is based there. Apple, Google and Facebook also have offices in the area. Population: 458,000 in the city and 1.3 million in the metropolitan area. Schools: Raleigh is home to North Carolina State University and is within a half-hour drive of Durham's Duke University and Chapel Hill's flagship campus of the University of North Carolina. Transit: The airport serves a handful of international destinations, and voters recently approved a transportation tax to improve roads. There is bus service but no commuter rail. Perks: City officials declined to discuss incentives. Population: 2.7 million in the city and 6.2 million in the metropolitan area, according to Canadian census data from 2016. Schools: The University of Toronto and the University of Waterloo are considered two of the best engineering schools in Canada; York University is also a highly regarded institution. Transit: It is possible to fly from Toronto's Pearson or Billy Bishop airport to Boston, Chicago, New York and Washington within 90 minutes.  Perks: No billion-dollar subsidies here, only reasonable incentives, according to a report from CBC. Other: Google last year opened an artificial intelligence lab in the city, which is considered one of the places on the cutting edge of A.I. research. (One of Google's corporate siblings has bigger ambitions there.) Toronto's official proposal stresses its embrace of immigrants, noting that 51 percent of the city's residents come from outside Canada. Population: 681,170 in the city and 6.1 million in the metropolitan area. Schools: Georgetown University, George Washington University, Howard University and American University are among the schools in the district. Transit: Navigating Beltway traffic is challenging, but the Metro system, despite declines in service and ridership, makes it possible to get around the city and to Ronald Reagan Washington National and Washington Dulles Airports.  Perks: Washington offered Amazon a zero-percent corporate tax rate for five years, and an exemption from state sales taxes on hardware and software, according to records obtained by WAMU, a public radio station. The city proposed four neighborhoods as Amazon locations: the Anacostia River around Nationals Park and the new D.C. United soccer stadium; behind Union Station; south of R.F.K. Stadium; and around the U Street and Shaw neighborhoods. Other: Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, bought the city's biggest mansion in 2016, for $23 million in cash. Zach Wichter contributed reporting."
4,2018-01-18," (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good evening. Here's the latest. 1. NASA declared 2017 Earth's second-warmest year on record. And here's the surprising part: Last year had no El Niño, the shift in tropical Pacific weather patterns that contributed to record highs the previous two years. It was actually a La Niña year, the opposite phenomenon. ""This is the new normal,"" a NASA official said. Above, a dam near Cape Town, which is experiencing a drought so severe that it could run out of water by April. ____ 2. President Trump contradicted his chief of staff, John Kelly, above, who said on Wednesday that the president's campaign promise to build a border wall was not ""fully informed."" ""The Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it,"" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. And there was confusion over Mr. Trump's tweets on another subject: negotiations to avoid a government shutdown. The House passed a stopgap bill to keep the government open late Thursday, but Senate Democrats appear ready to block it. ____ 3. In other White House news: President Trump was in western Pennsylvania to shore up support for Rick Saccone, a Republican candidate for the House. The administration announced new steps to protect health workers who have religious or moral objections to performing abortions or sex-change operations. And our editorial board stayed quiet today, dedicating its space in print to letters from Trump supporters. ____ 4. Amazon whittled contenders for its second headquarters down to 20 from 238, mostly in the Midwest and on the East Coast. The company, based in Seattle, says the move will bring 50,000 high-paying jobs. Many of the finalists, like Dallas, Denver, Raleigh, N.C., and Washington, were considered shoo-ins from the start. But there were unexpected ones too, including Indianapolis, above; Columbus, Ohio; Miami; and Nashville. ____ 5. Dylan Farrow went on TV to again accuse her father, Woody Allen, of molesting her as a child, telling ""CBS This Morning"": ""I want to show my face and tell my story."" Prosecutors in Pennsylvania asked the judge handling Bill Cosby's retrial on sexual assault charges to allow testimony from 19 additional women who say Mr. Cosby assaulted them. And the Olympic gold medalist McKayla Maroney said that sexual abuse by Lawrence Nassar, the former doctor for the national women's gymnastics team, left ""scars"" on her psyche ""that may never go away."" ____ 6. The California parents accused of holding captive their 13 children were charged with torture and abuse. They could face life sentences. The district attorney said that many of the children appeared to have cognitive delays and showed evidence of nerve damage from ""extreme and prolonged physical abuse."" The authorities said the couple wouldn't let the children eat, shower or stay awake during the day, and shackled them for months as punishment. Above, the couple, David and Louise Turpin, renewing their vows in Las Vegas in 2011. ____ 7. An intricate boat ballet plays out each January on the frigid waters of the northern Great Lakes. Huge freighters scramble to make deliveries before the Soo Locks, which connect Lake Superior to points south and east, shut down for the coldest stretch of winter. Our team chronicled the dance in text, photos and video. ____ 8. This year's flu season is ""moderately severe."" That's the word from our reporter who specializes ""in plagues and pestilences."" (Really, that's in his official bio.) Here's what you need to know: Large numbers of Americans are sick, with widespread flu activity in every state but Hawaii. But the number of people hospitalized or dying is not unusually high. And no, it's not too late to get a flu shot. Above, a triage tent for flu patients at a hospital in Loma Linda, Calif. ____ 9. New research shows that 86 percent of American women in their early 40s are mothers, a sizable jump from a decade ago. The rise was especially steep among unmarried women and those with advanced degrees. Above, a baby named Emma, born from a frozen embryo last year. In related news, we launched a new animated video series, Conception, based on hundreds of responses from readers about the experience of motherhood. In the first episode, we hear from a woman who raised a son alone after her activist husband was killed in El Salvador. ____ 10. Finally, Samantha Bee fiercely defended the #MeToo movement amid signs of a growing backlash. She weighed in on the claims against Aziz Ansari, and she argued that it was time to set a higher standard for sex. ""And women get to talk about it if men don't live up to those standards,"" she added. ""Especially if that man wrote a book about how to sex good.""

5,2018-01-18," Good Thursday. Here's what we're watching: • Twenty cities made it to the next round in Amazon's search for its second headquarters. • Morgan Stanley reported $686 million in fourth-quarter profit, while fixed-income trading revenue fell 46 percent. • What to think of Apple's big cash repatriation. • How Goldman Sachs stumbled. Want this in your own email inbox? Here's the sign-up. In fact, 20 cities — out of 238 applicants — have made it into the next round to host Amazon's second headquarters. From Amazon's news release: Notably not on the list: Detroit, which has become a poster child for reviving American industrial cities and which promised a lot to win over Amazon. More from Nick Wingfield of the NYT: Other observations • Three locations — Washington, Montgomery County, Md. and Northern Virginia — are all part of the Washington DC corridor, where Jeff Bezos has been spending more time lately. • The smallest city is Newark, N.J., whose estimated 2016 population in 2016 was 281,764. • This: • Also, this: — Michael J. de la Merced As it repatriates most of its $252 billion cash hoard from foreign subsidiaries, Apple has become a triumphant example for Republicans of what the new tax law can do. President Trump's reaction: Perhaps more important than the one-time $38 billion that Apple will pay in tax is what said it would do with the rest of the money: 20,000 jobs and a new domestic campus, among other initiatives. Tim Cook said in a statement: The big question: How much of an economic effect will this have? The company says more than $350 billion over the next five years, but how much of that goes beyond what it would have spent anyway is unclear. (For starters, its new campus won't be as ambitious as Amazon's planned HQ2.) The tax flyaround • Verizon will save nearly $17 billion because of the new tax code's effect on its deferred tax liabilities. (WSJ) • What corporate America says will come of the tax overhaul: more annual savings, bigger pension contributions and larger stock buybacks. (WSJ) Mick Mulvaney, the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, is continuing his efforts to rein in the agency. His latest tactic: starve it of cash, reports the NYT's Stacey Cowley. Here's what he did: • The consumer bureau is funded directly by the Federal Reserve. Each quarter the watchdog requests money for its operations from the central bank. • On Wednesday, Mr. Mulvaney requested $0 for the current quarter. • Mr. Mulvaney said the bureau is sitting on a $177.1 million reserve fund. He plans to use that to cover the bureau's projected quarterly expenses of $145 million. While the move is largely symbolic, it follows other recent moves by Mr. Mulvaney that spotlight the Trump administration's desire to shift the consumer bureau's trajectory. Ignore all the one-time charges related to the new tax law that banks announced this week, the industry, long-term, should be among the biggest winners. But how much of the windfall will end in the pockets of employees and customers? Since the tax overhaul became law last month, banks have rushed to shower employees with bonuses and raises. Yet despite this largess, ""the industry stands to retain more than 75 percents of the savings"" from the tax law, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. In fact, the total cost of the wage increases and bonuses ""will amount to just 1.75 percent of the banking industry's noninterest expenses in 2018."" Morgan Stanley reported a profit of $686 million, including a one-time charge on $990 million related to the new tax law. The Numbers • 84 cents. Morgan Stanley's earnings per share excluding the tax charge. Wall Street expected the firm to report earnings of 77 cents a share. • $9.5 billion. The bank's fourth-quarter revenue, up 5.3 percent from a year ago. • $37.9 billion. Morgan Stanley's full-year revenue, up 10 percent from 2016. By comparison, the firm's five rivals reported revenue rose 2 percent and 5 percent, the WSJ pointed out. • $808 million. The firm's revenue from fixed-income trading, down 45 percent from a year ago. It marked the first time in two years revenue in the division failed to reach $1 billion. Still, the decline was not as severe as Goldman's. Morgan Stanley's longtime rival reported a 50 percent drop in fixed-income trading revenue. • $1.92 billion. Morgan Stanley's fourth-quarter equity trading revenue, off 2 percent from a year ago. • $522 million. The bank's fourth-quarter advisory revenue, down 6 percent ""on lower levels of completed M&A activity."" Goldman reported 9 percent decline in advisory revenue. Shares of Morgan Stanley gained 1.5 percent in early trading and are up 29 percent over the past year. Yes, stock's are down a bit Thursday, but that doesn't obscure the fact that major equity indexes are off to their best start in years. Wednesday, shares of the Dow Jones industrial average closed above 26,000, the Standard & Poor's 500 index finished above 2,800, and the Nasdaq Composite surpassed its inflation-adjusted peak from the dot-com boom. Investors have piled into stocks to start 2018. It took the Dow industrials just eight trading sessions to go from 25,000 to 26,000, the fastest move between millennial markers on record. So far this month, the S. & P. 500 has risen about 4.8 percent this month. To put that into context, the last time the index climbed 5 percent in January was 2013 and the last 6 percent gain for the month was in 1997. In both years, equities went on the finish the year up more than 30 percent, according to Instinet's Frank Cappelleri. So what could derail the stock market's rally? A government shutdown? Escalating tensions with North Korea? Right now neither is weighing on stocks very much. In fact, MoneyBeat's Ben Eisen points out that downward pressure, by one measure, is at its lowest level in 50 years. Most of its businesses did well in the fourth quarter. Then there was fixed-income trading. Though Goldman's $1.9 billion loss for the fourth quarter was because of a $4.4 billion charge related to the new tax law, the big number was 50 percent. That was how much its so-called FICC (fixed-income, currency and commodities) trading revenue had fallen. Put another way: Goldman's FICC revenue for the quarter was $1 billion — the amount the division brought in nearly every two weeks at its peak. Critics' corner • Lex suggests that Goldman now ""wants to execute more perfunctory corporate transactions of a kind traditionally handled by Bank of America and its ilk."" (FT) • Aaron Back writes of a dip in Goldman's share price, ""Any near-term weakness could prove to be a buying opportunity."" (Heard on the Street) On David Solomon's wine collection You may already know Goldman's co-president as a top-flight investment banker with a taste for fine food. (And almost definitely as DJ D-Sol.) But he's also allegedly the victim of wine theft by his former assistant, Nicolas De-Meyer, who was arrested this week. Worth noting: • Among the stolen wines were seven bottles of Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, a Burgundy known as ""liquid velvet,"" that had cost him $133,650. • Overall, the value of the stolen bottles was over $1.2 million. • The wine storage area in Mr. Solomon's Manhattan home can hold 1,000 bottles. What's next: House Republicans plan to introduce a short-term funding bill today or tomorrow to keep the government operating for a month. But it's unclear whether Democrats would back it without a deal on immigration, or if House Republicans have the votes to pass it on their own. How close lawmakers are to an immigration compromise: Not very. Here's Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, quoted in the WSJ about the current state of affairs: More on immigration: John Kelly, the White House chief of staff, told Democratic lawmakers that some of Mr. Trump's immigration policies — including the border wall — were ""uninformed,"" according to the WaPo. Mr. Kelly also reiterated that the president supported permanent legal protection for the young immigrants known as Dreamers. The Washington flyaround • Steve Bannon will be interviewed by Robert Mueller's investigators instead of testifying before a grand jury, according to an unidentified person, signaling that he's cooperating. (NYT) • A White House lawyer had asked Mr. Bannon to assert executive privilege before the House Intelligence Committee. Mr. Bannon slipped up. (Bloomberg, Axios) • Two news stories this week offered more details about a purported relationship between Mr. Trump and a porn star professionally known as Stormy Daniels. (NYT) The Dow Jones industrial average is on a sprint again, closing yesterday above 26,000 for the first time. Naturally, some people are starting to worry. From Corrie Driebusch, Michael Wursthorn and Chris Dieterich of the WSJ: Pimco is in the same boat: This post on what may be next for Alwaleed bin Talal by Jeffrey Towson, a professor at Peking University and a former employee of the prince's Kingdom Holding, has started to circulate around the financial world.

6,2018-01-18," SEATTLE — Like a college applicant waiting for that special message in the mail, officials in Boston got what they wanted on Thursday: a cryptic four-sentence note informing them that the city made the finals in its bid to host Amazon's second headquarters. ""We would like to move Boston forward in the process so we can continue to learn more about your community, your talent, and potential real estate options,"" Holly Sullivan, an Amazon executive, wrote in the note. ""Please email me back with available times for a call so we can discuss next steps."" Boston was one of 20 places in the United States and Canada that made Amazon's list, joining cities that had been widely expected to make the cut, like Denver and Dallas, and surprises like Nashville and Columbus, Ohio. The winner could get up to 50,000 high-paying jobs and $5 billion in investment, figures that Amazon has dangled in front of local officials, setting off an unprecedented competition to be the second home for one of the internet's mightiest companies. In all, 238 cities and regions applied to bring the company to town, many using promises of tax breaks and public charm offensives to gain favor with the e-commerce giant. The finalists include places like Newark, where the local economy has struggled for decades, and hip centers like Miami and Austin, Tex. For other cities, like Los Angeles and New York, luring Amazon would cement their place as centers of the tech industry. The other finalists are Atlanta; Chicago; Indianapolis; Montgomery County, Md.; Northern Virginia; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Raleigh, N.C.; Washington and Toronto — the only one outside the United States. Officials from the 20 locations celebrated their selections and, in most cases, reiterated their pitches for why Amazon should ultimately pick them. Ras Baraka, mayor of Newark, said Amazon would have ""a tremendous social and economic impact on this city, state and region by coming to Newark."" Kathleen Wynne, the premier of Ontario, the province where Toronto is located, reacted with what could be perceived as a dig at her American competitors. Toronto was the ""obvious choice"" for Amazon, in part because of Canada's universal health care system and its openness to immigrants, she said. ""We are already welcoming the best and brightest talent from around the world — no matter where you come from, you are welcome and you will feel at home in Ontario,"" Ms. Wynne said. Many of the cities selected had been considered shoo-ins from the moment Amazon announced the search in September, largely because they closely matched the attributes that the company said it wanted in a second home, which it is calling HQ2. Those criteria included a metropolitan area with a population greater than one million and the ability to attract and keep strong technical talent. But there were several surprise snubs, too. Amazon rejected applications from Detroit, Phoenix and San Diego, plus all the bids from Mexico. The list leaned east, away from the tech-saturated hubs of the West Coast. ""Getting from 238 to 20 was very tough — all the proposals showed tremendous enthusiasm and creativity,"" Ms. Sullivan, Amazon's head of economic development, said in a statement. ""Through this process we learned about many new communities across North America that we will consider as locations for future infrastructure investment and job creation."" Amazon shrouded its selection process in secrecy. On Thursday, the company said little about how it had pared down the list, other than to say it based its choices on the criteria it laid out for the search earlier. The process was conducted by a team of about a dozen people within Amazon, including economists, human resources managers and executives who oversee real estate, according to people briefed on the process who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deliberations were private. Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive who was the mastermind behind turning the search into a public process and coined the term ""HQ2,"" was also involved, the people said. The veil of secrecy kept even the finalist cities in the dark until Thursday's announcement. Muriel Bowser, the mayor of Washington, was on her way into the office when a deputy mayor called and said that the city had made the Top 20. ""I was, of course, pleased, but not that surprised because we know that Washington, D.C., matches what Amazon is looking for,"" Ms. Bowser said. Hans Riemer, president of the Montgomery County Council, found out from a friend via text message. ""My heart skipped a beat,"" he said. The process will now shift into a new phase, with Amazon representatives communicating more directly with the finalist cities as they prepare to select a winner later this year — and perhaps with cities being even more outspoken about why they should be chosen. Emissaries from Amazon are expected to visit the finalist locations in person. Some of the finalists are neighbors, setting up what are likely to be intense regional rivalries. Ms. Bowser said Amazon's selection of Montgomery County and Northern Virginia — both near Washington — spoke to the appeal of the region's work force. ""Of course,"" she added, ""we believe that Washington, D.C. — with our top talent and world-class amenities — is the right place for Amazon HQ2."" Mayor Baraka said that Newark has a ""friendly rivalry"" with its bigger neighbor, New York, while adding that his city enjoys the advantages of cheaper real estate, space for development in its downtown and lots of fiber optic network capacity. Amazon needs a second headquarters because it's bursting at the seams in its hometown, Seattle. Mr. Bezos founded the company there in 1994, and it has since transformed the city, employing more than 40,000 there. That expansion has also contributed to Seattle's soaring cost of living and its traffic woes. To lure applicants, Amazon showered local politicians with its own data about the effect the company has had on the Seattle economy, and some of the immediate economic benefits its second home would experience — including $5 billion in construction spending. It asked candidates to include in their bids a variety of detailed information, including potential building sites, crime and traffic stats and nearby recreational opportunities. Amazon also asked cities and states to describe the tax incentives available to offset its costs for building and operating its second headquarters. The most eye-popping of those offers was New Jersey's promise of up to $7 billion in tax incentives to bring Amazon to Newark. Another tech giant, Apple, this week said it, too, was hunting for a location to build a major new campus. But the company's chief executive, Tim Cook, said it would not conduct a public bidding process akin to Amazon's. He said California and Texas were unlikely locations for the new campus because Apple already has significant operations there. Amazon's search process has also attracted critics. Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit organization that serves as an advocate for local businesses, said that politicians were enhancing Amazon's image just as the company's market power was under growing scrutiny from groups like her own. ""As these cities woo and grovel, they are basically communicating this idea that we should want Amazon to be bigger and more powerful in our economy,"" Ms. Mitchell said. Ed Glaeser, a professor of economics at Harvard who studies cities, predicted that the winner of the contest would have in place the kind of positive economic attributes that mean it wouldn't necessarily need Amazon to thrive. ""At its best, the competition for Amazon has spurred cities to think about how to improve their quality of life more generally,"" he said. ""At its worst, the competition has become a distraction and a contest for throwing cash at the giant."""
7,2018-01-18," Good morning.  Here's what you need to know: • North and South Korea's sudden solidarity over the Winter Olympics has complicated the longstanding White House strategy of pressuring the North with sanctions and threats of military action. And it comes as the world's confidence in America's leadership has hit a new low. Just 30 percent of people interviewed in 134 countries last year approved of U.S. leadership, a drop of nearly 20 percentage points since President Obama's final year. The U.S. is now behind China, and barely ahead of Russia. The survey concluded that Mr. Trump's foreign policy and his words ""have sowed doubt about the U.S. commitment to its partners abroad."" Above, President Moon Jae-in with the South Korean ice hockey teams. _____ • President Trump upset a Republican plan to keep the government open past Friday when he said an extension of the popular Children's Health Insurance Program should not be part of a stopgap spending bill. Mr. Trump further complicated the shutdown calculus by contradicting his own chief of staff, John Kelly, who told lawmakers that the president's campaign promise to build a border wall with Mexico was not ""fully informed."" ""The Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it,"" he wrote on Twitter. _____ • China's economy grew 6.9 percent last year, its first acceleration in seven years as exports, construction and consumer spending all climbed strongly. At least, as our Shanghai bureau chief points out, that's what the government says. In reality, the pace of growth in the world's second largest economy is anybody's guess. Various signals suggest China's growth did speed up last year, but its official figures are at times implausibly smooth and steady. _____ • Earth's long-term warming trend continued in 2017, with NASA declaring it the second warmest year on record, even without El Niño, which helped make 2016 the hottest recorded yet. Overall, as this interactive graphic shows, global temperatures have increased more than 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 19th century. To avoid the worst consequences of climate change, scientists warn that temperatures must not increase more than 2 degrees Celsius. Climate change is being felt in geopolitics, too. A water crisis — whether caused by nature, human mismanagement, or both — can be an early warning signal of conflict. Iran is the latest example. _____ • And Novak Djokovic defeated Gaël Monfils in a scorcher at the Australian Open. The temperature on the court felt like 68 degrees Celsius (154 Fahrenheit), according to Australian television, and Mr. Djokovic called the conditions ""brutal.""

Long before the world got hooked on ""Game of Thrones,"" ""I Love Lucy"" was almost unprecedented in popularity — and daring in content for the time. Lucy was one of the first pregnant characters shown on U.S. television, and  44 million viewers tuned to CBS 65 years ago today to see Lucille Ball's character become a mother. (Lucy gave birth to Ricky on the air the same night, it turns out, that Ms. Ball gave birth to her second child.) Audience numbers like that episode's have since been far surpassed — the Super Bowl, for instance, has drawn more than 100 million viewers for each of the past eight years. But almost 72 percent of TVs in the U.S. were tuned in to ""I Love Lucy"" that day, an astonishing feat. According to Nielsen's, the final episode of ""M*A*S*H,"" in 1983, had the highest rating of any  fictional show in U.S.  history, 125 million. But few shows can rival the positive response that the ""I Love Lucy"" birth episode, and the arrival of Ms. Ball's second child, elicited. ""One million viewers responded with congratulatory telephone calls, telegrams, letters or gifts,"" The Times noted in Ms. Ball's obituary in 1989.

0,2018-01-19," Each Friday, Farhad Manjoo, technology columnist at The New York Times, reviews the week's news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here. Good morning, readers! It was an interesting week in the tech world. Let's get to the news. One thread in the yearlong backlash against the tech industry concerns inequality. Many tech giants are built on scale — the idea that they can serve billions of customers while employing far fewer people than corporate giants of yore. Those dynamics are good for business, but they don't make for great optics. There's a danger that tech C.E.O.s come to be seen as out-of-touch coastal elites. Well, they want you to know they aren't. Amazon is so all-in on America that it wants to open another headquarters here; on Thursday, the company announced the 20 cities that made its cut as possible locations. There's one city in Canada — Toronto — and several coastal enclaves (New York, Washington, Los Angeles), but there's oh-so-much Middle America here, too. Wherever it ends up is, at this point, almost beside the point; Amazon has won so much positive coverage from the selection process that it can already count the story as a big win. Meanwhile, in its own very well-designed press release, Apple announced this week that it would bring a historic pile of cash back to America. The company has about $270 billion in cash, but it had parked most of it overseas for tax reasons. Under the new tax code signed into law last year by President Trump, Apple said, it will pay $38 billion in taxes on that money — the largest tax bill ever paid — and invest billions in new facilities and people in the United States. The company is also giving many of its employees a $2,500 bonus. Apple's announcement made Trump very happy. And the president's victory lap is, I think, somewhat deserved. Trump and the tech industry have not had the warmest relationship, but it's clear that his campaign — in which he constantly harangued Apple and Amazon for perceived slights — has shaken the industry from its presumption that everyone in the country loves it. Just a few weeks ago, people brave enough to enter the market for Bitcoin and its many rival electronic currencies looked like lucky geniuses. They were suddenly making millions, even billions — and you were kicking yourself for overlooking the crypto boom. Well, now you're the genius (if still poor). Much of the cryptocurrency market took a bath this week, with Bitcoin falling below $10,000 at one point, more than 50 percent off its December peak. Reddit was flooded with panicked crypto lovers, but, as it usually does, the market leveled off by the end of the week, and crypto-heads were professing to be back on board for the long haul. Godspeed, I guess. There wasn't so much else in tech news this week, so take some time to read some great magazine stories. In Bloomberg Businessweek, Eric Newcomer and Brad Stone have a dishy inside look at how Travis Kalanick, Uber's co-founder and former hard-charging C.E.O., fell from grace. Among the details: During one harrowing Kalanick-caused scandal, he fell to ""his hands and knees and began squirming on the floor."" Also, Steven Johnson has a fascinating piece in The New York Times Magazine about the uses for the blockchain, the technology undergirding cryptocurrencies.

1,2018-01-19," OTTAWA — John Tory, the mayor of the only city outside the United States to make the list of 20 finalists for Amazon's second headquarters displayed some typical Canadian modesty on Thursday. Toronto, Mr. Tory said, had only ""made the playoffs."" But regardless of the outcome, the announcement that the city remains a contender showed how much progress Toronto, and the surrounding region, have made in establishing themselves as a major technology center. Nine communities in the Toronto region put forward a joint bid for the headquarters. Those towns are already home to a major Google engineering operation, a major artificial intelligence research center and a quantum computing institute. General Motors is adding about 1,000 software engineers to the area who will, among other things, develop systems for self-driving cars, and Thomson Reuters has made Toronto a technology hub, a move that could create 1,500 jobs. And a unit of Google's parent company, Alphabet, is developing plans to turn a derelict portion of Toronto's waterfront into a high-tech city of the future. Amazon offered few details on Thursday about how it had come up with its 20 finalists. Unlike several other finalists, the region offered no tax or other incentives. But Mr. Tory said he believed that the area had two important virtues. One is Canada's immigration policy. Mr. Tory said that when he was recently in New York, he found a great deal of interest among American executives in Canada's relatively new immigration program that gives visas to certain skilled workers within two weeks. That's light speed compared with the complicated American system. And unlike the United States, Canada does not limit how many of those visas can be issued each year. In sharp contrast to President Trump's efforts to limit the entry of people from some predominately Muslim countries into the United States, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has repeatedly emphasized that Canada is open to people of all religions and backgrounds. ""We're able to attract the best and the brightest from around the world,"" Mr. Tory said. Toronto's second asset, he said, is its publicly funded university and college system. The University of Waterloo has long been recognized as one of North America's top technology schools, and the University of Toronto is a major center for research in artificial intelligence. As part of the area's Amazon pitch, the province of Ontario has increased funding for artificial intelligence programs at its universities by 30 million Canadian dollars, or about $24 million. ""We have a talent pool, and we have the educational policies to make sure the pipeline is full,"" Mr. Tory said. But the Toronto area also has a potentially unattractive feature: ever-escalating prices both for homes and for commercial real estate. Its bid proposes several potential sites for Amazon's second headquarters, among them the largely abandoned docklands that include the Google-related redevelopment plan. Frank Scarpitti, the mayor of Markham, Ontario, which is already home to operations of IBM and the chip maker AMD, dismissed the idea that land and housing prices could be a deal breaker. He noted that several other finalists, including New York, had similar or higher costs. Soon after the announcement, Kathleen Wynne, the premier of Ontario, appointed Ed Clark, the former president and chief executive of the Toronto-Dominion Bank, to coordinate the province's reply. Mr. Tory said the cities would probably have to wait for Amazon's next move before taking any action of their own. ""We don't know what they're expecting from us,"" he said. ""There has been no playbook or playoff schedule supplied to the 20 finalists."""
2,2018-01-19," PUERTO MALDONADO, Peru — In this sweltering Amazonian city, Pope Francis on Friday gave a stirring defense of the region's indigenous people, whose lands and way of life are threatened by industry and government, leaving almost no institutions to protect them. It was a departure from an otherwise purely religious visit to Peru, where Francis arrived on Thursday from Chile, but it fit squarely within his advocacy for environmental preservation. Facing a crowded sports arena — where the main stage was neatly divided between clerics sitting on chairs and indigenous people in traditional garments sitting on the ground — Francis said he understood the local challenges. He deplored, on one hand, ""the pressure being exerted by great business interests that want to lay hands on its petroleum, gas, lumber, gold and forms of agro-industrial monocultivation"" and, on the other hand, threats from policies that ostensibly aim to conserve land ""without taking into account"" its inhabitants. He also criticized those who call indigenous rights a ""hindrance"" to economic development. ""The fact is, your lives cry out against a style of life that is oblivious to its own real cost,"" he said. The speech resonated with indigenous leaders here, who have expressed hopes that the papal visit would finally cast a spotlight on their plight. But they also asked why indigenous leaders had been left to stand on the sidelines. ""It's incoherent, it's contradictory, to have an event to show the world the problems of the indigenous people and not let their principal authorities speak,"" said Julio Cusurichi, a native Shipibo and president of the Federation of Natives of the Madre de Dios River and Its Tributaries, or Fenamad. ""We are again expected to be subdued by the Church?"" asked Edwin Vásquez, who leads the Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin, or Coica, an umbrella group. ""I'm Catholic, I believe in God, but I've learned not to trust priests."" Mr. Vasquez and Mr. Cusurichi, among the most prominent indigenous leaders here, said they had been denied, at the last minute, a chance to address the pope. (Mr. Cusurichi gave Francis a present, but did not speak.) ""We're scared because people who are from other places want our people to disappear,"" said Luis Miguel Tayori, an indigenous man who spoke at the event. The pope's visit has overwhelmed Puerto Maldonado. The stadium had capacity for 100,000 attendees, more than  the city's total population. The city was closed to traffic, forcing everyone to commute to events on foot. More than 2,500 police officers dotted almost every corner of the city. Hundreds more were dispatched from other cities. Small and remote, Puerto Maldonado seemed an unlikely candidate for a papal visit. Unlike Peru's bigger cities, its history does not trace to the Andean nation's colonial past, when Spaniards urbanized and evangelized at the same time. But Puerto Maldonado represents the gateway to two bluntly contradictory worlds that sit within Francis' interests. The city provides access to pristine rain forest, jungle lodges and biodiversity research stations, but it is also the entry point to a 21st century gold rush that has not only eroded trees and rivers but also the rule of law. From above, the mined areas look like orange scars piercing a green blanket made of trees. From the ground, the rise of illegal mining in the region has been accompanied by a rise in violent crime and human trafficking, which Francis called a ""devastating assault on life."" Mining also has threatened the territories where indigenous populations live. Tons of mercury, a byproduct of gold mining, have been poured into rivers. ""We the indigenous people are the ones who drink water directly from the rivers and eat its fish,"" Mr. Cusurichi said. ""City dwellers don't do that."" In his message, Francis seemed to agree. ""We have to break with the historical paradigm that views Amazonia as an inexhaustible source of supplies for other countries without concern for its inhabitants,"" he said. Others say mining is facing too much of a stigma in a city that has boomed in the past decade partly because of it. Maria Quispe Ccoca, from Huepetuhe, a town that has come to symbolize the region's gold rush, said she had hoped the pope would strike a conciliatory note without demonizing miners. ""We need peace, reconciliation, especially in the far-flung towns of our Amazon jungle,"" said Ms. Quispe Ccoca, who traveled to Puerto Maldonado to see Francis. But indigenous leaders say they have had enough. ""We need a proper indigenous economy that is based on a sustainable use of the rain forest,"" Mr. Vásquez said. ""We need an alternative to hell, and hell is mining."""

In sharp contrast to President Trump's efforts to limit the entry of people from some predominately Muslim countries into the United States, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has repeatedly emphasized that Canada is open to people of all religions and backgrounds. ""We're able to attract the best and the brightest from around the world,"" Mr. Tory said. Toronto's second asset, he said, is its publicly funded university and college system. The University of Waterloo has long been recognized as one of North America's top technology schools, and the University of Toronto is a major center for research in artificial intelligence. As part of the area's Amazon pitch, the province of Ontario has increased funding for artificial intelligence programs at its universities by 30 million Canadian dollars, or about $24 million. ""We have a talent pool, and we have the educational policies to make sure the pipeline is full,"" Mr. Tory said. But the Toronto area also has a potentially unattractive feature: ever-escalating prices both for homes and for commercial real estate. Its bid proposes several potential sites for Amazon's second headquarters, among them the largely abandoned docklands that include the Google-related redevelopment plan. Frank Scarpitti, the mayor of Markham, Ontario, which is already home to operations of IBM and the chip maker AMD, dismissed the idea that land and housing prices could be a deal breaker. He noted that several other finalists, including New York, had similar or higher costs. Soon after the announcement, Kathleen Wynne, the premier of Ontario, appointed Ed Clark, the former president and chief executive of the Toronto-Dominion Bank, to coordinate the province's reply. Mr. Tory said the cities would probably have to wait for Amazon's next move before taking any action of their own. ""We don't know what they're expecting from us,"" he said. ""There has been no playbook or playoff schedule supplied to the 20 finalists."""
5,2018-01-19," PUERTO MALDONADO, Peru — In this sweltering Amazonian city, Pope Francis on Friday gave a stirring defense of the region's indigenous people, whose lands and way of life are threatened by industry and government, leaving almost no institutions to protect them. It was a departure from an otherwise purely religious visit to Peru, where Francis arrived on Thursday from Chile, but it fit squarely within his advocacy for environmental preservation. Facing a crowded sports arena — where the main stage was neatly divided between clerics sitting on chairs and indigenous people in traditional garments sitting on the ground — Francis said he understood the local challenges. He deplored, on one hand, ""the pressure being exerted by great business interests that want to lay hands on its petroleum, gas, lumber, gold and forms of agro-industrial monocultivation"" and, on the other hand, threats from policies that ostensibly aim to conserve land ""without taking into account"" its inhabitants. He also criticized those who call indigenous rights a ""hindrance"" to economic development. ""The fact is, your lives cry out against a style of life that is oblivious to its own real cost,"" he said. The speech resonated with indigenous leaders here, who have expressed hopes that the papal visit would finally cast a spotlight on their plight. But they also asked why indigenous leaders had been left to stand on the sidelines. ""It's incoherent, it's contradictory, to have an event to show the world the problems of the indigenous people and not let their principal authorities speak,"" said Julio Cusurichi, a native Shipibo and president of the Federation of Natives of the Madre de Dios River and Its Tributaries, or Fenamad. ""We are again expected to be subdued by the Church?"" asked Edwin Vásquez, who leads the Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin, or Coica, an umbrella group. ""I'm Catholic, I believe in God, but I've learned not to trust priests."" Mr. Vasquez and Mr. Cusurichi, among the most prominent indigenous leaders here, said they had been denied, at the last minute, a chance to address the pope. (Mr. Cusurichi gave Francis a present, but did not speak.) ""We're scared because people who are from other places want our people to disappear,"" said Luis Miguel Tayori, an indigenous man who spoke at the event. The pope's visit has overwhelmed Puerto Maldonado. The stadium had capacity for 100,000 attendees, more than  the city's total population. The city was closed to traffic, forcing everyone to commute to events on foot. More than 2,500 police officers dotted almost every corner of the city. Hundreds more were dispatched from other cities. Small and remote, Puerto Maldonado seemed an unlikely candidate for a papal visit. Unlike Peru's bigger cities, its history does not trace to the Andean nation's colonial past, when Spaniards urbanized and evangelized at the same time. But Puerto Maldonado represents the gateway to two bluntly contradictory worlds that sit within Francis' interests. The city provides access to pristine rain forest, jungle lodges and biodiversity research stations, but it is also the entry point to a 21st century gold rush that has not only eroded trees and rivers but also the rule of law. From above, the mined areas look like orange scars piercing a green blanket made of trees. From the ground, the rise of illegal mining in the region has been accompanied by a rise in violent crime and human trafficking, which Francis called a ""devastating assault on life."" Mining also has threatened the territories where indigenous populations live. Tons of mercury, a byproduct of gold mining, have been poured into rivers. ""We the indigenous people are the ones who drink water directly from the rivers and eat its fish,"" Mr. Cusurichi said. ""City dwellers don't do that."" In his message, Francis seemed to agree. ""We have to break with the historical paradigm that views Amazonia as an inexhaustible source of supplies for other countries without concern for its inhabitants,"" he said. Others say mining is facing too much of a stigma in a city that has boomed in the past decade partly because of it. Maria Quispe Ccoca, from Huepetuhe, a town that has come to symbolize the region's gold rush, said she had hoped the pope would strike a conciliatory note without demonizing miners. ""We need peace, reconciliation, especially in the far-flung towns of our Amazon jungle,"" said Ms. Quispe Ccoca, who traveled to Puerto Maldonado to see Francis. But indigenous leaders say they have had enough. ""We need a proper indigenous economy that is based on a sustainable use of the rain forest,"" Mr. Vásquez said. ""We need an alternative to hell, and hell is mining."""
6,2018-01-19," SAN FRANCISCO — There were 218 communities whose proposals did not reach the second round in Amazon's well-publicized search for its second headquarters. For those ambitious but unlucky folks, there were no ""thanks for entering"" gift baskets or any consolation prizes. Tom Hall, town manager of Scarborough, Me., had just returned from a meeting about the clam harvest when he heard the bad news from a reporter. He took it philosophically. The town's proposal to convert a 500-acre harness racing track in the center of Scarborough was, he knew, ""the longest of long shots."" In Oklahoma, there were more regrets. ""I'm certainly disappointed,"" said Scott Phillips, who ran a development team called Day 1 that promoted a proposal to build an entirely new 50-square-mile city for Amazon between Oklahoma City and Tulsa, equidistant from each. ""Amazon missed an opportunity to include more out-of-the-box thinking in their list of finalists from proposals like ours,"" he added. For the cities that were not one of Amazon's 20 finalists, that D-word kept coming up. Jim Watson, the mayor of Ottawa, said he was ""disappointed"" twice in a brief interview, adding that the whole process was ""great publicity"" for Amazon. ""This news is certainly disappointing,"" the team that promoted Buffalo and Rochester said in a statement. ""Very disappointed,"" said the Bay Area Council, which had submitted a bid on behalf of San Francisco and four neighboring cities. Amazon's obsessive desire to please its customers has created a fearsome retail juggernaut and made its founder, Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world. This sense of disappointment in the company, however transient it may prove, is something new. Yet it was perhaps inevitable after the way Amazon turned its search for a second headquarters, which it announced in a blaze of publicity in September, into such a beauty contest. Even with unemployment low, the stock market booming and the economy chugging along, the prospect of landing as many as 50,000 high-paying jobs from Amazon aroused the excitement of politicians everywhere. ""When they rolled this idea out, the narrow description they used really only defined about 30 cities,"" said Mr. Phillips of Day 1, referring to how Amazon had said it was looking for a metropolitan area in North America with at least a million people, among other criteria. ""Maybe they truly thought only 30 cities would apply. The fact that 238 did probably caught them off-guard."" Scarborough, for instance, was probably not on Amazon's radar. It is on the Northeast coast, just south of Portland, and has a population of about 20,000. The simplicity of the application process, which involved answering nine questions, providing data and touting the city, ""encouraged us and several hundred others who did not have a viable chance to make the strongest possible argument why it should be us,"" said Mr. Hall, the town manager. ""There's value in thinking and articulating that."" Another factor at play: the sense that Amazon was determined to achieve dominance, so why not join up? ""This new headquarters is merely a stop on their road to global conquest,"" Mr. Hall said. He noted that so many people in Scarborough received goodies from Amazon during the holidays that even now, in the third week of January, the local recycling center was overwhelmed with cardboard packaging. Mr. Hall said he had received ""no word whatsoever"" from Amazon about the fate of his application. An Amazon spokesman said, ""All the cities received direct communication from Amazon, including many personal phone calls."" (Late Thursday, the Scarborough team finally received an email from the company.) Many of the other also-rans did not want to talk. Jason Lary, the mayor of Stonecrest, Ga., who had offered to create a town named Amazon and make Mr. Bezos ""the mayor, C.E.O., king, whatever they want to call it,"" did not return calls. A spokeswoman for Tucson, which had also applied, said, ""We are in an all-day off-site meeting,"" adding that she could not be interviewed. The letdown followed a rush of antics by cities across North America to entice the retailer with tax breaks and publicity stunts. Business leaders in Tucson had tried to mail Amazon a 21-foot cactus, which the company declined. The mayor of Washington posted a video of herself asking her Amazon Alexa where the headquarters should go. (The answer was of course Washington.) Business school students in Philadelphia had a new homework assignment: Write to Amazon asking it to come. Mayors flew out to Seattle to wander the corporate campus. The biggest winner in all this, of course, was Amazon. The search has led to feel-good stories in local papers around the country, a coup for Amazon's public relations machine when many are wary of Mr. Bezos' growing wealth and power. For Art Rolnick, an economist at the University of Minnesota, the selection process — which will continue for months — is ""reality show"" theatrics and should not be celebrated, he said. Amazon, he said, ""wants to get the highest bid and highest subsidy possible, so now the 20 finalist cities will go revise their bids."" ""From a local point of view, it looks like job creation in your community,"" Mr. Rolnick added. ""From a national perspective, it makes no sense."" Some elected officials said the reality-show spectacle was an improvement on the way business is usually done. ""It was like 'The Apprentice,'"" the show about hiring and firing that President Trump starred in, said Tulsa's mayor, G. T. Bynum. ""I loved the process. Amazon, to their credit, made it a public and transparent one. Nine out of 10 times, when we have corporate relocation interest, we have to sign so many nondisclosure agreements we don't even know what company is interested."" Not all the applicants felt the process was transparent. Amazon released the total number of proposals but not where they were from, which caused some latter-day confusion. Mr. Phillips of Day 1 said he had gotten a receipt from Federal Express for delivering his proposal in October and never heard from Amazon after that. One possibility: the company did not take some applications particularly seriously. An Amazon spokesman declined to clarify this point. However clumsy the process, Amazon might have unleashed something. Apple, which has been criticized for doing most of its production in China, announced this week that it would open a new domestic campus. (Apple did not mention a location.) Taking advantage of the new Republican tax plan, which allows a one-time repatriation of cash, Apple signaled it would bring back most of the $252 billion in cash that it held abroad and add 20,000 new jobs in the United States. ""Second headquarters are the thing of the future — the companies are getting too big for a single market,"" said Jeff Cheney, the mayor of Frisco, Tex., a city near Dallas that had a losing bid for Amazon's second headquarters. Beyond any sense of disappointment among the losers, then, was a feeling of expectation. ""If Amazon is not willing to swing for the fences in Oklahoma and build a city, maybe Alibaba"" — the Chinese internet retailer — ""is willing,"" said Mr. Phillips. His efforts to build a corporate city, he said, will continue. There is, however, the problem of the name. ""Day 1"" is a pet expression of Mr. Bezos, symbolizing how his company's opportunities are always right in front of it. ""We'll probably look for a better brand,"" Mr. Phillips said, and then reconsidered. ""If someone wants to take on Amazon, maybe keeping it 'Day 1' will offer the added ability to mess with Bezos' head a little."""
7,2018-01-19,"  (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good morning. Here's what you need to know: • Senate Democrats looked ready to block a stopgap bill that passed the House late Thursday in a bid to keep much of the government running past midnight tonight. The Democrats are intent on securing concessions that would, among other things, protect some young immigrants from deportation. We break down the arguments. The atmosphere has not been helped by a public spat between President Trump and his chief of staff, John Kelly, over the proposed border wall. Our Washington reporters analyze what was perhaps an inevitable clash between two alpha males. • Driving a car into Manhattan could cost $11.52 as the city looks to become the first in the U.S. to introduce traffic charging. Trucks and for-hire vehicles would cost more, but major bridges would stay free under a proposal prepared for Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Fees for taxis and for-hire vehicles could be put in place within a year. New York has resisted pay-to-drive systems in the past, but proponents of the latest plan say it could both ease choked traffic and fund badly needed work on the city's failing transport infrastructure. • The Trump administration is said to be pressing forward with plans to transfer the American Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. Officials had said the move would not happen until the end of President Trump's term, but now it appears the embassy could relocate as early as next year. The acceleration suggests the White House no longer cares about cushioning the blow of the new policy, which has cast Mr. Trump's peacemaking ambitions into doubt. • The Supreme Court temporarily blocked a redistricting effort in North Carolina, making it likely that the midterm elections will be held using district layouts favorable to Republicans. Two other tests of gerrymandering are coming, from Wisconsin and Maryland, and they are likely to effectively decide the North Carolina case. • NASA declared 2017 Earth's second-warmest year on record. The high temperatures surprised scientists, who had expected a sharper retreat from recent record-breaking years. Iran is the latest example of a water crisis — whether caused by nature, mismanagement or both. They're a likely source of future unrest. The parents accused of holding their 13 children captive in California were formally charged with torture and abuse. They could face life in prison. The Riverside County district attorney, Mike Hestrin, said it was one of the most horrific cases of ""human depravity"" he had encountered. • In today's show, Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois discusses how President Trump's racially charged comments led to a showdown over keeping the government open. Listen on a computer, an iOS device or an Android device. •  Amazon has announced a shortlist of 20 cities to host its second headquarters. We look at some of the places that caught its imagination. (There's also a video about the more unusual bids.) • The tax overhaul could set back affordable housing efforts. • The acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has  requested a budget of $0, his latest move to curb the agency. • U.S. stocks were down on Thursday.

In the first episode, meet Laurin. • ""I voted for Donald Trump, and I regret it."" Our editorial board devoted more space today to readers' letters about the Trump administration, including from some disillusioned supporters. • A high-profile pregnancy Jacinda Ardern, 37, who became New Zealand's prime minister in October, said she expected to give birth in June and then take six weeks of parental leave. • Outrage in Oregon Two years after the standoff at the Malheur Refuge, many in the region remain convinced that their way of life is being trampled. • Partisan writing you shouldn't miss Writers from across the political spectrum discuss the potential government shutdown. • It's not all bad out there Here are seven great things we covered this week, including a determined young boy in China and dolphins with mirrors. • For the weekend Our critics recommend 10 new books, including Ali Smith's ""Winter,"" and we profile Mark Epstein, who wrote a slew of popular books on Western and Eastern thought. At the movies, we review ""12 Strong"" and ""Den of Thieves,"" which our critic called a ""surprisingly long, wildly ambitious, thoroughly ludicrous crime thriller."" • Quiz time!

Long before the world got hooked on ""Game of Thrones,"" ""I Love Lucy"" was almost unprecedented in popularity — and daring in content for the time. Lucy was one of the first pregnant characters shown on U.S. television, and 44 million viewers tuned to CBS 65 years ago today to see Lucille Ball's character become a mother. (Lucy gave birth to Ricky on the air the same night that Ms. Ball gave birth to her second child.) That episode's audience numbers have since been far surpassed — the Super Bowl, for instance, has drawn more than 100 million viewers for each of the past eight years. But almost 72 percent of TVs in the U.S. were tuned in to ""I Love Lucy"" that day, an astonishing feat. According to Nielsen, which tracks viewing behavior, the final episode of ""M*A*S*H,"" in 1983, had the highest rating of any fictional show in U.S. history, 125 million. But few shows can rival the positive response that the ""I Love Lucy"" birth episode, and the arrival of Ms. Ball's second child, elicited. ""One million viewers responded with congratulatory telephone calls, telegrams, letters or gifts,"" The Times noted in Ms. Ball's obituary in 1989.

0,2018-01-21," SEATTLE — The first clue that there's something unusual about Amazon's store of the future hits you right at the front door. It feels as if you are entering a subway station. A row of gates guard the entrance to the store, known as Amazon Go, allowing in only people with the store's smartphone app. Inside is an 1,800-square foot mini-market packed with shelves of food that you can find in a lot of other convenience stores — soda, potato chips, ketchup. It also has some food usually found at Whole Foods, the supermarket chain that Amazon owns. But the technology that is also inside, mostly tucked away out of sight, enables a shopping experience like no other. There are no cashiers or registers anywhere. Shoppers leave the store through those same gates, without pausing to pull out a credit card. Their Amazon account automatically gets charged for what they take out the door. On Monday, the store will open to the public for the first time. Gianna Puerini, the executive in charge of Amazon Go, recently gave tours of the store, in downtown Seattle. This is a look at what shoppers will encounter.  There are no shopping carts or baskets inside Amazon Go. Since the checkout process is automated, what would be the point of them anyway? Instead, customers put items directly into the shopping bag they'll walk out with.  Every time customers grab an item off a shelf, Amazon says the product is automatically put into the shopping cart of their online account. If customers put the item back on the shelf, Amazon removes it from their virtual basket.  The only sign of the technology that makes this possible floats above the store shelves — arrays of small cameras, hundreds of them throughout the store. Amazon won't say much about how the system works, other than to say it involves sophisticated computer vision and machine learning software. Translation: Amazon's technology can see and identify every item in the store, without attaching a special chip to every can of soup and bag of trail mix.  There were a little over 3.5 million cashiers in the United States in 2016 — and some of their jobs may be in jeopardy if the technology behind Amazon Go eventually spreads. For now, Amazon says its technology simply changes the role of employees — the same way it describes the impact of automation on its warehouse workers.  ""We've just put associates on different kinds of tasks where we think it adds to the customer experience,"" Ms. Puerini said. Those tasks include restocking shelves and helping customers troubleshoot any technical problems. Store employees mill about ready to help customers find items, and there is a kitchen next door with chefs preparing meals for sale in the store. Because there are no cashiers, an employee sits in the wine and beer section of the store, checking I.D.s before customers can take alcohol off the shelves. Most people who spend any time in a supermarket understand how vexing the checkout process can be, with clogged lines for cashiers and customers who fumble with self-checkout kiosks. At Amazon Go, checking out feels like — there's no other way to put it — shoplifting. It is only a few minutes after walking out of the store, when Amazon sends an electronic receipt for purchases, that the feeling goes away.  Actual shoplifting is not easy at Amazon Go. With permission from Amazon, I tried to trick the store's camera system by wrapping a shopping bag around a $4.35 four-pack of vanilla soda while it was still on a shelf, tucking it under my arm and walking out of the store. Amazon charged me for it. A big unanswered question is where Amazon plans to take the technology. It won't say whether it plans to open more Amazon Go stores, or leave this as a one-of-a-kind novelty. A more intriguing possibility is that it could use the technology inside Whole Foods stores, though Ms. Puerini said Amazon has ""no plans"" to do so.  There's even speculation that Amazon could sell the system to other retailers, much as it sells its cloud computing services to other companies. For now, visitors to Amazon Go may want to watch their purchases: Without a register staring them in the face at checkout, it's easy to overspend. "

Today marks a big step for equality in the entertainment industry. Minnie Mouse is set to finally receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, 90 years after she was introduced and nearly 40 years after Mickey received one. First voiced by Walt Disney himself, the characters made their public debut in the 1928 animated short ""Steamboat Willie."" Minnie went on to appear in more than 60 cartoon shorts, primarily in the 1930s, before becoming a perennial presence on television and at Disney's theme parks around the world. Originally drawn wearing a pillbox hat, Minnie later sported a polka-dot bow on her head that matched her dress. ""Minnie: Style Icon,"" an exhibition at London Fashion Week in 2015, traced her influence over the decades. But she has largely dwelt in Mickey's shadow, the damsel to his leading man. In a 1934 essay titled ""Mickey and Minnie,"" the British novelist E. M.

0,2018-01-23," Tesla's board of directors is driving executive pay into electric dreamland. The board unveiled a pay deal for Elon Musk, the chief executive, on Tuesday that will make him nearly $60 billion if he hits new targets by 2028. That's on top of the $100 billion gain the electric-car pioneer would make on his existing stake. Mr. Musk's new targets are even more ambitious than the 10-year goals from 2012 that he blew through years early. The potential value of share grants totaling 12 percent of the company is vast, but at least the Tesla board has done much more than the usual lip service in setting a serious challenge. It involves Mr. Musk hitting two sets of metrics. First, Tesla's market capitalization has to reach $650 billion — more than 10 times its current level and a valuation that would be fourth among today's publicly listed companies behind Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft, and just ahead of Amazon. Second, he must turbocharge Tesla's financial performance. That requires either growing annual revenue to $175 billion, almost 15 times 2017's expected top line, or making $14 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a figure that may come in at just over $500 million for last year. There are 12 steps along the route to the maximum payout. Reaching the revenue target could mean selling well over 2 million of Tesla's current and planned vehicles, Breakingviews calculates. That level of sales would be in the same ballpark as BMW — and last year's total for Tesla was barely over 100,000 vehicles. That doesn't allow for any surge in the company's solar-panel and electric-storage business, which at present contributes a single-digit percentage to the top line. Still, to get close would require Tesla to dominate the market for electric cars even as General Motors, Nissan and others ramp up their efforts. One model for Musk could be Amazon, whose $177 billion of expected 2017 revenue would mark a 12-fold increase from 2007. Founder Jeff Bezos's stock has surged to 18 times its value a decade ago. Yet at the level that Mr. Musk is now aiming for, financial incentives can lose meaning. With a 20 percent stake already worth $12 billion, hitting his targets may motivate the entrepreneur more powerfully than money."

0,2018-01-25," Among Amazon's 20 finalist cities for its coveted second headquarters are several that would have to be called long shots: Columbus, Ohio, Nashville and Miami, to name three. And then there's Indianapolis. In the frenzy of coverage and speculation that accompanied Amazon's initial announcement of a North America-wide competition for the new headquarters, I couldn't find anyone who cited Indianapolis as a likely finalist. This week the Irish betting site Paddy Power had Indianapolis tied for last among the finalists, with the odds of being chosen at 20 to 1. (Boston and Atlanta have been vying for the best odds, with Boston on top this week at 2 to 1.) The commercial real estate firm CBRE ranked Indianapolis only 33rd among 50 American cities for what CBRE calls ""tech talent."" Amazon has cited access to highly trained and educated technology workers as one of its top priorities. And then there's what might be called the ""cool"" factor — which Indianapolis, at first glance, would seem to be lacking. Bob Stutz, chief executive of Salesforce.com's Marketing Cloud, which is based in Indianapolis, came to the fast-growing company from Microsoft, and lived in Amazon's hometown, Seattle. When Salesforce asked him to move to Indianapolis, his first thought was, ""You've got to be kidding."" But if Mr. Stutz's experience is any indication, the oddsmakers may have to recalculate Indianapolis's chances. Since moving to the city 16 months ago, Mr. Stutz said, he has been ""amazed."" ""Indianapolis has done what may be the best urban redevelopment I've seen in this country,"" he said. ""Everyone here is aligned with making Indianapolis a successful place for technology companies. The people are tremendous, very friendly, polite, with a strong work ethic."" With over 1,700 Salesforce employees there, Indianapolis is now home to the company's second-largest office outside its San Francisco headquarters. In May the company moved into the Salesforce tower in downtown Indianapolis, the tallest building in Indiana, representing a commitment from the company that ""we're here to stay,"" Mr. Stutz said. Salesforce is eager to move more employees to Indianapolis because of its much lower costs and a good quality of life. ""This is one of the few places where you can buy a beautiful home in the city for under $200,000,"" he said. One area where Indianapolis stands out also happens to be one of Amazon's top priorities, according to its proposal: ""A stable and business-friendly environment and tax structure."" Indianapolis may be the most business-friendly city in the country, Mr. Stutz said. Both Indiana's governor, Eric Holcomb, a Republican, and the city's mayor, Joe Hogsett, a Democrat, showed up for the opening of the Salesforce tower, and when it comes to promoting business, partisan gridlock is all but unknown in the state. Both officials ""were very vocal and hands-on and totally bought into this,"" said Michael Huber, chief executive of the Indy Chamber of Commerce, which worked closely with regional and state elected officials, and private sector leaders, to assemble Indianapolis's Amazon proposal. ""That made it so much easier for us."" Neither the city nor the state has said what, if any, tax or other incentives it is offering Amazon. In opening the competition, Amazon also said that ""a strong university system is required."" Indianapolis hardly comes to mind as an academic mecca. But it's the geographic center of ""a surprising number of highly rated schools that are a 45-minute to one-hour drive away,"" said Mark McCoy, the president of DePauw University, a liberal arts college and music school in Greencastle (a 35-minute drive from the Indianapolis airport, and also my alma mater). These include Big Ten members Indiana University and Purdue University, as well as Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, ranked the nation's No. 1 undergraduate engineering program by U.S. News & World Report for 19 consecutive years. Many university faculty members live in or around Indianapolis, ""attracted to a metropolitan area with great cultural opportunities,"" Dr. McCoy said. ""Over 5,000 of our DePauw graduates live in Indianapolis. After they graduate, many of them want to stay."" With a population of 855,000 (ranked 15th among United States cities), in a metropolitan area of more than two million, Indianapolis is larger and more diverse than many people realize. The city has a highly regarded symphony, art museum, ballet and school of ballet, and zoo. It's probably best known as a sports mecca, with the N.B.A. Pacers, W.N.B.A. Fever and N.F.L. Colts. It's the headquarters for the N.C.A.A. and the site of numerous collegiate sports competitions, and it hosted the 2012 Super Bowl. And, of course, it's home to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, site of the Indianapolis 500 auto race. Mr. Stutz lived in Austin, Tex. (another Amazon finalist), before moving to Seattle, and watched its evolution from sleepy state capital to technology hub and hip cultural magnet. ""Austin was never a cool place,"" he said. ""Now it's a hotbed of cool. Indianapolis isn't quite there yet, but I see a lot of similarities."" Last year Bon Appétit magazine devoted a feature to the ""Brooklynization of Indy"" that focused on the city's explosion of craft breweries, artisanal bakeries and farm-to-table restaurants. Transportation facilities are also prominent on Amazon's wish list. The city's light-filled new international airport has been voted the best in North America for five years running by Airports Council International and the best airport in the United States for four years by readers of Condé Nast Traveler. The airport offers multiple direct flights to Seattle, San Francisco, New York, Boston and Washington, and is about to start nonstop service to Paris. Indianapolis's central location and network of interstate highways earned the city its nickname, the Crossroads of America. Amazon is among the large companies with distribution centers there. While Indianapolis lacks subways, light rail or a sophisticated urban transport network, the city is crisscrossed with bike and walking trails. Mr. Stutz said many Salesforce employees biked or walked to work (something Amazon's Seattle employees value). Of the 20 finalist cities, Indianapolis has the least traffic congestion and the lowest average home prices, according to the Chamber of Commerce. That's not to say there aren't high-end options: A 21,000-square-foot, six-bedroom 1930s-era mansion, currently home to the Indiana University chancellor, is on the market for just under $7 million. (It might be perfect for the Amazon chief executive, Jeff Bezos.) For all its virtues, Indianapolis faces a number of hurdles. While Mr. Stutz told me that Salesforce had found an abundance of homegrown tech talent there, Amazon knows it will need to import many of the high-level software engineers and employees who will form the core of the work force at its second headquarters. That may be a challenge. Unlike Amazon's home state of Washington, Indiana reliably votes Republican in presidential elections, though it went for Barack Obama over John McCain in 2008. Donald J. Trump carried the state overwhelmingly in 2016, and Mike Pence, an Indiana native and self-described religious conservative, served as Indiana's governor before becoming Mr. Trump's vice president. A strong streak of social conservatism runs through the state (though not so much in Indianapolis), and this week the state legislature was roiled by a new round in the culture wars as legislators debated whether to pass a hate-crimes bill to protect victims of bias based on race, religion, sex, disability, gender identity or sexual orientation. Indiana is one of only five states without such legislation. Partly as a result of pressure from Salesforce, other companies and the N.C.A.A., Mr. Pence, when he was governor, amended a so-called Religious Freedom Restoration Act in 2015 that had allowed business owners to discriminate against gays and lesbians on the grounds of religious principle. Mr. Huber said the Chamber of Commerce had been a longtime supporter of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, and was a strong supporter of comprehensive anti-hate-crime legislation. The city has had a comprehensive human rights ordinance in place since 2005, he said. Indianapolis may never emerge as the popular favorite to win, but I wouldn't count it out. Maureen Krauss, the chamber's chief economic development officer, who worked on Indianapolis's proposal, said a team of about 300 people had contributed to the first-round effort, and they worked 43 days straight. ""We finished it two days early,"" she said. ""Amazon is a creative company and a tech company, and that's the kind of proposal we tried to deliver."" She and Mr. Huber got the good news that Indianapolis was a finalist on Thursday last week, but there was no celebration. ""We hunkered down and started on Phase 2,"" Mr. Huber said."
1,2018-01-25," Amazon's Alexa voice-controlled virtual assistant is the Chatty Cathy of the tech world, a digital darling that consumers can't get enough of. It can tell chicken jokes, order pizza and turn off the kitchen faucet. So it's not surprising that Alexa has made the leap from the home to the car. But just as Alexa promises added hands-free convenience for drivers, researchers and engineers warn that it also opens new avenues for hacking, tracking and sonic attacks. Depending on how voice-activated assistants are connected, such hacks could range from annoying pranks like opening a car's windows in the rain to dangerous attacks like remotely unlocking a house's doors for a robbery. ""As we make everything smarter and more connected,"" said Nadir Izrael, chief technology officer of the internet security firm Armis, ""we end up creating a huge attack surface on devices, like cars, that weren't intended."" Last year, Armis discovered one such vulnerability — known as BlueBorne — that exposed billions of connected devices, including Amazon's Echo and Google's Home smart speakers, to the possibility of being hijacked by hackers. Cars with Bluetooth were also vulnerable. Cars are a highly lucrative target, said Yoni Heilbronn, chief marketing officer at Argus Cyber Security, which the automotive systems supplier Continental recently acquired. ""People are inside these vehicles moving at high speeds, and cars cost a significant amount of money. So how many Bitcoins would you pay a ransomware hacker?"" Navigation systems already recognize — often imperfectly — drivers' voices, and many cars have their own speech-recognition features. Connect a smartphone to a car's infotainment system, and a driver can have access to features including Apple's Siri or Google's Assistant. But in those cases, voice commands are limited. They can't remotely start a car or open its windows. Siri can't even change the radio station. Alexa, on the other hand, is intended — via specific, preprogrammed commands — to interact with thousands of connected devices, performing tasks like turning on lights, opening door locks, disabling home security systems or even ordering a year's supply of toilet paper. And it's already connecting living rooms to cars. Automakers ranging from BMW, Ford, Hyundai and Nissan to start-ups like Byton have tapped into Alexa's appeal. Although voice assistants are increasingly becoming intertwined with new models, including those from Mercedes-Benz and Toyota, most current Alexa car skills are strictly one-way, from the home to the car, and use existing automotive smartphone applications. ""Alexa piggybacks on our app,"" said Denise Barfuss, a senior manager for connected services at Nissan. ""So if it's 25 degrees outside, you can just tell Alexa to start the car"" from inside your house to warm it up, she said. Simple Alexa commands can flash the lights or honk the horn, Ms. Barfuss said, but remote instructions that alter the state of the car — such as locking the doors and starting the engine — also require a spoken PIN code. And even though voice bots like Alexa and Google's Assistant can be taught to recognize different voices — well enough to cater to each family member's favored Pandora stations, for example — they do not offer any sort of biometric security, such as voice print analysis. As a result, Alexa's voice-recognition capabilities are not discerning enough for security purposes, according to Amazon. (A company spokesman noted, however, that Amazon had special teams dedicated to continually reviewing and updating the security of its software.) Without such measures, anyone who eavesdropped on a spoken PIN command could use it to unlock and get into a vehicle, leaving a victim to ask, ""Alexa, what happened to my car?"" Security experts are also concerned about more sophisticated cyberattacks involving voice assistants. ""There are synthetic voice sound clips,"" said Gang Wang, assistant professor at Virginia Tech's College of Engineering. ""It sounds like random noise to us, but to the machine it sounds like a specific command."" So a seemingly innocuous sound, like an explosion in a YouTube video played on a nearby TV or tablet, could contain secret instructions. Other hacks have included ultrasonic commands that are beyond the range of human hearing but understood by voice bots. And even if they do establish biometric security features, Mr. Wang said, regenerative machine learning could use a recording of a person's voice to synthesize new commands that could fool them. The safety and security concerns become more challenging when tools like Alexa are used to make car-to-home connections. While cruising down I-95, a driver can open a garage door back at home or shut off the living room lights, for example. Ford already offers such car-to-home capabilities that, using its Ford+Alexa app, can tap into some 25,000 Alexa skills in vehicles that have the company's Sync 3 in-dash system. Ford has also added a new feature that allows the driver to forgo the push-to-talk button and trigger Alexa by uttering a wake-up phrase. Such convenience does allow for the possibility that restive children could prank Alexa from the back seat simply by calling out for, say, Rick Astley songs. Timur Pulathaneli, Ford's supervisor of connected vehicles and services, said that if it proved to be a nuisance, drivers could turn the feature off in the app so that Alexa would respond only after a button was pushed on the steering wheel. Ford's setup also limits what a car thief or a parking attendant can do behind the wheel. A person wouldn't automatically be able to unlock a home's front door from the car because such functions work only in conjunction with the owner's smartphone (which they'd have to steal, too). Adding voice assistants to vehicles may make cars seem like just another device on the so-called Internet of Things, but it raises the stakes significantly. ""What gets added with the car is your specific location,"" Mr. Wang said. ""You can track where the car goes and at what times."" If compromised, Alexa could provide a criminal with details about a user's purchases, driving habits and travel routines. And to make it easier to connect different smart devices, Alexa can scan for compatible gadgets. All that information is sent back to Amazon's servers and then shared with other companies, Travis Witteveen, chief executive of the security firm Avira, pointed out. The sharing of such information increases the system's — and the car's — security vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, the conveniences that digital assistants offer may make them an ineluctable part of the next generation of cars. Nuance, a leading speech-recognition company involved in the automotive business, is already working on voice systems for cars that would be even easier to use. Eric Montague, Nuance's senior director of product marketing and strategy, said the company would introduce a system this year that did not require the driver to use a wake-up word or push a button to talk. Ultimately, the car will simply understand when it's being spoken to. ""People will expect to be able to have a conversation with their car,"" said Martyn Humphries, a vice president at NXP, whose sensors are used extensively in automotive applications. ""So security is going to have to continue to evolve with it."""
0,2018-01-26," When New Jersey announced a $7 billion package of tax incentives to try to lure Amazon's second headquarters to Newark, local officials saw a chance to jump-start a city that has long struggled with poverty and joblessness. Many economists, however, saw something else: a failed development strategy that they had hoped was falling out of favor. In their view, tax incentives are little more than corporate giveaways that divert money from education, infrastructure and other priorities that ultimately do more for a region's economy. In the last decade, those arguments seemed to be gaining traction, as state and local officials put limits on once-generous handouts. But that restraint may be crumbling. Several locations like Chicago and suburban Montgomery County in Maryland have offered Amazon their own nine- and 10-figure incentive packages. The Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn last year persuaded Wisconsin to offer more than $4 billion in tax credits and other inducements to build a new plant. And the next big competition could be taking shape: Apple announced plans last week for a new campus somewhere in the United States, although it said it did not plan an Amazon-style public auction. ""The stakes are getting higher and the deals are getting worse for the taxpayer,"" said Amy Liu, director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution and a longtime critic of tax incentives. More than 200 North American cities submitted bids for Amazon's second headquarters, and the enthusiasm is hardly surprising. The e-commerce giant has said it plans to invest as much as $5 billion in the project and to hire up to 50,000 workers, most earning high salaries. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, said the project could be ""transformational even for a big city."" But the project also carries risks. Accommodating Amazon's thousands of workers will require hiring more teachers, widening roads and building more housing. The costs for those upgrades will fall on residents and existing businesses. Gina Schaefer, who owns a dozen hardware stores in the Washington area, said she did not mind paying taxes, and had learned to deal with the bureaucratic hurdles that come with running a small business in the area. But she said it was frustrating to watch local governments — three of the 20 finalists for the Amazon project are in the Washington area — roll out the red carpet for a multibillion-dollar corporation. Suddenly, she said, her tax dollars could be flowing to one of her most daunting competitors. ""There are no incentives for those of us who are already here,"" Ms. Schaefer said. Alluding to Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, she added, ""Why should the richest man in the history of the world get money to open his business?"" Indeed, tax incentives tend to flow overwhelmingly to big, established companies, rather than to the local start-ups that research has shown are a more significant source of job growth. And some who have studied the issue say incentives rarely work: Companies will play cities and states off one another to save money, but ultimately base site-selection decisions mostly on other factors. Megan Randall, a researcher at the Urban Institute who studies economic development policy, said companies cared most about a talented work force, which requires good schools and colleges, and amenities like affordable housing, parks and public transit that make a place desirable. Tax incentives, she said, make those investments harder for local governments to afford. ""Those dollars are things that could go toward educating kids, building roads, investing in quality of life for your residents,"" Ms. Randall said. Many local officials acknowledge the downsides to incentives, and say they try to build in protections, such as clawback clauses that require companies to repay incentives if they do not hire as many workers as promised. But they say that refusing to offer incentives at all is the equivalent of unilateral disarmament. ""Nobody wants to get involved in it, nobody wants to have to do this, but we're in a competitive environment,"" said Dennis M. Davin, secretary of community and economic development for Pennsylvania, where two cities — Philadelphia and Pittsburgh — are among the 20 finalists for the Amazon project. Still, until recently there had been signs that cities and states were, if not declaring a cease-fire, at least taking steps toward de-escalation in the incentive wars. Counties in Ohio and Colorado reached regional agreements to stop using tax breaks to compete with one another, and Florida's Legislature voted to rein in that state's business incentive program. Several states commissioned audits of their programs and took steps to make them more transparent. And although megadeals never disappeared, the growth of incentives programs did slow for a period. Timothy J. Bartik, an economist at the Upjohn Institute in Kalamazoo, Mich., has compiled a database of state tax incentives dating back to 1990. The value of such incentives soared in the 1990s, Mr. Bartik has found, but has largely leveled off since the early 2000s. ""It really seemed like the incentive competition had kind of stabilized,"" Mr. Bartik said. Economists are not opposed to all incentives in all cases. Publicly funded transportation upgrades or job-training programs, for example, can help entice companies while also benefiting existing businesses. Tax credits aimed at revitalizing abandoned, polluted or blighted areas can encourage development that eventually expands a city's tax base. That is essentially the approach taken by New York, another Amazon finalist. Alicia Glen, the city's deputy mayor for housing and economic development, said Amazon would probably get hardly any tax breaks if it chose to locate its second headquarters in Midtown or Lower Manhattan, the city's two traditional business centers. But the company would get tax breaks if it selected less-established sites in Brooklyn or Queens. Those incentives, she noted, are available to any company that locates in those areas, although New York State could also offer its own tax breaks. ""We don't rely on incentives, but we do have incentives in place to encourage companies to go to parts of the city that they might not otherwise consider,"" Ms. Glen said. Other cities, though, may already be buckling to the competitive pressure. After New Jersey announced its incentive package, Maryland countered with its own $5 billion package. Few packages rival those bids in scale, but other cities have come up with their own creative offerings. Columbus, Ohio, for example, would waive all property taxes for Amazon for 15 years, subject to certain conditions, and would give back a share of the income taxes paid by Amazon's employees to the company in cash. Many cities have kept the details of their bids under wraps, but have left little doubt that they are open to negotiations. ""We're not going to be outbid on Amazon doing business here,"" said Mike Rawlings, the mayor of Dallas. ""We dream no small dreams here. We want to be the biggest and the best."" But even in Texas, there are limits. Nelson W. Wolff, the county executive whose domain includes San Antonio, said he would have loved to see Amazon open its new headquarters there, but he was not interested in breaking the bank to make it happen. In a letter to Mr. Bezos in October, Mr. Wolff and Ron Nirenberg, San Antonio's mayor, said the city would sit out the process and instead invest its resources in education and housing. ""I knew it was going to be a big bloody incentive war,"" Mr. Wolff said, ""and I just didn't think we'd be able to play in that kind of game."""

GINA SCHAEFER, who owns a dozen hardware stores in the Washington area, on tax incentives to entice Jeff Bezos to locate Amazon's second headquarters in suburban Montgomery County, Md."
0,2018-01-28," Hollywood says it's done with Harvey Weinstein, James Toback, Kevin Spacey and other figures ousted for misconduct through the #MeToo movement. But what about Woody Allen? His film distributor, Amazon, the presenters of his musical ""Bullets Over Broadway,"" and colleagues are now grappling with renewed scrutiny of allegations that Mr. Allen molested his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow in 1992 when she was a child. Mr. Allen has steadfastly denied the claims and was not charged. But at a moment when women's voices and stories have been amplified as never before, Ms. Farrow's account carries more force — as even defenders of Mr. Allen are starting to acknowledge. ""I do feel that it's an escalation,"" Letty Aronson, Mr. Allen's sister and longtime producer, said in an interview, calling #MeToo a tool that has been used for ""ulterior motives."" Ms. Farrow told The Times that she was using the movement as it was intended, to shine a light on ""the truth"" about sexual abuse. In conversations with Hollywood executives and insiders, allegiances were split between Mr. Allen, the Oscar-winning icon of 20th-century cinema, and Ms. Farrow, a sympathetic figure who has recently made her case powerfully on social media and  in her first appearance on television. Her allegations are not new, but the response from stars who once worked with Mr. Allen is now different. Mira Sorvino, who won an Oscar for her breakout role in Mr. Allen's ""Mighty Aphrodite,"" publicly apologized to Ms. Farrow, while others, like Colin Firth, have distanced themselves from the director. The shift raises questions about whether Mr. Allen can maintain the clout to attract A-listers to his future films — he is at work on another screenplay — and how much any of his projects can outrun the controversy. Ms. Aronson and others believe that it helped sink Kate Winslet's Oscar chances for Mr. Allen's 2017 film, ""Wonder Wheel."" Onscreen, another casualty could be ""A Rainy Day in New York,"" Mr. Allen's soon-to-be-completed next movie, which was financed and due to be distributed by Amazon. The company has not made any decisions about the film's future, but Amazon is having serious conversations about ending its relationship with Mr. Allen, which could leave the movie without distribution, according to two people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Amazon has contractual obligations to Mr. Allen and the film, one of these people noted. Making the situation more thorny for Amazon: Roy Price, who was ousted as the head of Amazon Studios in October amid sexual harassment allegations, was the one who brought Mr. Allen to the streaming service, spending lavishly to do so. He bankrolled ""Wonder Wheel"" for an astounding $25 million, a huge step up from Mr. Allen's pre-Amazon films. (Released in December, it took in just $1.4 million at the North American box office.) After Ms. Farrow called out actors for supporting #MeToo while also working with Mr. Allen, several stars of ""Rainy Day,"" including Timothée Chalamet and Rebecca Hall, publicly donated their salaries from it to charities and Time's Up, the Hollywood campaign against harassment and assault. Ms. Hall, a star of Mr. Allen's 2008 film ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" worked one day on ""Rainy Day,"" but said in an Instagram post, ""I regret this decision and wouldn't make the same one today."" Cherry Jones, the Tony- and Emmy-winning actress who also appears in ""Rainy Day,"" had a different response when asked how she felt about Mr. Allen and whether she would work with him again. ""There are those who are comfortable in their certainty. I am not. I don't know the truth,"" she told The Times. ""When we condemn by instinct our democracy is on a slippery slope."" An Amazon spokesman declined to comment on ""Rainy Day"" beyond a terse statement: ""We have not announced a release date for this film."" Ms. Aronson said Mr. Allen was still editing the movie and did not expect it to be released before next winter. At any point, the film's marketing may suffer if stars like Mr. Chalamet and Ms. Hall don't promote it — typically a vital part of the publicity for Mr. Allen's actor-driven films. For Amazon, part of the calculation is likely about the bottom line: whether the company would be harmed financially, or reputationally, by continuing to be associated with Mr. Allen. Ms. Aronson argued that Ms. Farrow and her supporters had ""capitalized"" on the #MeToo movement to intensify attention on what the Allen camp views as discredited accusations against him. In a statement, Mr. Allen said that Ms. Farrow was ""cynically"" aligning herself with Time's Up. Ms. Farrow, in an email to The Times, replied: ""If Woody Allen and his surrogates' response to this is that I'm capitalizing on a moment in which it is in vogue to carefully look at the facts, rather than rely on thin defenses from powerful men without question — a moment in which the truth is in fashion — I'd say they're right."" Ms. Farrow's claim was investigated in 1992 and 1993 by authorities in Connecticut, where the alleged assault took place, and in New York. The investigations concluded there was no abuse. A state's attorney in Connecticut said he had probable cause to prosecute Mr. Allen but would not, to spare Ms. Farrow the pain of a court appearance at a young age. The recent fallout tilted against Mr. Allen has extended past Hollywood. On Thursday a Connecticut theater canceled a production of Mr. Allen's ""Bullets Over Broadway,"" based on his 1994 movie, citing ""the current dialogue on sexual harassment and misconduct."" The majority of Mr. Allen's stars have not weighed in. But a handful of performers, without directly addressing guilt or innocence, have expressed regret over working with Mr. Allen, or vowed not to again. Ms. Farrow's statements, in which she detailed her alleged abuse as a 7-year-old, and how she felt let down by the film community, ""made me realize that I increased another woman's pain, and I was heartbroken by that realization,"" said Greta Gerwig, who appeared in Mr. Allen's ""To Rome With Love"" in 2012. A top Hollywood strategist who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect her professional relationships said that she would advise her clients not to work with Mr. Allen. She said a role in an Allen film would be too hard to justify — a career choice over a possible moral stand. Others pointed to the trajectory of artists like Roman Polanski as an example of the entertainment industry's longstanding moral leniency. In the decades since Mr. Polanski fled the United States to avoid sentencing after pleading guilty to unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl, he has enjoyed a flourishing career in Europe, where audiences have been conditioned to separate the art from the artist. He continued casting top Hollywood stars and won an Oscar in 2003 for directing ""The Pianist."" (Mr. Allen has long had devoted fans, and more box office fortune, in Europe. ""Wonder Wheel,"" which has taken in $9 million overseas thus far, is due to open in France this week.) Alec Baldwin, a repeat star of Mr. Allen's films, has come to his defense, writing on Twitter that ""the renunciation of him and his work, no doubt, has some purpose. But it's unfair and sad to me."" He called working with Mr. Allen ""one of the privileges of my career."" Ms. Aronson and other partisans of Mr. Allen's contend that the efforts of the Farrow family to discredit Mr. Allen are burnished by Ronan Farrow's role, through his investigative reports in The New Yorker, in exposing Harvey Weinstein's years of alleged abuse. Mr. Farrow, Dylan's brother, has also publicly supported her. ""Ronan is in a good position now,"" Ms. Aronson said. ""He's traveling around with a halo. Unfortunately, he's wrong"" about Mr. Allen. (Mr. Farrow declined to comment.) Mr. Allen is continuing on the creative path he has followed for decades: always writing — in addition to a screenplay, Ms. Aronson said he may be working on short stories or possibly a book — and playing clarinet at his regular Monday-night gig at the Carlyle on the Upper East Side. ""His life hasn't changed,"" she said. But his artistic vision may be out of step with the times. His last four films have flopped at the North American box office, taking in a cumulative $26.9 million — roughly half of which goes to theater owners — while carrying a collective $85 million in estimated production costs, not including marketing. Poor reviews have played a role. But box office analysts say that women, in particular younger women, have grown increasingly determined to boycott his films since 2013, when Dylan Farrow first spoke in detail about her claims of abuse in an interview with Vanity Fair. Before Amazon's largess, Mr. Allen, like most indie filmmakers, financed his movies by preselling distribution rights. Even as his box office results faltered, he was able to attract continued interest from distributors by casting major stars. And he was able to cast major stars (and often persuade them to work for reduced salaries) because of his reputation as a film legend and because awards sometimes followed. But pull out one element — the stars — and the model could collapse. Despite signs of wavering support in Hollywood, Ms. Aronson was still defiantly confident that Mr. Allen could make any movie he wants. Financing is already in place for the script he's working on now, she said, outside the Amazon deal. And as for casting, actors are a renewable resource. ""I have no doubt,"" she said, ""that he'll be able to find new talent."" Though prolific, at 82, Mr. Allen may be nearing his closing chapter as a filmmaker. Some industry observers suggested that if he continued working quietly, the controversy would blow over, as it has before — because, until #MeToo, Hollywood always had a short memory."
1,2018-01-28," SEATTLE — The other week, 218 cities and states lost in the sweepstakes to be the home of Amazon's second headquarters, failing to make the list of 20 finalists. But Amazon thanks them for playing. That is because the hundreds of applications gave Amazon a hidden benefit: free research that the company can mine when picking spots for future warehouses and satellite offices. Amazon asked every city and state applying for its second headquarters for details about local resources, like available talent and transit options. Local officials were also prodded for tips on local education programs and tax incentives. The answers — most of which have not been released publicly — essentially do Amazon's homework for it, providing valuable information that the company otherwise would have needed to dig up on its own or obtain through one-on-one negotiations. The application from the Kansas City, Mo., region detailed a program for teaching technical skills to preschoolers through 12th graders, according to a person briefed on the submissions, who would speak only anonymously because the discussions were private. A local coalition that helps military veterans make the transition to civilian jobs, which could help Amazon's efforts to recruit veterans, also caught the company's eye. The company did not realize until it saw the application from Louisville, Ky., the person said, that there is a large pool of technical talent within 200 miles of the city and a local public-private partnership that helps train students to become entry-level software developers. The Montreal submission stood out, the person said, with its thinking about attracting foreign talent to the region. Amazon alluded to the upside of the information last week when Holly Sullivan, its head of economic development, said the rejected locations could receive a consolation prize of sorts. ""Through this process we learned about many new communities across North America that we will consider as locations for future infrastructure investment and job creation,"" she said in a statement. Amazon's plans are another illustration of how its search contest is about more than a second headquarters, or HQ2, as the company calls it. The winning location, Amazon says, will get up to 50,000 high-paying jobs and billions of dollars in construction. Those promises have generated extraordinary genuflection from politicians across North America, and a lot of glowing news coverage, at a moment of heightened scrutiny about Amazon's market power. By getting 238 communities to give their best pitch, Amazon has also gotten insight into the kinds of accommodations that places are willing to make to bring it to town. ""This is not just about HQ2,"" said Richard Florida, an authority on urban development and a professor at the University of Toronto. ""It's about a broader locational strategy. HQ2 is the carrot. That's the only thing that makes sense."" The proposal from Detroit, which did not make the final 20, offers another peek into the sort of incentives that Amazon has received from the HQ2 bids, and how the inducements could factor into Amazon's planning for other projects. The city offered to let Amazon operate for 30 years without paying real estate and personal property taxes and a variety of other local taxes, according to a report in Crain's Detroit Business. Ari B. Adler, a spokesman for Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan, confirmed the report's accuracy. Mr. Adler said Amazon's bidding process would make Detroit a stronger contender for any company looking for a new or expanded location. Amazon already has other facilities in the state, and Michigan welcomes more of them, he said. ""We heard from Amazon that some of the key things in our favor during the review process were our commitment to partnerships, the creativity of our proposal and the investments being made in the region's growth,"" Mr. Adler said. Only about 40,000 of Amazon's 540,000 global employees work in Seattle, its home base. Its work force is largely spread across warehouses and other parts of the logistics network that deliver the billions of items Amazon ships every year. There are more than 300 warehouses and other shipping centers in the United States alone, according to estimates by MWPVL International, a supply chain and logistics consulting firm. The company is adding new ones at a fast clip. Amazon warehouses are often close to metropolitan areas so orders can be delivered to population centers as quickly as possible. A company site selection team scouts potential locations. The company also has more than a dozen satellite offices focused on research and development — Amazon calls them ""tech hubs."" It has a large robotics unit near Boston, a machine translation team in Pittsburgh and a video game development group in San Diego. State and local officials have been enthusiastic about the jobs at the warehouses, offering tax breaks and raving about Amazon's arrival in news releases. Since 2000, Amazon has received over $1.1 billion in public subsidies for its facilities and other operations, according to estimates by Good Jobs First, a nonpartisan research group that tracks economic development. Mark Williams, president of the Strategic Development Group, a site selection consulting firm, said available tax breaks, like those offered by Detroit, could be one of the most important pieces of information for Amazon. ""There are discretionary incentives that aren't on the books that come in the heat of a deal,"" Mr. Williams said. ""In most cases, those are the most valuable incentives."" But he said the bids could also show a community's willingness to offer other benefits. ""There are special grant funds, special bond funds, naming of roads,"" he said. ""It's not like you can acquire these through a data search."" Mr. Florida, the urban studies professor, advised Kansas City (an also-ran) and Toronto (a finalist) on their bids. He believes Amazon also ""has something in mind"" for the 20 places still in the game — including Indianapolis, Miami and Columbus, Ohio. The company is talking to all 20 and getting even more information from them. ""What is a better distribution hub than Columbus or Indianapolis?"" Mr. Florida said. ""What is a better Latin America headquarters than Miami?"" One of the finalists, Denver, whose bid has been made public, provided Amazon with elaborate breakdowns of the number of students who graduated from Colorado from 2014 to 2016 with degrees in computer engineering, computer graphics, information technology, tax law and human resources management. The city boasted about the large number of faculty at the University of Colorado, in nearby Boulder, focused on computer science. Denver also suggested a handful of possible development sites for Amazon, though those locations were redacted from the public material. ""There is no better place for Amazon's second home than Colorado,"" John W. Hickenlooper, the state's governor, said in a cover letter with its application addressed to Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive."
0,2018-01-29," Q. On my Amazon Echo at home, I can ask ""What's new?"" and get a briefing from sources I've selected for news, business, sports and so on. Is there anything similar to that for an iPhone so I can get this type of information read to me while I'm in the car? A. Along the lines of Amazon's Alexa flash briefing feature, Apple's Siri virtual assistant has a new skill to help users keep up with current events. (Apple's own Echo competitor, the HomePod speaker, arrives next month.) In response to the command, ""Hey, Siri, give me the news,"" the software plays the latest newscast from National Public Radio. If you prefer another news source you can tell Siri to switch to Fox News, CNN or an audio update from The Washington Post. If you have news shows in your iPhone's Podcasts app, you can also order the software to start playing a show by name, as in ""Hey, Siri, play 'The Daily.'"" If the program does not respond to the sound of your voice saying ""Hey, Siri,"" check your settings to make sure the hands-free control is enabled. Tap the Settings icon on the home screen, select Siri & Search and turn on the button next to the ""Listen for 'Hey Siri'"" option. The iPhone 6s or later (or at least an iPad Pro) does not need to be connected to power to use the ""Hey, Siri"" command, but older models must be plugged in to a charger or USB jack. Alternative ways of summoning Siri include pressing the Home or side buttons, depending on your model — but are not the safest way of interacting with the phone while driving. The Google Assistant app for Android and iOS can also handle the request when you say something like, ""O.K. Google, I want to listen to the news."" Other third-party apps that stream news shows are available in the App Store."
0,2018-01-30," Good Tuesday. Here's what we're watching: • Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase are teaming up to form a health care company. • Ken Chenault is moving to venture capital. • JPMorgan has (and hasn't) clarified its succession plans. • What should we expect in tonight's State of the Union speech? Want this in your own email inbox? Here's the sign-up. Health care stocks fell on news that Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan are partnering to form a venture to lower the health care costs of their employees. The e-commerce giant has so disrupted businesses from booksellers to grocers to department stores over its two decades as a public company that just the mere mention of it entering a new sector spooks investors. And with good reason. Amazon could spend huge sums, and bear years of losses, to win customers with lower prices. But beyond that threat, there are some big questions looming over the initiative. 1) What is it? The venture will be an independent company that ""is free from profit-making incentives and constraints."" That sounds liberating, and there is no reason to think it won't be, but such visionary language would pack a bigger punch if it was accompanied by hard cash. The release did not give details about the initial investment in the venture. 2) How big will it really be? The effort focuses on the United States employees of JPMorgan Chase, Amazon and Berkshire Hathaway. Together, the companies have nearly one million employees (a portion of those, though, are outside of the United States.) That's a lot of employees but relatively small when compared with 157 million people who had employer health care plans at the end of 2016, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Would the venture be able to scale up? Some experts are skeptical about that. Ben Gomes-Casseres, a professor of international business at Brandeis, wrote: ""My bet is that JPMorgan and Amazon's employees have pretty good health coverage, with plans that rank among the richest that the industry has to offer. If so, will these lead users be anxious to find a more cost-effective model? Will they even be willing to experiment with their coverage? And, beyond that – if they do develop a new approach, will it be helpful to the masses of employees at lesser companies, or, worse, the unemployed and uninsured?"" 3) Do these companies bring valuable expertise to providing health care at a lower cost? It's not clear how much more expertise Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan have than companies that have been operating in health care for decades. Amazon could have gotten into pharmacy services years ago, if it had wanted, which means it might have seen complexities and risks that don't exist in other sectors. Berkshire brings a strong insurance specialization, but not in providing health insurance directly to the consumer. What is more, Berkshire's point man in the joint health care effort will be Todd Combs, an investor who does not come from the insurance operations of the company. 4) If the high cost of health care is the main problem, what can this venture do to cut costs? Much depends on whether the effort can address the main reason that health care spending has gone up in the United States versus other countries. A recent Upshot column showed how much of the rise is a result of more being done for patients during hospital stays and doctor visits, or that they are charged more for those services. One way to assess the brash new initiative from Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon is whether it does anything to address this dynamic. — Peter Eavis That's how Warren Buffett referred to the nation's ""ballooning costs of health care"" Tuesday. Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway announced it is teaming up with JPMorgan Chase and Amazon to form an independent health care company to serve their employees in the United States. The three companies provided few details about the new entity, other than saying it would initially focus on technology to provide simplified, high-quality health care for their employees and their families, and at a reasonable cost. They said the initiative, which is in the early planning stages, would be a long-term effort ""free from profit-making incentives and constraints."" Mr. Buffett's concern about rising health care costs is not new, nor is his use of ""tapeworm"" to describe them. Mr. Buffett's statement Tuesday echoes other recent comments he has made on the subject. He trotted out the tapeworm metaphor to describe rising medical costs during television interviews in 2010 and 2012, MoneyBeat's Ben Eisen and Erik Holm point out. At Berkshire's annual meeting in May, he said: ""Medical costs are the tapeworm of American economic competitiveness."" In fact, Mr. Buffett use of the tapeworm metaphor to describe drags on the economy dates back more than three-and-a-half decades at least. Mr. Buffett wrote in his 1981 shareholder letter: ""Inflation acts as a gigantic corporate tapeworm."" Then in his 2013 letter to Berkshire shareholders, he wrote: ""Citizens and public officials typically under-appreciated the gigantic financial tapeworm that was born when promises were made that conflicted with a willingness to fund them."" The smooth glide higher for U.S. stock markets may be hitting a bumpier stretch. Volatility, as measured by the widely followed C.B.O.E. Volatility Index, or VIX, jumped nearly 30 percent in recent days as investors paused to consider the ongoing sell-off in the United States dollar and rising yields on United States government debt. The S.&P. 500 stock index dropped roughly 0.7 percent early Tuesday and could notch its second consecutive decline, something that hasn't happened since mid-December. Low interest rates have been a key ingredient in the almost relentless rise in U.S. equity markets. But with the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury now above 2.70 percent, its highest level in four years, that backdrop could be changing. — Matt Phillips Despite being inundated by post-American Express job offers, Ken Chenault has chosen an interesting path: becoming chairman and managing partner of General Catalyst Partners, which has invested in Airbnb, Warby Parker and Stripe, among others. More interesting is why he's taking the job, Andrew writes in his latest DealBook column. He's hoping to be the adult in the room for the next generation of start-ups, after the troubles at Uber, SoFi and more. Here's what he told Andrew: In selecting Rob Shafir — previously the head of Credit Suisse's American operations — as the successor to Daniel Och, the hedge fund has apparently laid to rest questions about its leadership planning. A reminder: Before Mr. Shafir, Mr. Och's chosen successor was James Levin. Then the two men had a falling out. Mr. Och's statement: And a statement by Mr. Levin, who had weighed quitting — but was identified in today's statement as still being Och-Ziff's co-chief investment officer: — Michael J. de la Merced The JPMorgan Chase chief said yesterday that he plans to stick around another five years. So who will eventually pick up the baton? In the short term: It could be Daniel Pinto, the head of JPMorgan's investment bank, or Gordon Smith, the head of its consumer bank. They were named co-presidents yesterday — but Mr. Pinto is 55 and Mr. Smith is 59. In the longer term: It could be one of the other executives named in the firm's statement: • Mary Erdoes, 50, who runs the asset and wealth management arm • Doug Petno, 52, who runs the commercial banking division • Marianne Lake, 48, the C.F.O. ""The board and Dimon both believe that under all timing scenarios, whether today or in the future, the company has several highly capable successors in place,"" JPMorgan said in its statement. But the firm has had trouble holding onto potential successors over the years. The political question: Mr. Dimon has said publicly that he isn't going to run for president. (There's been speculation, and friends are still encouraging him to try.) Critics' corner • Antony Currie writes, ""JPMorgan has given Jamie Dimon the freedom to outstay his welcome."" (Breakingviews) • Lex writes, ""As murky as the future is, the situation at JPMorgan is probably preferable to Goldman, where there is a ferocious thinly-disguised competition between the two co-presidents for the top job."" (FT) Surely jobs and the economy, given how often he has spoken on those topics (including at the World Economic Forum in Davos). Politico also suggests infrastructure, immigration, trade and national security. But here are the big questions: • Will President Trump stick to the script and focus on issues like spending $1 trillion on infrastructure? • How hard will he press the White House immigration proposal? Democrats are opposed, and the next shutdown deadline is Feb. 8. • Will he touch on health care, given that Republicans have so far rolled back only a small portion of the Affordable Care Act? • Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee voted to release a contentious memo alleging improprieties in the surveillance of a Trump campaign associate.

But Mr. Weiss left Lazard to become a counselor at the Treasury Department under the Obama administration, taking on issues like Puerto Rico's debt crisis and new lending marketplaces. Since then He's become a senior fellow at the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at Harvard's Kennedy School, and a director at the Volcker Alliance. He has considered getting back into investment banking, and has been courted by many a bank. And he might yet start his own shop. Companies want to go public.

1,2018-01-30," SEATTLE — Three corporate behemoths — Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase — announced on Tuesday that they would form an independent health care company for their employees in the United States. The alliance was a sign of just how frustrated American businesses are with the state of the nation's health care system and the rapidly spiraling cost of medical treatment. It also caused further turmoil in an industry reeling from attempts by new players to attack a notoriously inefficient, intractable web of doctors, hospitals, insurers and pharmaceutical companies. It was unclear how extensively the three partners would overhaul their employees' existing health coverage — whether they would simply help workers find a local doctor, steer employees to online medical advice or use their muscle to negotiate lower prices for drugs and procedures. While the alliance will apply only to their employees, these corporations are so closely watched that whatever successes they have could become models for other businesses. Major employers, from Walmart to Caterpillar, have tried for years to tackle the high costs and complexity of health care, and have grown increasingly frustrated as Congress has deadlocked over the issue, leaving many of the thorniest issues to private industry. About 151 million Americans get their health insurance from an employer. (Why will health care be so difficult for these companies to untangle? Analysis from The Upshot.) But Tuesday's announcement landed like a thunderclap — sending stocks for insurers and other major health companies tumbling. Shares of health care companies like UnitedHealth Group and Anthem plunged on Tuesday, dragging down the broader stock market. That weakness reflects the strength of the new entrants. The partnership brings together Amazon, the online retail giant known for disrupting major industries; Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company led by the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett; and JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the United States by assets. They are moving into an industry where the lines between traditionally distinct areas, such as pharmacies, insurers and providers, are increasingly blurry. CVS Health's deal last month to buy the health insurer Aetna for about $69 billion is just one example of the changes underway. Separately, Amazon's potential entry into the pharmacy business continues to rattle major drug companies and distributors. (Here's a look at how even the threat of Amazon's entry into an industry can rattle stocks.) The companies said the initiative, which is in its early stages, would be ""free from profit-making incentives and constraints,"" but did not specify whether that meant they would create a nonprofit organization. The tax implications were also unclear because so few details were released. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said in a statement that the effort could eventually be expanded to benefit all Americans. ""The health care system is complex, and we enter into this challenge open-eyed about the degree of difficulty,"" Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and chief executive, said in a statement. ""Hard as it might be, reducing health care's burden on the economy while improving outcomes for employees and their families would be worth the effort."" The announcement touched off a wave of speculation about what the new company might do, especially given Amazon's extensive reach into the daily lives of Americans — from where they buy their paper towels to what they watch on television. It follows speculation that the company, which recently purchased the grocery chain Whole Foods, might use its stores as locations for pharmacies or clinics. (We asked health care experts to imagine what the three corporations might do.) ""It could be big,"" Ed Kaplan, who negotiates health coverage on behalf of large employers as the national health practice leader for the Segal Group, said of the announcement. ""Those are three big players, and I think if they get into health care insurance or the health care coverage space, they are going to make a big impact."" But others were less sure, noting that the three companies — which, combined, employ more than one million people — might still hold little sway over the largest insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, who oversee the benefits of tens of millions of Americans. ""This is not news in terms of jumbo employers being frustrated with what they can get through the traditional system,"" said Sam Glick of the management consulting firm Oliver Wyman in San Francisco. He played down the notion that the three partners would have more success getting lower prices from hospitals and doctors. ""The idea that they could have any sort of negotiation leverage with unit cost is a pretty far stretch."" Even the three companies don't seem to be sure of how to shake up health care. People briefed on the plan, who asked for anonymity because the discussions were private, said the executives decided to announce the initiative while still a concept in part so they can begin hiring staff for the new company. Three people familiar with the partnership said it took shape as Mr. Bezos, Mr. Buffett, and Mr. Dimon, who are friends, discussed the challenges of providing insurance to their employees. They decided their combined access to data about how consumers make choices, along with an understanding of the intricacies of health insurance, would inevitably lead to some kind of new efficiency — whatever it might turn out to be. ""The ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,"" Mr. Buffett said in the statement. ""Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable."" Over the past several months, the three had met formally — along with Todd Combs, an investment officer at Berkshire Hathaway who is also on JPMorgan's board — to discuss the idea, according to a person familiar with Mr. Buffett's thinking. The three chief executives saw one another at the Alfalfa Club dinner in Washington on Saturday, but by then each had already had dozens of conversations with the small in-house teams they had assembled. The plan was set. Mr. Buffett's motivation stems in part from conversations he has had with two people close to him who have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, according to the person. Mr. Buffett, the person said, believes the condition of the country's health care system is a root cause of economic inequality, with wealthier people enjoying better, longer lives because they can afford good coverage As Mr. Buffett himself has aged — he is 87 — the contrast between his moneyed friends and others has grown starker, the person said. The companies said they would initially focus on using technology to simplify care, but did not elaborate on how they intended to do that or bring down costs. One of the people briefed on the alliance said the new company wouldn't replace existing health insurers or hospitals. Planning for the new company is being led by Marvelle Sullivan Berchtold, a JPMorgan managing director who was previously head of the Swiss drugmaker Novartis's mergers and acquisitions strategy; Mr. Combs; and Beth Galetti, a senior vice president at Amazon. One potential avenue for the partnership might be an online health care dashboard that connects employees with the closest and best doctor specializing in whatever ailment they select from a drop-down menu. Perhaps the companies would strike deals to offer employee discounts with service providers like medical testing facilities. ""Each of those companies has extensive experience using transformative technology in their own businesses,"" said John Sculley, the former chief executive of Apple who is now chairman of a health care start-up, RxAdvance. ""I think it's a great counterweight to what government leadership hasn't done, which is to focus on how do we make this health care system sustainable."" Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, predicted that the companies would attempt to modernize the cumbersome process of doctor appointments by making it more like booking a restaurant reservation on OpenTable, while eliminating the need to regularly fill out paper forms on clipboards. ""I think they will bring the customer-facing, patient-facing thing into your smartphone,"" he said. Amazon has long been mentioned by health care analysts and industry executives as a potential new player in the sector. While the company has remained quiet about its plans, some analysts noted that companies often use their own employees as a testing ground for future initiatives. The entry of Amazon and its partners adds to the upheaval in an industry where much is changing, from government programs after the overhaul of the tax law to the uncertain future of the Affordable Care Act. All the while, medical costs have persistently been on the rise. Nationwide, average premiums for family coverage for employees rose to $18,764 last year, an increase of 19 percent since 2012, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Workers are increasingly paying a greater share of those costs — they now pay 30 percent of the premium, in addition to high deductibles and growing co-payments. ""Our members' balance sheets speak for themselves — health care is a growing cost at a time when other costs are either not rising or falling,"" said Robert Andrews, chief executive of the Healthcare Transformation Alliance, a group of 46 companies, including Coca-Cola and American Express, that have banded together to lower health care costs. Other major employers have also sought more direct control over their employees' health care. Walmart contracted with groups like the Cleveland Clinic, Mayo and Geisinger, among others, to take care of employees who need organ transplants and heart and spine care. Caterpillar, the construction equipment manufacturer, sets its own rules for drug coverage, which it has said saves it millions of dollars per year, even though it still uses a pharmacy benefit manager to process its claims. Suzanne Delbanco, the executive director for the Catalyst for Payment Reform, a nonprofit group that mainly represents employers, said controlling rising prices is especially hard in markets where a local hospital or medical group dominates. While some have tried to tackle the issue in different ways, like sending employees with heart conditions to a specific group, ""it's piecemeal,"" she said. She added, ""There are so many opportunities to do this better."" The issue is not solely a 21st-century concern: In 1915, Henry Ford became increasingly worried about the quality of health care available to his growing work force in Detroit, so he opened the  Henry Ford Hospital. It is still in existence today."
2,2018-01-30," The fledgling plan from Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase to create an independent health care system for their American employees is just as bare-bones as it is bold. The companies, all titans in their respective industries, gave few details Tuesday when they announced the joint effort. The group said its strategy will focus first on technology as a way to provide simplified, affordable access to medical services. Beyond that, here are some ideas from health care and medical experts about how the world's largest online retailer, the largest bank in the United States by assets and the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett's holding company might reshape an industry. _______ ""Amazon could assume drug distribution. They could start to use voice platforms, like Alexa, to help discuss symptoms and get feedback, to coordinate hospital post-op care through voice-activated A.I., to do these and other rote things."" — Dr. Eric Topol, director, Scripps Translational Science Institute in San Diego _______ ""Maybe they will develop some kind of algorithm that can be loaded onto any company software to help employers identify the low-hanging fruit, the patients that are using the most care or the highest-cost drugs. These guys have the data resources to really mine what's going on, to get in the middle of that patient-doctor relationship. But employees are going to have to sign off on letting their employers really dig into that data."" — Erin Fox, senior director of drug information, University of Utah Health Hospitals and Clinics _______ ""The companies have a wealthier work force, which tends to have a higher demand for broad networks. And these people are financially very sophisticated in how they do things, so they may be willing to have more complicated benefit design, and more willing to use I.T. tools to shop for care. I hope they work on building value-based insurance design plans, aligning incentives with the value of care."" — Michael E. Chernew, director, HealthCare Markets and Regulation Lab at Harvard Medical School _______ ""Most health care is local, even though people occasionally seek care away from home. So the opportunity is in leveraging telecommunications technology, in taking advantage of internet-based services that can be delivered to you everywhere, which is a movement already growing rapidly throughout health care."" — David Lansky, chief executive, Pacific Business Group on Health _______ ""With the technology that's available today, it seems like a logical next step for self-insured companies to administer the health benefit themselves. You could develop a relationship where you're significantly reducing costs, while still making the providers whole and cutting out so much of the red tape and bureaucracy that currently stymies and frustrates them. The providers' masters are largely those intermediaries — the health plans, the pharmacy benefit managers. This is a way for companies like Amazon to be the new masters."" — B. Douglas Hoey, chief executive, National Community Pharmacists Association _______ ""You can imagine them using a different sort of model, where everyone gets a concierge to help them with their health care, to have a primary care doctor be an independent advocate that helps patients navigate the system, not as an agent of the hospital where they have to feed the beast. And then if you need lab tests, an M.R.I., an elective service in the hospital, you would have a health savings account and a marketplace with transparent pricing. And then, if something really bad happens — you get leukemia, you get hit by a bus — the high-deductible insurance kicks in. That's the way the market is moving anyway, so I bet this is where these companies are likely going."" — Dr. Rushika Fernandopulle, chief executive, Iora Health, Boston"

4,2018-01-31," BEIJING — Amazon and two other American titans are trying to shake up health care by experimenting with their own employees' coverage. By Chinese standards, they're behind the curve. Technology companies like Alibaba and Tencent have made health care a priority for years, and are using China as their laboratory. After testing online medical advice and drug tracking systems, they are now focused on a more advanced tool: artificial intelligence. Their aggressive push underscores the differences between the health care systems in China and the United States. Chinese hospitals are overburdened, with just 1.5 doctors for every 1,000 people — barely half the figure in the United States. Along with a rapidly aging population, China also has the largest number of obese children in the world, as well as more diabetes patients than anywhere else. The companies' technological push is encouraged by the government. Beijing has said it wants to be a leader in A.I. by 2030 and pledged to take on the United States in the field. While officials have emphasized the use of artificial intelligence in areas like defense and self-driving cars, they have also aggressively promoted its use in health care. Alibaba and Tencent, which already dominate China's e-commerce and mobile payments sectors, are at the forefront. Among their goals: building diagnostic tools that will make doctors more efficient. Amazon and its partners, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway, see technology as a way to provide simplified, affordable medical services. Although the alliance is still in the early stages, it could create online services for medical advice or use its overall heft to negotiate for lower drug prices. ""It's fair to say that across the board, the Chinese tech companies have all embraced being involved in and being active in the health care space, unlike the U.S., where some of them have and some have not,"" said Laura Nelson Carney, an Asia-Pacific health care analyst at Bernstein Research. ""Few of them have made moves as big as in China,"" Ms. Carney said, referring to Alibaba and Tencent's American rivals. Those big moves have had varying degrees of success. In 2014, Alibaba announced a ""future hospital"" plan intended to make treatment more efficient by allowing patients to consult with doctors online and order drugs via the internet. But two years later, Chinese regulators stopped the sale of over-the-counter drugs on Tmall, Alibaba's e-commerce website. They also suspended a drug-monitoring system that the company had created. And last year, the search engine company Baidu scrapped its internet health care service, which allowed patients to book doctors appointments through an app, in a bid to focus solely on A.I. But some of the more recent initiatives have made inroads. Last year, Alibaba's health unit introduced A.I. software that can help interpret CT scans and an A.I. medical lab to help doctors make diagnoses. About a month later, Tencent unveiled Miying, a medical imaging program that helps doctors detect early signs of cancer, in the southwestern region of Guangxi. It is now used in nearly 100 hospitals across China. Tencent has also invested in WeDoctor Group, which has opened its own take on Alibaba's ""future hospital"" in northwestern China. The service allows patients to video chat with doctors and fill their prescriptions online. Advances in artificial intelligence have already been transformative for China's overworked doctors. Dr. Yu Weihong, an ophthalmologist at Peking Union Medical College Hospital, said she used to take up to two days to analyze a patient's eyes by scrutinizing grainy images before discussing her findings with colleagues and writing up a report. Artificial intelligence software currently being tested by the hospital helps her do all that dramatically faster. ""Now, you don't even need a minute,"" she said. The software has been developed by VoxelCloud, a start-up has raised about $28.5 million from companies including Tencent and the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Sequoia Capital. It specializes in automated medical image analysis, helping eye doctors like Dr. Yu screen patients for diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness among China's working-age population. There are just 20 eye doctors for every million people here, a third of the proportion in the United States. In April, Beijing announced an ambitious plan for the country's 110 million diabetics to undergo eye tests. ""It's impossible for one person to read that many images,"" said Dr. Yu. Ding Xiaowei, whose grandparents were doctors, founded VoxelCloud in 2016, three months after completing his doctorate in computer science at U.C.L.A. The company, which has offices in Los Angeles and the Chinese cities of Shanghai and Suzhou, is awaiting the green light from China's version of the F.D.A. for five diagnostic tools for CT scans and retina disease. The sheer size of China's population — nearly 1.4 billion people who could provide a vast number of images to feed into their systems — provides a potential advantage for the development of artificial intelligence. Also helping: China has fewer concerns about privacy, allowing for easier collection of data that could result in smarter and more efficient A.I. systems. Regulation here isn't as strict as in the United States, either. In all, more than 130 companies are applying A.I. in ways that could increase the efficiency of China's health care system, according to Yiou Intelligence, an industry consultancy based in Beijing. They range from behemoths like Alibaba and Tencent to domestic champions iFlyTek, which invented a robot that passed a Chinese medical licensing exam, and an array of smaller start-ups. Money is flowing in. As of last August, venture capitalists such as Sequoia and Matrix Partners had invested at least $2.7 billion in such businesses, according to Yiou. Analysts at Bernstein estimated that spending in China's health tech industry will reach $150 billion by 2020. Behind this push is a realization that the country's health care system is in crisis. With no functioning primary care system, patients flock to hospitals in major cities, sometimes camping out overnight just to get treatment for a fever. Doctors are overworked, and reports of stabbings and assaults by frustrated patients and their relatives are not uncommon. Yunfeng, the personal investment fund of the Alibaba founder Jack Ma, has invested in one company, Yitu, that hopes to address the shortfall of resources. Yitu is working with Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, the best medical facility in eastern Zhejiang province, to develop software that automates the identification of early stages of lung cancer. While it initially focused on facial recognition, Yitu has branched out into more complex image-recognition challenges, like cancer scans. Lin Chenxi, who left Alibaba to establish the company in 2012, said he hoped to use the technology to ensure equal access to medical treatment across China. ""In China, medical resources are very scarce and unequally distributed so that the top resources are concentrated in provincial capitals,"" he said. ""With this system, if it can be used at hospitals in rural cities, then it will make the medical experience much better."" Trying to identify cancer nodes — shifting black-and-white splotches that look something like a Rorschach test — is grueling work, and China's doctors have far less time and resources than their counterparts in the United States and elsewhere. Gong Xiangyang, the head of the hospital's radiology department, likened the process to a factory, where burnout and mistakes from overwork can happen. ""We have to deal with a vast amount of medical images everyday,"" he said. ""So we welcome technology if it can relieve the pressure while boosting efficiency and accuracy."""
5,2018-01-31," The announcement on Tuesday that Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway would be joining forces to create a health care company moved stock markets and prompted optimistic predictions of major reform in a notoriously complex industry. But while the three companies bring successful management, technological expertise and substantial capital to the venture, many health industry experts expressed doubts about whether their results would match their ambition. Here are a few reasons that experts suggest we temper expectations. Over the years, faced with rising costs, employers have banded together to try novel approaches to health insurance benefits. Some have pioneered strategies like working directly with health systems or have achieved significant savings compared with competitors. But none have made a major dent in overall health care spending. ""They contribute in the small wins,"" said Jonathan Kolstad, an associate professor of business at the University of California, Berkeley. ""But those tend to be swamped by growth in health care, which is so high. They're not silver bullets."" Health care is very local, and companies have traditionally had a hard time preventing hospitals and doctors from raising prices or delivering mediocre care, because they don't have enough leverage to force health care providers to do things differently. ""The part that is the most difficult is trying to influence the underlying system,"" said Michael Thompson, the chief executive of the National Alliance of Healthcare Purchaser Coalitions, which represents employer groups. ""Any single company, even broad coalitions, have a hard time."" Technology giants have attempted health care innovation before. Google and Microsoft started health ventures in recent years to a lot of fanfare, with little success. The three companies don't have much direct experience in providing health insurance or services. Chase has invested in the industry, and Berkshire Hathaway has owned insurance companies, but none have worked extensively in health benefits or in managing doctors, hospitals or pharmaceutical companies. ""Just because you know an industry is underperforming and you have a lot of money doesn't mean you have a successful strategy,"" said Leemore Dafny, a professor at Harvard Business School, in an email. Ms. Dafny said she was excited to see such serious players take on this problem, but noted there were numerous examples of outsiders trying, and failing, to succeed in the health care system. Health care is a business that requires a lot of regulatory compliance and negotiation with established players. A new entrant could bring innovative approaches to old problems, but it may also become stymied by the industry's complexity. The entrepreneurs who launched Oscar Health, one of the insurance start-ups to sell policies under the Affordable Care Act, wanted to create something radically different from the competition. But it has had a difficult time living up its initial hopes and has lost substantial sums in what has proved to be a very challenging business. Most disruptive companies enter a market with a product that is lower in value than that of market incumbents, but much lower in cost. That's the model for classic disrupters, like Southwest Airlines, MP3s or Japanese carmakers. Health care tends to be different, because consumers don't usually want to settle for a lower-quality product, even if it is substantially cheaper. Amitabh Chandra, a health economist at Harvard, said that perhaps the easiest way to squeeze a lot of dollars out of the health care system would be to reduce what he called ""low-value services"" — health care treatments that are expensive, but only slightly more effective than cheaper options. But reducing their use is hard because many people still want the better therapy, even if it's not a particularly good value. Highly compensated employees, like those at Chase or at Amazon headquarters, may be particularly attracted to cutting-edge cancer treatments or the latest prescription drugs, he noted. A health plan that cut out such services might hurt the ability to recruit and retain workers needed to succeed in other parts of the business. ""If there was pure inefficiency, I think it would be a lot easier to make progress,"" he said. ""The problem is that all of this stuff has some small benefit."" There are some ways that a smart company might seek to wring real inefficiencies out of health care. It could, say, lower the prices paid to monopoly hospitals, eliminate services that have no value or tighten the supply chain for drugs. Optimists about the venture say, if the company succeeds, it will most likely do so by finding strategies that improve care and reduce cost. The three companies are each large but also very different, and they may have different priorities about how to structure their health benefits. JPMorgan Chase is a financial services company, based in New York, with highly compensated employees. Berkshire Hathaway is a consortium of companies, spread throughout the country, in a variety of industries. And Amazon is a technology company with a hub of highly paid workers in Seattle, and with lower-wage workers spread in warehouses around the country. Will they all want or need the same sort of health plan? In general, companies with a lot of highly paid workers tend to offer generous benefits. Health insurance is not taxed in the same way as other forms of compensation, so an investment banker may prefer a health plan that covers everything instead of one with a big deductible that she has to pay out of her post-tax salary. A lower-wage worker in an Amazon warehouse, by contrast, may want a skimpier health plan and more wages. Big stock market moves after the announcement suggest that investors think that whatever the companies develop could become broadly adopted, undermining the business of existing health care players, and transforming health insurance across the country. This is consistent with some of Amazon's previous strategies, like expansion of its web services business, which was begun as an internal product, and has become dominant in the industry. But savings on health care would accrue directly to the companies' bottom lines, allowing them to hire more workers or increase their profits relative to their competitors. That means selling such services to their competitors would need to be profitable enough to make up for giving competitors that business edge. ""It's not going to transform the economy unless they then share all of those ideas and best practices with their competitors,"" said Craig Garthwaite, a health economist who teaches corporate strategy at the Kellogg School at Northwestern. ""That would not be good for long-term shareholder value for their firms."""
0,2018-02-01," Here's the good news about the announcement this week that Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase are forming a new company to cover health care for their employees: If you're one of the million-plus people who work at these companies, or a family member of one, you're likely to get cheaper, better health care pretty soon. Here's the bad news: If you're one of the approximately 300 million other Americans, you might not see savings for a long time, if ever. And in the short term at least, you could be hit by bigger medical bills. Together, these three behemoth corporations will be able to wrest great deals and discounts in their negotiations from hospital systems, drug manufacturers, medical device makers and doctors' groups. These are likely to be better deals than what lesser companies can wrangle. The health care industry has become a land of giants. Health care systems are gobbling up smaller hospitals at a record pace, and now many places have a monopoly provider. In the device industry, there have been two major mergers and acquisitions in the past seven years, leaving only four companies that supply virtually all of America's hip and knee replacements. There are also just a handful of health insurers in the United States, compared with more than 100 in Germany. Now, with Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos and Jamie Dimon forming a new health care company, employers will have an intimidating proxy warrior in their battles over the $3 trillion United States health care market. Medicare, by law, is not allowed to negotiate discounts on drug prices. But you can bet Amazon-JPMorgan-Berkshire will. Millions of American companies do not have the power, knowledge or data to drive down prices charged by labs or hospitals. But this new company most likely will. Recent history shows that when the medical system loses income from one sector (in this case, three huge corporations), it is adept at making up for it in another. As the Goliaths wrestle over how much they should pay or be paid, the Davids — small companies, individuals who purchase their own insurance and the uninsured — are often left footing the bill. Those bills can be astronomical, like $5,000 for an M.R.I. scan or $100,000 for knee replacement surgery. Hospital systems argue that they have to charge such prices because government insurers — Medicare and Medicaid — don't pay enough to cover their costs. Medicare disputes that. And ""covering their costs"" is a fungible calculation that can include multimillion-dollar executive salaries. Commercial insurers negotiate down from those high prices. But while good negotiators can get great deals, others will miss out. And the uninsured often get bills — and collection notices — asking them to pay the highest prices of all. Some big companies have made efforts to curb prices, with some effect. The supermarket chain Safeway has deployed a technique called ""reference pricing,"" in which it calculates a price sufficient to pay for a high-quality lab test and radiology test. Employees must select a provider that comes in under that bar or pay the difference. Providers have an incentive to drop prices for this big pool of employees. With reference pricing, Safeway saved $2.6 million on lab tests over three years. Boeing also contracts directly with health systems in Washington and California for some employee care, bypassing insurers. But neither Boeing nor Safeway is likely to have the fearsome arm-twisting clout of this new conglomerate. The pharmaceutical industry knows it will need Amazon to deliver drugs. Hospitals might want Chase to finance equipment purchases. And who would dare alienate Warren Buffett, who has called health care costs ""a hungry tapeworm on the American economy""? The three titans are also likely to insist that the best hospitals — the Sloan Ketterings and Cleveland Clinics — be available to their workers. Yes, they may use technology in smarter ways to benefit patients. This might include home monitoring of heart rhythms and blood sugar; diagnosing via telemedicine and iPad; delivering prescription medicines to doorsteps; and bringing medicine into the 21st century with online billing and payment. They may also be able to provide employees some degree of pricing transparency so that they can make better choices. In doing so they will probably be able to reduce the high administrative costs associated with our health care system, an estimated 25 percent of hospital spending, and give patients more control of their care. How can the rest of us get in on the deal? If the new health care company permits outside firms and individuals to buy into whatever they create, that could set off a revolution. That new company would, essentially, become a novel insurer — although one that is cheaper, more efficient and patient-friendly. And that could be good for the entire health care system. But what if the three corporations try to turn their health care company into a profit center? This week's announcement said the new company is ""free from profit-making incentives and constraints."" That doesn't quite say ""nonprofit."" If the long-term game plan of the Amazon-JPMorgan-Berkshire offshoot is to function as a business that is sold to the rest of us to please shareholders, then we may end up pretty much back where we started. And that is not where we want to be."

What's happening: Ms. Johnson, who's currently the home-rental company's chief business affairs and legal officer, will become its chief operating officer. Meanwhile, Mr. Tosi, who had been Airbnb's chief financial officer since coming over from Blackstone, will leave the company to focus on his investment fund. Airbnb has hired a search firm to find a new C.F.O. Ellie Mertz, the company's head of global financial planning, will fill in that role on an interim basis. Between the lines • Ms. Johnson had been a rising star at Airbnb, often compared to Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg as the company's business-minded grown-up in the room. • Mr. Tosi had been increasingly at odds with Airbnb's C.E.O., Brian Chesky, over strategy.

Facebook's quarterly results, released Wednesday, provide crucial information for better understanding the balance of power between Silicon Valley titans and the democracies of Europe. The results clearly showed the importance of the European market to Facebook's future growth. The company's average revenue per European user in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $8.86, well below the $26.76 that Facebook rakes in per user in the United States and Canada. Facebook should be able to move that European number a lot higher in the coming years. Europe's economy is only a bit smaller than the United States', and the Continent contains prosperous nations whose citizens are just as addicted to social media as Americans. Indeed, Facebook has more daily active users in Europe than in the United States and Canada (277 million versus 184 million.) What is more, total European daily active users grew in the fourth quarter, while the United States and Canada number edged lower. All this helps explain why the growth in European revenue per user, at nearly 50 percent in the fourth quarter versus the year-earlier period, is significantly higher than the 35 percent rate for the United States and Canada. What does this mean for Facebook as European countries introduce measures aimed at protecting their citizens that may go beyond what the company is used to in the United States? Given how lucrative Europe is and will be to Facebook, it may be willing to spend what it takes to comply with new regulations, and even tolerate any inefficiencies the rules impose on its advertising business. Indeed, Facebook itself says it wants to make its network safer for users and democracies. But if there is any slip in that stance, Europe's leaders, seeing how important their countries are to Facebook's bottom line, arguably have considerable leverage to respond. — Peter Eavis Its price on Thursday: $8,915 Its all-time high hit on Dec. 18: $19,511.

To put the Bitcoin's recent slide in perspective, the cryptocurrency has lost $44 billion in market value last month, according to Bloomberg. The tumble has continued so far in February.

Details, including when and if a deal will come to fruition, remain scant at this point. The context Saudi Arabia is seeking to diversify its economy away from oil, and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has made developing Saudi Arabia's tech sector a key part of his ""Vision 2030"" plan. In late 2016, he traveled to Silicon Valley to promote those reforms, and the kingdom has taken bigger steps in recent years into the tech investing world. That year Saudi Arabia poured $3.5 billion into Uber, and its Public Investment Fund put $45 billion into SoftBank's $100 billion Vision Fund, which is making eye-popping investments in tech companies. An interesting point, from the WSJ article: It isn't clear how setting up tech hubs could fundamentally transform an oil company into a tech company — and therefore command a higher multiple — but it'd be interesting to see bankers make that argument. — Stephen Grocer The former G.E. chairman and C.E.O. will focus on tech and health care companies in his new role as a partner at N.E.A., one of the biggest V.C. firms in the world (that isn't named SoftBank).

2,2018-02-01," In the United States, most working-age people get their health insurance through work. It's a weird, kludgy system, largely an artifact of history. Economists, politicians and workers alike complain that the setup is inefficient and maddening.  Now, three very big and powerful companies — Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway — plan to use that system to transform health care, at least for their million-plus combined employees.  This idea is not as revolutionary as it might first seem. Some experts view the employer health system, despite its flaws, as a force for innovation and reform. Aggressive employers have pushed for experiments in health benefits, and they have tested ideas that the government and private insurance companies have shied away from.  It was companies, not insurers, that began experimenting with paying extra for intense primary care for the sickest patients. Companies first developed on-site health care for their workers: Kaiser Permanente was born as a medical clinic for workers building the Colorado River Aqueduct. Companies, including Lowe's and Walmart, pioneered programs that paid for patients to travel to premier centers for very expensive operations. California has tried tying insurance coverage to the price of a high-quality provider for state workers. Each of these efforts has been tied to measurable reductions in the cost of medical care.  ""To the extent that you have seen innovation by insurers, it's often at the behest of employers,"" said Jonathan Kolstad, an associate professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies the industry. The announcement on Tuesday by Amazon, Chase and Berkshire, though short on details, generated a lot of hope and investor enthusiasm. There are reasons to be skeptical that the companies will be able to make a big dent in their workers' health spending. But if the companies succeed, they will be harnessing the advantages and opportunities of a much maligned part of American health care. Companies started offering health coverage broadly during World War II, when the government imposed wage controls. And the system was cemented when the Internal Revenue Service decided that health insurance was not subject to income taxes, making it a particularly valuable way for employers to improve compensation for their workers.  Critics point to numerous problems with the system: It relies on company leaders to pick health insurance for all workers, even though C-suite executives might have preferences different from their lower-wage employees. It diminishes incentives to reduce costs, by insulating workers from the full price of their benefits. It discourages changes that could displease even a small number of workers, creating incentives to minimize disruption. ""I don't see any reason for the employer to be doing this,"" said Fiona Scott Morton, a health economist at the Yale School of Management. But the employer system also has points in its favor. For one, proponents note employers have multiple incentives to get health insurance right. They want their workers to be happy with their full slate of compensation — an employer that offered deceptive plans, for instance, might not hold onto good employees for long. Employers also want workers who are healthy and productive, able to work hard and to focus on their work. Employers tend to be insulated from the political considerations that can make it hard for government plans or large insurers to try new strategies. Large companies are able to pool risks, since they tend to cover both healthy and sick employees and family members. Because employers pay a large share of insurance premiums, most workers tend to sign up for plans even if they're healthy. Employers with people who stick around a long time — think police departments or universities — have an additional incentive to prevent their workers' health from deteriorating over time. Insurance is also very hard for individuals to buy. A long list of studies has shown that consumers struggle to understand basic insurance concepts like deductibles, have difficulty selecting a good health plan, avoid shopping, and often choose a plan that is clearly inferior to other options. Large employers have the resources to hire human resources professionals and benefits consultants to shop for their health plans. At least theoretically, those people should know more about how to pick a good health insurance plan that will serve the needs of the company's workers. And the bigger the companies, the more they can pay to hire people really good to do that work, since their salary gets split many times over. Have employers used these advantages to find huge savings? Not over all. Employer health insurance tends to be more expensive than public insurance, and its growth has traditionally followed the trajectory of other parts of the health industry. Some employers simply select from standard offerings, essentially outsourcing any innovation potential to notoriously risk-averse insurance companies. But there is also a robust history of employer experimentation. Some employer ideas have paid off — and spread. Others have flopped. Amazon and friends would be building on this tradition. Arnold Milstein, a professor at Stanford Medical School, spent several years with the benefits consulting firm Mercer developing unconventional benefit products with companies.  ""There is a segment of them that is willing to take the same risk tolerance that characterizes their core business and move it into the health benefit space,"" he said, noting that many employers ""are pretty wary, but there is a subset that has been more bold."" There have been less successful innovations. Workplace ""wellness"" programs, which provide financial incentives for lifestyle changes, were initially built and bought by employers. But a growing body of evidence suggests they haven't delivered much in the way of results. Amazon, Chase and Berkshire Hathaway have said they're experimenting with new health care models for their workers. If they crack the notoriously hard nut of high health care costs, we can thank the country's weird and unloved employer health system for their discovery."

4,2018-02-01," Can private businesses solve public policy problems better than the government? It's a question that has persisted for decades and taken on new resonance now that a career businessman is in the White House. There has never been a clear answer. For every sign of success — a smooth privatized toll road or a gleaming charter school — there have been obstacles revealing just how difficult public works can be. But companies haven't stopped trying. Just this past week, the ambitions reached new heights when three of today's most successful business leaders said they would form an independent company aimed at lowering the burden that health care places on the economy while improving the system for their employees. In a brief statement that provided virtually no details, the chief executives of Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase said they were fed up with the state of the health care system, and were convinced they could do better themselves. ""The ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,"" said Warren E. Buffett, the head of Berkshire Hathaway. ""Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable."" Joining Mr. Buffett were Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan. Together, the three men have revolutionized industries, forged empires and navigated all manner of crises. But can they fix health care? In announcing they would try, they delivered an implicit rebuke of the complex and costly American health care system, suggesting that the best minds in business could do better. ""Companies are now thinking much more about how to solve larger social problems,"" said Aaron Chatterji, a professor at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business. ""When Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan, three leaders in their industries, looked around, they realized that health care is a big issue facing them all."" Their efforts stem from a feeling that, with partisan bickering and constant campaigning consuming Washington, the onus is on businesses to fill the void left by an ineffective government. Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, acknowledged recently that a new imperative was challenging corporations. Government has ""become less functional and isn't working at the speed that it once was,"" he told The New York Times last year. ""And so it does fall, I think, not just on business but on all other areas of society to step up."" The notion that big business might shape government policy is nothing new, of course. Lobbyists have been working to sway lawmakers for decades, and the corporate world was an influential force in the tax overhaul passed last year. Yet for the most part, these efforts were narrowly aligned with a company's self-interest, usually in the form of lowering taxes and loosening regulations. And rarely have business leaders tried to assume operational control of a government function, let alone something as complex and unwieldy as health care. In recent years, however, more chief executives have begun speaking out on issues that at first glance have little to do with the bottom line, including immigration policy, climate change and gay rights. Corporate leaders have banded together to protest laws targeting transgender and gay rights in Indiana, North Carolina and Texas. And last year, as President Trump rolled out strict immigration rules, executives spoke out against the effort, with some, like the Google co-founder Sergey Brin, joining protesters at airports. ""The lack of leadership on the national political level has left this vacuum,"" said Kathleen Clark, a professor at the Washington University Law school. ""Fortunately, there are some business leaders who see that there's a role for them to play."" The most vivid expression of this new willingness to speak out came last summer after white supremacists marched on Charlottesville, Va., and Mr. Trump equivocated in his response to the violence. In a matter of days, top executives at the nation's largest companies issued statements condemning racism and denouncing Mr. Trump's response, and the president's business advisory councils were disbanded. Chief executives may seem like unlikely ethical leaders; Wells Fargo, Equifax, Uber and many more companies have faced questions from Congress about practices that have harmed consumers and in some instances cost taxpayers billions of dollars. But companies have also been wading into moral debates for decades. General Motors and Pepsi pulled out of South Africa during the apartheid era. Apple, Disney and Xerox were early in extending health care benefits to gay and lesbian couples. Similar efforts by chief executives today recall ""an earlier era of corporate statesmanship,"" said Lee Drutman, a fellow at New America, a research and policy institute. ""A lot of these business leaders viewed a business as having a somewhat broader public mission."" Now, he said, thanks to ""the rise, over the last 15 years, of the importance of social responsibly and social mission, there is a broad movement in business."" Even Amazon's much-publicized efforts to select a city for a second headquarters could, in a roundabout way, influence local policymakers. Given that the company is unlikely to set up shop in a state with socially conservative laws that might alienate some employees, ""Amazon could have an effect not just on prices but on what legislators pass,"" Mr. Chatterji said. Other examples of ambitious efforts by top executives to tackle social problems aren't hard to find. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, made an ill-fated attempt to reform the public schools of Newark, N.J. Elon Musk has audacious plans to build a futuristic high-speed transportation network connecting cities in the Northeast. And billionaires across the political spectrum — from Tom Steyer on the left to the Koch brothers on the right — are spending heavily to sway public policy to their liking. The wealthiest corporate titans are also using their philanthropy to shape public policy, in the United States and beyond. Microsoft's co-founder Bill Gates, through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, is working on myriad initiatives that might plausibly be done by governments, including efforts to curb tobacco use, slow the spread of H.I.V. and improve education in Washington State. George Soros, through his Open Society Foundations, has been promoting democratic ideals around the globe. And Mr. Zuckerberg, through the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, is working on ambitious long-term projects involving science, education and justice. There is a big difference, though, between supporting social causes and research and operating a sprawling public works system. Critics will contend that some of these efforts smack of arrogance, and that businesses ought to stay in their lane and focus on offering excellent products and services, not meddle in public policy. ""There is this hubris, thinking that they can do it better,"" Mr. Chatterji said. There is also a certain irony to the fact that Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan said the new company they had formed would be ""free from profit-making incentives and constraints."" The profit motive, after all, is what leads to efficiency and innovation, according to conventional business school wisdom. Operating as a nonprofit ""flies in the face of the logic of the capitalist economy,"" Mr. Chatterji said. It most likely will take years to determine if the three companies can make good on their promise of building a better health care system. Even if they succeed, the rewards may be limited to their employees — a large figure, but a small portion of the American work force. Nonetheless, the companies' push is among the most audacious efforts by the private sector to date, and Mr. Dimon did not shy away from the scope of their ambition. ""The three of our companies have extraordinary resources,"" he said on Tuesday when the initiative was announced. ""Our goal is to create solutions that benefit our U.S. employees, their families and, potentially, all Americans."""
5,2018-02-01," LONDON — What if your employer made you wear a wristband that tracked your every move, and that even nudged you via vibrations when it judged that you were doing something wrong? What if your supervisor could identify every time you paused to scratch or fidget, and for how long you took a bathroom break? What may sound like dystopian fiction could become a reality for Amazon warehouse workers around the world. The company has won two patents for such a wristband, though it was unclear if Amazon planned to actually manufacture the tracking device and have employees wear it. The online retail giant, which plans to build a second headquarters and recently shortlisted 20 potential host cities for it, has also been known to experiment in-house with new technology before selling it worldwide. Amazon, which rarely discloses information on its patents, could not immediately be reached for comment on Thursday. But the patent disclosure goes to the heart about a global debate about privacy and security. Amazon already has a reputation for a  workplace culture that thrives on a hard-hitting management style, and has experimented with how far it can push white-collar workers in order to reach its delivery targets. Privacy advocates, however, note that a lot can go wrong even with everyday tracking technology. On Monday, the tech industry was jolted by the discovery that Strava, a fitness app that allows users to track their activities and compare their performance with other people running or cycling in the same places, had unwittingly highlighted the locations of United States military bases and the movements of their personnel in Iraq and Syria. The patent applications, filed in 2016, were published in September, and Amazon won them this week, according to GeekWire, which  reported the patents' publication on Tuesday. In theory, Amazon's proposed technology would emit ultrasonic sound pulses and radio transmissions to track where an employee's hands were in relation to inventory bins, and provide ""haptic feedback"" to steer the worker toward the correct bin. The aim, Amazon says in the patent, is to streamline ""time consuming"" tasks, like responding to orders and packaging them for speedy delivery. With guidance from a wristband, workers could fill orders faster. Critics say such wristbands raise concerns about privacy and would add a new layer of surveillance to the workplace, and that the use of the devices could result in employees being treated more like robots than human beings. Current and former Amazon employees said the company already used similar tracking technology in its warehouses and said they would not be surprised if it put the patents into practice. Max Crawford, a former Amazon warehouse worker in Britain, said in a phone interview, ""After a year working on the floor, I felt like I had become a version of the robots I was working with."" He described having to process hundreds of items in an hour — a pace so extreme that one day, he said, he fell over from dizziness. ""There was no time to go to the loo,"" he said, using the British slang for toilet. ""You had to process the items in seconds and then move on. If you didn't meet targets, you were fired."" He worked back and forth at two Amazon warehouses for more than two years and then quit in 2015 because of health concerns, he said: ""I got burned out."" Mr. Crawford agreed that the wristbands might save some time and labor, but he said the tracking was ""stalkerish"" and feared that workers might be unfairly scrutinized if their hands were found to be ""in the wrong place at the wrong time."" ""They want to turn people into machines,"" he said. ""The robotic technology isn't up to scratch yet, so until it is, they will use human robots."" Many companies file patents for products that never see the light of day. And Amazon would not be the first employer to push boundaries in the search for a more efficient, speedy work force. Companies are increasingly introducing artificial intelligence into the workplace to help with productivity, and technology is often used to monitor employee whereabouts. One company in London is developing artificial intelligence systems to flag unusual workplace behavior, while another used a messaging application to track its employees. In Wisconsin, a technology company called Three Square Market offered employees an opportunity to have microchips implanted under their skin in order, it said, to be able to use its services seamlessly. Initially, more than 50 out of 80 staff members at its headquarters in River Falls, Wis., volunteered."

That's either the setup to a bad joke or the start of a revolution in American health care — but for now, nobody knows the punch line.

And so despite the dearth of details, the announcement made a splash in the business world, prompting optimism that someone may finally be on the verge of reforming the expensive and complex health care industry.

In that vein: Tune in for Bezos's star turn in Amazon's Super Bowl commercial on Sunday. Amazon's rep rehab happened in a year in which tech companies have been hammered in the media, none more so than Facebook. Now Facebook is turning a new leaf, according to Mark Zuckerberg.

2,2018-02-02," SEATTLE — For Apple and Amazon, the holidays are the time to shine, the period when shoppers have the greatest appetite to buy their devices and, in Amazon's case, anything else that can be stuffed into a box and delivered to homes. During the final few months of last year, neither disappointed. Both companies singled out the booming sales of their devices in the quarterly financial results that they reported on Thursday. Apple boasted of its highest revenue ever for a new lineup of iPhones, which included the high-priced iPhone X. Amazon raved about the demand for gadgets like the Echo, which runs its intelligent voice assistant, Alexa. ""Our 2017 projections for Alexa were very optimistic, and we far exceeded them,"" Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, said. ""We don't see positive surprises of this magnitude very often — expect us to double down."" Amazon, a company once known for routinely posting losses, more than doubled its profit thanks to strong growth in its cloud computing division and a newer business for the company — advertising. It also benefited from a large gain resulting from changes to the United States tax code. For the quarter that ended Dec. 31, Amazon said, net income rose to $1.86 billion, the highest profit in its history and more than double the $749 million from a year earlier. A big part of the increase, $789 million, came from the tax benefit. Revenue jumped 38 percent to $60.45 billion from a year earlier. Amazon's shares soared nearly 6 percent in after-hours trading following the release of the results. ""Amazon's best-in-class large-cap growth story remains unchanged,"" Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Company, wrote in a research report. While Amazon's online store sales grew 20 percent from a year earlier, the company's total retail growth benefited from its acquisition of Whole Foods Markets. That deal, announced in June, added much of the $4.52 billion in physical store revenue for the quarter. Yet the biggest revenue growth came from a category generically named ""other,"" which includes advertising services and rose 62 percent to $1.74 billion from a year earlier. By far the most profitable big business for the company was Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing unit. Its revenue rose 45 percent to $5.11 billion, and its operating income increased 46 percent to $1.35 billion. Amazon kept with its tradition of secrecy by refusing to reveal exactly how many of its Echo family of devices it sold, saying only that it sold ""tens of millions"" of them last year. The company priced the devices aggressively over the holidays — its cheapest was only $29. The devices probably did not yield much profit, though they are an important part of Amazon's effort to establish a technology ecosystem that could result in other benefits, such as enabling customers to make impulse purchases with their voices. Apple, in contrast, is without equal in making profits from tech hardware. For the company's fiscal first quarter, it reported a record for quarterly net income — $20.07 billion, up 12 percent from a year earlier. Revenue rose 13 percent to $88.3 billion. The gains were notable considering that Apple's fiscal first quarter was a week shorter than the previous year's 14-week fiscal first quarter. While Amazon is content to price its devices near its costs for making them, Apple is known for charging a premium for its smartphones, tablets and computers. The iPhone X, which uses facial recognition to unlock the device, is the most expensive in its history, starting at almost $1,000. ""Customer satisfaction is literally off the charts on iPhone X,"" Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, said on the company's earnings call. Mr. Cook noted that the iPhone X was the company's top-selling phone in the quarter despite its November release, roughly a month and a half after Apple's other new iPhones. The company sold 77.3 million iPhones over the quarter, which was down 1 percent from the longer quarter a year earlier. Yet revenue was higher largely because of the pricing of the new iPhones: In addition to introducing the iPhone X, Apple raised the price of the base model of its iPhone to $699, up from the $649 starting price for past iPhones. Sales in its ""other products"" category, which includes the Apple Watch, grew 36 percent to $5.5 billion. Apple declined to disclose sales of the Apple Watch for competitive reasons, but Mr. Cook noted on the earnings call that revenue for the Apple Watch had grown 50 percent. Apple also highlighted money generated from services, which include the App Store and Apple Music, with revenue rising 18 percent to $8.5 billion. Apple said the App Store continued to be the top destination for smartphone customers to buy apps. Apple sold 13.2 million iPads, up 1 percent — notable because iPad sales declined for many consecutive quarters over the last few years. But Mac sales shrank about 5 percent to 5.1 million units. Despite strong sales of the pricey iPhone X, some analysts remained concerned that its sales were slowing. Ahead of the earnings call, some news reports said Apple was slashing production of the iPhone X for the quarter that ends in March. The reports cited supply chain partners that said Apple had cut orders for parts. But in years past, Apple has warned investors that activities of its complex supply chain were an unreliable metric for overall sales. The company also typically slows down iPhone production after the holiday quarter, which is the peak shopping season. Last month, Apple also unveiled plans to bring the vast majority of its $252 billion in cash held abroad back to the United States, paying a one-time repatriation tax of $38 billion. Because the company had already earmarked $36.4 billion in anticipation that it would eventually have to pay taxes on its foreign earnings, Apple did not see much impact from the recent tax code changes. Luca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer, said that in light of the new tax code, the company would announce plans for its repatriated cash, including dividends and buybacks, in April."
0,2018-02-03," After Jian Ghomeshi was fired as the host of a popular C.B.C. Radio program in 2014 and then arrested on five charges related to sexual assault, the hashtag #BeenRapedNeverReported quickly appeared on Twitter. The movement lost its momentum despite prompting some Canadian news organizations, particularly The Globe and Mail, to look deeply into how the police in Canada deal with sexual assault complaints. (Mr. Ghomeshi was found not guilty on all charges after a judge said that he had doubt about the testimony from his accusers.) Now the #MeToo and #Time'sUp movements that emerged from revelations published in The New York Times about the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and other powerful men in the United States have refocused Canada's attention. On Monday, I was in the House of Commons as it debated legislation that would extend legal protection against sexual harassment to Parliament Hill staff members, a group of mostly young people whose jobs put them automatically into a power imbalance. Afterward, in the lobby, reporters peppered politicians, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, with questions f about the turmoil that has descended on Canada's political world because of sexual harassment. I asked Jessica Bennett, the gender editor of The Times and the author of ""Feminist Fight Club,"" about how the rethinking of sexual harassment had spread to Canada and much of the rest of the world. Ms. Bennett updates and analyzes the current debate each week in The #MeToo Moment newsletter. Q. While he was unquestionably powerful in Hollywood, Harvey Weinstein was not a household name in Canada until last fall. Why has his downfall set off debate and action in Canada and elsewhere outside of the United States? A. I actually think it was less about Weinstein and more about the women who chose to speak out. This was one of the few, perhaps only, cases in recent history where the victims were vastly more famous than the abuser — and I think that was one of the many factors that contributed to the explosion. Social media played a part in the ripple effect, continuing to spread the message and to shift the conversation away from those famous women to the rest of us. And the rest of us are key to this. The #MeToo movement has sustained because sexual assault and harassment is a universal experience. While debating sexual harassment legislation in Parliament this week, some of the legislators expressed concern that the #MeToo movement might flame out as rapidly as it rose up. What will it take to affect sustained changes? I think we've already seen that that's not the case. As journalists, we so often wait for when reader fatigue sets in, when our audience tires of a particular story line or the next scoop comes along. That truly hasn't happened in this case. The stories keep coming, the complicity continues to be uncovered, and the major shift I've seen is the focus from pure accusations to what's next. In what ways has policy not kept up with the times? If we know that most sexual harassment training doesn't work — which we do — how will institutions work to eradicate the behavior? I don't think this conversation is going away, but I do think it will shift from problem to solution. Are Americans paying any attention to the debates in Canada and elsewhere in the world? I think that social media has helped keep the conversation global. In France it was #BalanceTonPorc, in Spain and Latin America #YoTambien, in Italy #QuellaVoltaChe, in Israel #גםאנחנו—#MeToo has stretched from Canada to China. Ms. Bennett will be coming to Toronto on Feb. 21, along with Jodi Kantor and Emily Steel, The Times journalists who broke the Harvey Weinstein and Bill O'Reilly stories, for a discussion about the current social reckoning. It will be moderated by Catherine Porter, the Toronto bureau chief, and held at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto. You can order tickets here, and there is a special price for Times subscribers. Through the Reader Center, Ms. Kantor is also asking readers for examples of changes they've seen or experienced on how sexual harassment is being dealt with and would welcome your contributions.

1,2018-02-03," Amazon and Walmart are battling to dominate the grocery market, fueling a price war that could rearrange where America shops for food. To get a firsthand glimpse of this competition, we have periodically been testing Amazon's effect on grocery prices since the online retailer bought Whole Foods last summer.  Heading into Super Bowl weekend, we thought we would compare the price of ingredients for Steak 'n' Bacon Cheddar meatballs. So we shopped for the same items (or as close as we could find) at a Whole Foods and a Walmart. Our experiment was inspired by the opening of the Whole Foods 365 brand store in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn on Wednesday — the first 365 store on the East Coast. Whole Foods promotes the stores as a less costly option for shoppers. Our plan was to bake one batch of the cheesy, three-meat delicacy using only ingredients from a Walmart and a second batch with only items from the Whole Foods 365. Then we would ask our newsroom colleagues which version of the meatball — described by the chef who created it as ""the heart stopper"" — tasted better. While the 365 line of stores was launched before Amazon's acquisition, the vibe of the new Brooklyn store seems in keeping with Amazon's consumer-first approach. The store is easy to navigate and pushes its private-label, and less expensive, 365 brand products.  Wherever possible, we bought 365 brand items, including steak, hamburger, salt, pepper and olive oil. Many of the items were organic, and the eggs came from cage-free chickens. That helped drive up the prices.  The grand total: $45.17 Next, we went to the Walmart Supercenter in Secaucus, N.J., and bought almost entirely from Walmart's Great Value brand, which offers few organic options. That bill came to $27.18 One ingredient that drove that difference: Whole Foods' organic shredded Cheddar cost nearly three times as much as the Walmart brand, which was not organic. The price of a dozen eggs at the two stores was comparable. For the highly unscientific taste test, we served the meatballs in the New York Times newsroom on Friday afternoon. The taste testers were not told whether they had chosen a Whole Foods or a Walmart meatball until after they voted. Some said the Whole Foods batch had too much bacon flavor. Others found the steak bits in the Walmart meatballs too chewy. When the votes were tallied, the Whole Foods meatball prevailed. But by the end of the day, the distinctions seemed to fade. Every meatball had been eaten."
0,2018-02-04," Allen Gillespie is one lonely stock analyst. Of the dozens of Wall Street analysts covering Amazon, he is the only one tracked by Bloomberg who recommends that investors sell the company's shares. Mr. Gillespie, a partner at FinTrust Investment Advisors, a wealth management firm in Greenville, S.C., questions whether Amazon deserves such a stratospheric share price. ""Everybody thinks I am crazy,"" said Mr. Gillespie, who also serves on the board overseeing South Carolina's pension fund. ""I have had people I've never met email me to ask if I was serious."" It is a bold call indeed. Since Mr. Gillespie put a sell rating on the company last July, Amazon's shares have increased 37 percent, to $1,429. On Friday, one day after Amazon reported the biggest quarterly profit in its history, Amazon's market value briefly crossed the $700 billion mark, and its share price increased 3 percent even as the Dow fell 2.5 percent. For most analysts, the end is not yet in sight. When the investment firm D.A. Davidson & Company predicted last month that Amazon's shares could rise to $1,800, Morgan Stanley upped the ante the next day, forecasting a possible $2,100 share price. ""It's an infatuation,"" said Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University's Stern business school, who recently published a book about Amazon, Google and other tech giants. How that infatuation developed is the story of a company that figured out how to tame Wall Street. In a business environment that demands, and rewards, quarterly profits and short-term strategic thinking, Amazon showed extraordinary resolve in focusing on long-term goals, somehow persuading investors to go along. Over its first decade in existence, including long stretches where it consistently reported losses, Amazon enjoyed a luxury afforded few companies: leeway. ""I think it comes down to a consistent message and consistent strategy, one that doesn't deviate when the stock goes down or goes up,"" said Bill Miller, the chief investment officer at Miller Value Partners, whose largest holding is Amazon. In part, Amazon has inured itself to pressure from Wall Street by ignoring it. While many chief executives devote significant time to fielding questions from investors, Amazon's founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is famously stingy about the time he spends with major stockholders. He hasn't appeared on an Amazon earnings calls in years. In a 2014 interview with Business Insider, Mr. Bezos said he spent a measly six hours a year on investor relations and then only with long-term shareholders, who have been willing to weather the company's ups and downs. Mr. Miller is one of them. Mr. Bezos has constantly reminded the market of his philosophy. Each year in the company's annual letter to shareholders, Amazon attaches a copy of the very first letter from 1997, its first as a publicly traded company. ""We will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations rather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions,"" Mr. Bezos wrote in a section of the letter titled, ""It's All About the Long Term.'' Mr. Bezos has been true to his word. Amazon has reported an annual profit in only 13 of the 21 years that it has operated as a publicly traded company, according to FactSet, a financial data firm. And its profit margins, already low by some measures, have fluctuated from year to year — hardly moving in the straight upward line that Wall Street usually likes to see. Yet investors have rewarded Amazon for plowing its profits back into growing its businesses, whether in online retail, cloud computing or, most recently, in grocery stores, with the acquisition of Whole Foods Market. An Amazon spokesman declined to comment. It may sound like a Pollyanna view of stock investing, particularly in a market increasingly dominated by trading algorithms and macro bets on the direction of interest rates. But in the case of Amazon, it is actually true. ""If Wall Street would allow more companies to reinvest like Amazon, it would create great benefits for the economy,"" said Henry Blodget, a former stock analyst, who first came to prominence in 1998 by setting a $400 price target for Amazon shares. (He is now editorial director of the online publication Business Insider, in which Mr. Bezos was an investor.) The reality of the economy, however, is that most other companies are still playing by Wall Street's old rules, which demand consistent profit growth. And to compete with Amazon and meet those profit expectations, many retailers and manufacturers are laying off workers, closing stores and shedding factories. Last month, Kimberly-Clark, under pricing pressure from Amazon and Walmart, said it was laying off more than 5,000 workers and closing or selling 10 of its factories. It wasn't always so easy for Amazon. During the tech boom of the late 1990s, Amazon was one of a number of promising tech start-ups that were losing money. But it showed the potential for longer term profit, as it moved from selling books into music and toys. But like the rest of the tech sector, Amazon's shares tumbled in 2000 and 2001 as investors began to wonder if these companies could ever make money. A young debt analyst at Lehman Brothers warned in June 2000 that Amazon might soon run out of cash, causing investors to worry about its survival. Mr. Bezos had squirreled away enough capital to get through those dark days. But it took many years for investors who had been burned by the dot-com crash to give Amazon a second chance. For long stretches from 2002 to 2006, Amazon's stock price languished, while it invested in researching and developing new technologies and businesses. Mark Mahaney, a tech analyst at RBC Capital Markets, looked at the company's slipping profit margins during that period and warned investors to stay away. Mr. Mahaney said he failed to realize ""that all that spending on R.&D. was a bullish sign for the future."" He has had a buy rating on the company for more than a decade. Those long-term investments, which Amazon didn't detail at the time, eventually gave rise to some of the company's most profitable businesses, like its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services. The success of the cloud computing business proved a tipping point. If investors allowed Amazon to spend time and money investing, patience would pay off. Investors are now awaiting the payoff from Amazon's foray into groceries with its $13 billion acquisition of Whole Foods last spring. How it plans to integrate hundreds of brick and mortar stores with its core e-commerce business is far from clear. By now, Wall Street has been well trained to believe that Amazon has a strategy for Whole Foods and it will take time to carry it out. ""What the market finally figured out is Amazon is extremely good at investing those dollars,"" said Mr. Miller, the investment officer at Miller Value Partners. Ultimately, much of the investor confidence in Amazon reflects a belief in its future opportunity — what investors frequently call a company's ""addressable market."" For Amazon, the addressable market in retail is roughly $5 trillion in the United States and many times that globally, Mr. Miller said. And that's not even including the traditional information technology market that Amazon Web Services is attacking. ""I asked Jeff what the addressable market is for A.W.S.,"" Mr. Miller said. ""He just looked at me and said, 'Trillions and trillions.'"" Online spending represents less than 10 percent of total retail spending, and Amazon captures almost half of every dollar spent in online shopping by Americans. Even Mr. Gillespie, the skeptic, acknowledges that Amazon is ""operating extremely well."" But he questions whether years of low interest rates have helped inflate Amazon's value because investors are so starved for return, they are willing to overlook some of the risks. Those risks, he said, include regulators deciding the company is growing too large or not paying its fair share in taxes. ""People tend to assume away these things,"" he said."
0,2018-02-05," Q. I am blind, and I do not subscribe to any streaming video services at the moment. How would you suggest I determine, quickly, whether a good percentage of the original content and current popular third-party content on Netflix and Amazon Prime, for starters, is audio-described and/or dubbed? A. A good place to start is the Audio Description Project page on the website of the American Council of the Blind. The page, optimized for screen-reader software, has a running list of streaming services that offer videos with ""audio descriptions"" — added narration about scenes, characters, costumes and more — for people who cannot see what is happening. The list, which is updated regularly, is available at www.acb.org/adp/streaming.html. According to the council, Netflix has more than ""500 audio-described TV series, documentaries, original programming and children's shows in the U.S.A.,"" including most of the company's original productions, like ""House of Cards."" Although you must be a member to get access to Netflix's full list of current videos with audio descriptions, the council's site has compiled its own alphabetized list of audio-described Netflix content at www.acb.org/adp/netflixad.html. Amazon Prime Video has about 350 movies and TV shows with audio descriptions, including ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" and a number of popular theatrical films. The council's own tally of Amazon Prime shows is at acb.org/adp/amazonad.html. The Audio Description Project page notes several other streaming services and broadcast shows that are accessible, including Apple's iTunes Store for purchased and rented video. The WatchABC app for mobile devices and some set-top boxes has audio-described content. Some other video services have been slow to add audio descriptions, but as technology enables more accessibility with television, expect to hear of more available content. For the curious, sample clips with audio description can be found on YouTube."
0,2018-02-08," Q. How do you delete Kindle books you have finished on an iPad? A. When you have completed an e-book and are ready to remove it from your iPad, open the iOS Kindle app and go to your library screen that displays your collection. Tap the Downloaded button at the top of the screen to see only the books stored on the tablet. When you find the book you want to delete, swipe to the left and tap the red Archive button. For more options, you can instead press your finger on the cover image for a second until a menu appears. Choose Remove From Device to delete the book from the iPad. (You can dump old sample chapters and other free content from the Kindle app by selecting the Delete Permanently option from the menu instead.) Amazon keeps a record of all your content purchases in your online account with the company, which allows you to download and sync the same book across multiple devices running Kindle apps. Removing a book from the iPad does not delete it from your library of purchased books from Amazon's cloud servers, and you can download it to the iPad again if you ever want to reread it. To do that, tap the All button on your Kindle library screen to see all your purchases (not just the downloaded items). Tap the book cover to download it again. If you want to permanently delete a book from your Kindle collection stored in the Amazon cloud, log into your account on the company's site and go to the Manage Your Content and Devices page. You can get to it by clicking the triangle next to Your Account & Lists on the left side of the Amazon page and selecting Your Content and Devices. Next, click the Your Content tab. In the list, find the book you want to remove for good and click the Actions button next to the title. In the pop-up menu, click Delete. You should see a warning box asking you to confirm your decision, as deleting the book here permanently erases it from your cloud library and you will have to buy it again if you want to read it again."
0,2018-02-09," SEATTLE — Amazon is planning to test a program this year that would replace some delivery services now done by United Parcel Service and FedEx. Under the new service, known inside the company variously as Ship With Amazon and Shipping With Amazon, company couriers would pick up products from businesses that sell goods through the internet retailer and deliver that merchandise to Amazon warehouses. Now, those goods are delivered to the warehouses by UPS, FedEx and other companies. Amazon's test, which could start in several months, will probably include only a handful of independent Amazon sellers in Los Angeles. Eventually, the test could encompass more delivery services handled by established carriers. A person briefed on the program, who asked for anonymity because the plans are confidential, provided details about the project. When asked about the program, Amazon said in a statement, ""We're always innovating and experimenting on behalf of customers and the businesses that sell and grow on Amazon to create faster, lower-cost delivery choices."" In the initial trial of the service, the person briefed on the plan said, Amazon will still rely on its current network of couriers, like UPS, FedEx and the Postal Service, to get orders from its warehouses to customers. Depending on how the test goes, though, the service could expand to include more sellers in more areas and allow sellers that do not store their inventory in Amazon warehouses to ship orders entirely through Amazon's own delivery network, bypassing other carriers. In the long term, Amazon could also make the service available to merchants that sell on sites besides Amazon. That news helped send shares of both UPS and FedEx lower on Friday, after The Wall Street Journal reported on Amazon's plans for the test in Los Angeles. While some pundits have suggested that Amazon is on a course to kill FedEx and UPS, the reality is more complicated. On one level, there are unmistakable signs that the company is getting more deeply involved in shipping. Amazon operates a fleet of cargo jets and semi trucks to move merchandise around the country. It helps arrange the transportation of freight across the ocean on cargo ships from Chinese suppliers. It has even taken a more direct role in delivering orders to customers through local couriers. But Amazon also depends heavily on outside companies to deliver orders. The company's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, has said Amazon's business with carriers like UPS and the Postal Service is growing even as the company gets more involved. Amazon's own shipping services have given the company a way to keep up with the growth in its business, which is especially helpful during times, like the holidays, when its carrier partners are flooded with packages. Operating its own shipping services could also offer a way to negotiate better prices with outside delivery companies. Shipping costs at Amazon last year rose 34 percent to $21.7 billion, according to Amazon filings. Steve Gaut, a spokesman for UPS, declined to comment about Amazon's plans or whether the company's shipping volume with UPS had changed. He pointed out, however, that UPS reported 8 percent revenue growth and a 4.5 percent increase in package volume in the United States last year. ""UPS continues to support Amazon and all other valued customers,"" he said. Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Company, compared what Amazon was doing in shipping to what it had done in the corporate technology market with Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing business. Slowly over time, Amazon has added more and more features to the service, but they are still well short of the offerings from established providers like Microsoft. ""I think Amazon is going to find different areas within the logistics and transportation space where it can be maybe more effective or efficient than what FedEx and UPS can do,"" Mr. Sebastian said. ""That doesn't mean they're trying to establish a full competitor."""
1,2018-02-09," The NBC Entertainment executive Jennifer Salke was named the new head of Amazon Studios on Friday, ending a nearly four-month search that began when Roy Price was ousted after a sexual harassment allegation. Amazon had been on the hunt for a new executive, placing a strong emphasis on finding a woman, since October. In that time, streaming rivals like Netflix, Hulu and Apple have continued to gobble up television projects. Amazon has made the occasional splash at the Golden Globes and the Emmys with shows like ""Transparent"" and ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,"" but it has failed to gain the same kind of standing that Netflix and even Hulu have within Hollywood's creative community. It will be up to Ms. Salke, 53, to essentially hit the reset button. ""What stood out about Jen was the deep relationships she has nurtured with creators and talent over her career,"" Jeff Blackburn, Amazon's senior vice president for business development and entertainment, said in a statement. A Fox executive, Dana Walden, and an A&E executive, Nancy Dubuc, had discussed the position with Amazon before each dropped out of talks. ""I'm incredibly excited about the future at Amazon Studios,"" Ms. Salke said in a statement. ""In the studio's relatively short existence they have innovated, disrupted and created characters that are already an indelible part of pop culture. I am both honored and emboldened by the opportunity to lead this extraordinary business."" For the last seven years, Ms. Salke has been second in command at NBC, where she and Robert Greenblatt, chairman of NBC Entertainment, engineered an impressive turnaround. Mr. Greenblatt, who joined NBC in 2010, and Ms. Salke, who came on board as president from Fox in 2011, found a network in deep trouble and well past its ""Seinfeld,"" ""ER"" and ""Friends"" heyday. But now, propelled by ""Sunday Night Football"" and shows like ""This Is Us,"" ""The Voice"" and ""Will & Grace,"" NBC is poised to win the 18-to-49-year-old demographic among the four broadcast networks for a second consecutive season. Ms. Salke was one of the biggest champions of ""This Is Us,"" an emotional family drama whose popularity has surprised many industry veterans — as has its ability to sustain that success in its second season. On Sunday, NBC gave ""This Is Us"" the post-Super Bowl slot, where it garnered an impressive audience of 27 million viewers. Ms. Salke has also helped deploy a strategy that brought NBC's comedy lineup back to life. After the lineup collapsed when ""30 Rock"" and ""The Office"" went off the air, she said the network would develop comedies that weren't meant to appeal to everybody. NBC has since found traction with offbeat comedies like ""The Good Place"" and ""Superstore."" ""Jennifer Salke is a world-class entertainment executive and deserves enormous credit for helping put NBC back on top,"" Mr. Greenblatt said in a statement. But whether her success at helping turn around a broadcast network — which also relies on a healthy diet of Dick Wolf dramas — will translate to a streaming service is an open question. Amazon has been viewed in Hollywood as something of a sleeping giant, one of the few companies that could match Netflix financially if it deployed its cash properly. Netflix is poised to spend $8 billion on content this year. But Amazon has had several expensive missteps. ""The Last Tycoon,"" adapted from F. Scott Fitzgerald's unfinished novel, debuted to little fanfare and was canceled. Likewise, several comedies, including ""One Mississippi,"" ""Jean-Claude Van Johnson"" and ""I Love Dick,"" have been canceled in the last month. The streaming service was ready to introduce a revamp — an increased emphasis on shows that would appeal internationally, for instance — when Mr. Price was accused of sexual harassment by a producer on one of Amazon's shows. Mr. Price and his No. 2, Joe Lewis, were shown the door shortly after. One of Amazon's earliest successes, ""Transparent,"" has also gotten tripped up in the #MeToo movement. Jeffrey Tambor, the show's star, has been accused of sexual harassment, and it's not clear if he will return to the series. Mr. Price also invested heavily in Woody Allen, whose career appears to be in jeopardy because of the accusation, first made public more than 25 years ago, that he sexually abused his daughter Dylan. Amazon is considering ending its relationship with Mr. Allen. While Amazon was busy cleaning house, its rivals continued making moves. Apple has begun to buy up TV projects as it prepares to introduce a slate of original programming in the next year or two. Facebook and Google have likewise ramped up efforts to make a splash in the TV industry. At the same time, Hulu has found real momentum. It is introducing several shows this year, including ""The Looming Tower,"" a mini-series based on Lawrence Wright's book about the lead-up to the Sept. 11 attacks, this month and the second season of ""The Handmaid's Tale"" in April. In addition to shows like ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,"" ""The Man in the High Castle"" and ""Bosch,"" Ms. Salke will inherit one of the most expensive projects in TV history: an adaptation of ""The Lord of the Rings"" for the small screen. The show does not have a writer or producer attached yet. "
0,2018-02-10," LATHAM, N.Y. — By noon on Wednesday, the snow was ankle-deep in the parking lot and the workers had abandoned the factory floor at Plug Power to escape the storm. Hydrogen-powered fuel cells meant for forklifts in Amazon or Walmart warehouses sat half-finished in steel casings. The empty plant was a weather fluke, but to the 300 employees in this town outside Albany, it might have been an omen of the company's fate, which was resting in the hands of Washington lawmakers. The $1.5 trillion tax bill President Trump signed into law last year failed to extend a crucial tax credit for fuel-cell makers such as Plug Power, putting the company's domestic future in jeopardy. As workers drove home that afternoon to ride out the storm, a flurry of hope was swirling as Congress hashed out a bipartisan budget deal that company leaders hoped would reinstate the fuel-cell tax credit. An extension of the credit would allow Plug Power's executives to continue their recent expansion in the United States. Without it, the 20-year old company would shift resources to China and Germany, potentially leaving the workers here out in the cold. The giant tax bill ushered in the most significant changes to the tax code in decades, with the aim of helping businesses grow and flourish. But Washington has a long history of picking winners and losers through the tax code — even in bills meant to simplify it — and Plug Power's experience demonstrates just how much power Congress wields over companies who build businesses based in part on policy decisions. For more than two years, Plug Power's president and chief executive, Andy Marsh, had spent a chunk of his working hours advocating a long-term extension of the credit. The company spent more than $750,000 during that period to lobby Congress. Early in the day on Wednesday, Mr. Marsh said he was 65 percent certain the tax credit would make it into the budget deal. Around lunchtime, he put the odds at 35 percent. While Mr. Marsh prepared to follow his workers out the door, his chief operating officer, Keith Schmid, took a visitor on a last walk across the now-silent plant. ""I'm a little spooked by how quiet it is today,"" he said. An hour later, his reprieve arrived. Congress cut a deal to extend the credit. For years, Washington has set tax policy in fits and starts, creating targeted tax breaks for particular industries and often setting them to expire, to minimize the projected loss to federal revenues. Yet those credits are routinely extended on a temporary basis, creating a maddening dance for companies who struggle to plan and invest for the long term. Economists generally agree that the process is detrimental to companies and the economy. Expiring tax breaks give companies an incentive to plow money into lobbying to retain those preferences, rather than putting that money toward research and development, worker training or other investments that might improve their productivity. Free-market purists also contend that targeted tax breaks distort markets, propping up firms that otherwise might fail, just because they have government connections. But try as they might, policymakers in Washington cannot quit the short-term credit game. In 2005, President George W. Bush signed a law that created a 30 percent credit for investing in fuel cells, which combine hydrogen and oxygen to create an electric current. Congress extended the credit twice after that. But it eventually set the credit, along with similar incentives for solar, wind and other clean energy sources, to expire at the end of 2016. Industry lobbyists worked hard to prevent the expiration, and in 2015, lawmakers extended some solar and wind credits but allowed the fuel cell credit to die as scheduled. The industries whose credits expired never stopped working to get them back. Some members of Congress took up their cause, such as Representative Tom Reed, Republican of New York, who drafted a bill to reinstate — and gradually phase out — the energy credits that had been ""orphaned"" by the 2015 bill. Mr. Reed nearly succeeded in getting those extensions attached to the sprawling tax bill that Republicans sped through Congress last fall. But his provision was dropped from the bill as it moved through the Senate, and thus never made it to Mr. Trump for his signature. The disappearance of the credit threatened the domestic expansion of Plug Power, a company founded in the late 1990s in the midst of the tech boom, whose stock briefly topped $1,000 a share. The bubble popped, the firm's shares sunk to single digits and the company burned through money, seeking a marketable use for its fuel cells, which cost more than conventional competitors but emit nothing but water as a byproduct. Mr. Marsh took over in 2008 and finally steered the firm into what has become a profitable niche: replacing the large batteries that power forklifts in warehouses. Forklifts that run on fuel cells do not need to swap out batteries every shift, like those that run on lead-acid batteries. They plug into a fuel station that looks like a gasoline pump, connect a few hoses and quickly fill up with hydrogen. Plug Power has found a growing market in selling or leasing those fuel cells to Amazon, Walmart, Kroger and B.M.W., among others, and it has begun piloting fuel-cell powered delivery trucks in China and around Albany. When the credit expired, Mr. Marsh said, the price of buying one of the company's fuel cells immediately jumped 30 percent for customers. Some of those customers, he added, have budgets set aside for alternative energy spending — and in those cases, solar and wind projects, which still were backed by credits, were suddenly more attractive. The recent tax law compounded the problem, because it made it more expensive for Plug Power to get financing. When the law was signed in December, Mr. Marsh said one of his lenders called and told him his borrowing costs were going up. ""We just want a level playing field,"" Mr. Marsh said on Wednesday. He occasionally checked his phone for updates from his lobbying team in Washington. He loves the Albany region and hopes to expand here, he said, but he noted that China and Germany loomed as attractive markets, and said the company would more aggressively explore expansion there — and perhaps resource relocation — if the tax credit did not return. ""We have a business plan if it goes one way, and a business plan if it goes the other way, and we'll execute what makes sense,"" Mr. Marsh said. ""I don't get paid to be nervous."" In Washington, the lobbying team had little ability left to sway the outcome. Trade groups representing Plug Power and other energy companies had pressed for two years to extend the credit, as had the lobbyists on contract for the company. They had lined up powerful allies for the measure, including Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, the minority leader. The lobbyists spent Wednesday mostly trying to scare up news from the closed-door negotiations in the Capitol to see if their work had paid off. At midday, Mr. Marsh was told that the fuel cell credit was not yet in the bill, but discussions were ongoing. Around that time, executives decided to send Plug Power workers home to escape the snow. Word finally arrived from Washington later that day about the deal: The credit was in the budget deal, retroactive to 2017 and phased down through 2022. The industry had gotten exactly what it wanted — at least for now. Mr. Marsh, in an email, said that he was excited and thankful: ""It is time for our sales team to let our customers know that our products are now available with the tax credit, and go push sales and growth in the U.S."" Many conservative groups protested the inclusion. Several groups in the powerful Koch network sent a letter to congressional leaders, saying the budget deal had ""opened the floodgates to massive increases in government spending and corporate welfare for powerful and well-connected special interests."" Some of those interests fared better than others: Most of the 48 ""tax extenders"" tucked into the budget deal — including special tax treatment for race horse owners and timber companies — were one-year extensions retroactive for 2017 only. Congress will presumably take them up again in future negotiations. The deal passed the Senate and House early on Friday morning, after a brief but contentious debate. Mr. Marsh was off to Argentina for vacation, but he reported that the roads had been cleared around Albany, and the factory floor was humming again."

0,2018-02-14," When Sam's Club announced last month that it was closing 63 stores as part of its strategy to overhaul its business, many shoppers were outraged over the loss of jobs and memorable shopping venues. On Wednesday, the warehouse club, which is a unit of Walmart, revealed more details about its strategic shift — one that is based, predictably, on increasing its e-commerce sales. Shoppers who pay $100 a year for a Plus membership will have free shipping on almost any item, Sam's Club said. The perk is the company's attempt to catch up with Amazon's wildly successful Prime service, which also offers free shipping for about the same annual fee. The company also said it was converting a former Sam's Club store in Memphis into a fulfillment center for online orders, and planned to open other e-commerce facilities in Florida, California, the Chicago area and the Northeast in the coming months. The changes are part of a broader strategy that Sam's Club executives said involved closing underperforming stores and focusing on core customers — typically a family making $125,000 a year that lives in the suburbs and may own a small business. The company is also reducing its membership levels from three to two: the Plus membership and the $45 Club membership, which includes discounts on services like flat tire repairs. Sam's Club executives said in a call with reporters that it was still too early to say how many of the thousands of workers who had been displaced by store closings would find new jobs at the company. Last month, social media erupted when shoppers showed up at Sam's Clubs around the country that had been closed without warning. On the same day, Walmart announced that it was raising starting wages and handing out bonuses. The timing of the announcements prompted criticism that the retailer was trying to distract from the bad news at its Sam's Club operation; the company said they were unrelated."
1,2018-02-14," The streaming giant Netflix has won yet another battle against old Hollywood. On Tuesday night, Netflix announced that it had poached the hit-making producer Ryan Murphy from 21st Century Fox. The five-year deal is worth as much as $300 million, according to two people with knowledge of the deal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations. That would be one of the biggest deals ever made for a television producer. While the agreement will come as a disappointment to the studio where Mr. Murphy has spent most of his career, it also delivers a serious blow to the Walt Disney Company, which reached a deal in December to acquire most of 21st Century Fox for $52.4 billion. Mr. Murphy's contract with Fox expires in the summer, and he will make the move to Netflix in July. The prolific producer behind ""Glee,"" ""Nip/Tuck"" and the anthology series ""American Crime Story"" and ""American Horror Story,"" Mr. Murphy would have been a key piece in the expanded Disney empire, and Fox executives made several attempts to keep him in the corporate family. Amazon also courted him seriously, which played a role in driving up the price for the 52-year-old writer, director and producer from Indianapolis. ""The history of this moment is not lost on me,"" Mr. Murphy said in a statement. ""I am a gay kid from Indiana who moved to Hollywood in 1989 with $55 in savings in my pocket, so the fact that my dreams have crystallized and come true in such a major way is emotional and overwhelming to me."" Paving the way for Mr. Murphy to make the jump to streaming was the $100 million deal Netflix reached in August with the producer Shonda Rhimes, the creator of the ABC series ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Scandal."" Ms. Rhimes had been with Disney's ABC network for a decade and made the move days after Disney announced that it would expand its streaming offerings and eventually pull many of its products from Netflix. The moment was certainly right for someone like Mr. Murphy to find himself in the final months of a contract. The Hollywood economy is buzzing, with fast-moving digital disrupters taking on the studios that have been dependable providers of mass entertainment since the silent-movie era. Apple and Amazon have lately joined Netflix and Hulu in moving aggressively to sign heavyweight creators and entertainers, and the old-line companies are in danger of losing relevance if they do not put up a fight against their new, free-spending rivals. Netflix, which began offering original programming in 2012, has said it will spend up to $8 billion on content this year, and Apple has pledged at least $1 billion for original programming. The upshot is that proven show runners and big stars are in an enviable bargaining position. A factor in Mr. Murphy's decision to join Netflix was the uncertainty brought on by the agreement between Disney and Fox. He had close working relationships with Peter Rice, the president of 21st Century Fox; Dana Walden, the chairwoman of Fox's TV group (and the godmother to Mr. Murphy's children); and John Landgraf, the chief executive of the FX network, a cable channel under the Fox banner. If the Disney-Fox deal wins governmental approval, as expected, it is not a sure thing that those executives will stay in their roles. Mr. Rice said at the Code Media conference on Tuesday that he didn't know whether he would remain with the company after the planned merger went through. Making things even more muddled: Reports on Monday had it that Comcast was revisiting its bid for portions of 21st Century Fox. Easing Mr. Murphy's transition to streaming is the fact that he already had a working relationship with Netflix. Fox allowed him to sign a deal with the streaming service in September for a two-season order of a series centered on Nurse Ratched, the villain from the Ken Kesey novel ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" which was made into an Oscar-winning movie. Last week, the streaming company signed up yet another project from Mr. Murphy that may star Barbra Streisand and Gwyneth Paltrow. Both projects come from Fox's television studio. The exclusive, five-year deal for the high-profile producer is yet another coup for Netflix. In addition to signing Ms. Rhimes last summer, the company has brought aboard Dave Chappelle, David Letterman, Chris Rock and Adam Sandler with lucrative deals. Mr. Murphy did not have his hands tied at Fox, which allowed him to push boundaries. And he did not lack for respect: The first season of the FX anthology series ""American Crime Story: The People vs. O. J. Simpson,"" for which Mr. Murphy served as an executive producer, was a huge hit with critics and won nine Emmys. The Netflix deal, though, will allow him potentially bigger budgets and gives him the latitude to try movies, television or even documentaries. In his statement on Tuesday evening, Mr. Murphy expressed his gratitude toward Netflix's chief executive officer, Reed Hastings; its chief content officer, Ted Sarandos; and its vice president for original content, Cindy Holland. ""I am awash in genuine appreciation for Ted Sarandos, Reed Hastings and Cindy Holland at Netflix for believing in me and the future of my company, which will continue to champion women, minorities and L.G.B.T.Q. heroes and heroines,"" he said, ""and I am honored and grateful to continue my partnership with my friends and peers at Fox on my existing shows."" In his own statement, Mr. Sarandos said, ""Ryan Murphy's series have influenced the global cultural zeitgeist, reinvented genres and changed the course of television history. His unfaltering dedication to excellence and to give voice to the underrepresented, to showcase a unique perspective or just to shock the hell out of us, permeates his genre-shattering work."" Mr. Murphy's vast slate at Fox will not disappear overnight. All future seasons of ""American Crime Story,"" ""American Horror Story"" and ""Feud"" will continue to air on FX. His procedural drama, ""9-1-1,"" which is only six weeks old and is becoming something of a sleeper hit, will continue on Fox. And his new drama about the 1980s New York vogue scene, ""Pose,"" with a largely transgender cast, will proceed at FX. Mr. Murphy began his career as a journalist before moving into television script writing. His first show, ""Popular,"" on the WB, didn't last long but has become the source of cult fascination. ""Nip/Tuck,"" one of the earliest successes for FX, gave Mr. Murphy his first hit and transformed FX from a crusty basic cable outpost into a premier entertainment destination. In 2009, when Mr. Murphy brought some Broadway pizazz — along with an affection for misfit adolescents — to Fox's prime-time lineup with ""Glee,"" he entered the top ranks of show runners. Throughout his career, he has shown a penchant for taking the stuff of camp and making it popular. No one expected an eight-hour limited series about the rivalry between Joan Crawford and Bette Davis — ""Feud,"" on FX — to be a hit, but it was. Mr. Murphy signaled his restlessness last month, at the Television Critics Association media event in Los Angeles, when he expressed angst over his future. For years, he said, he thought he would ""literally be buried on the Fox lot."" Once Rupert Murdoch made the decision to sell the company, however, Mr. Murphy was not so sure. He approached Disney's chief executive, Robert A. Iger, with a question that suggested his discomfort with his new corporate trappings: ""Am I going to have to put Mickey Mouse in 'American Horror Story'?"""
2,2018-02-14," The remote rain forests in Peru's northeast corner are vast — so vast that the clouds that form above them can influence rainfall in the western United States. The region contains species, especially unusual fish, that are unlike any found elsewhere on Earth. Scientists studying the area's fauna and flora may gain insights into evolutionary processes and into the ecological health and geological history of the Amazon. Now the area has become home to one of the Western Hemisphere's newest national parks. Yaguas National Park will protect millions of acres of roadless wilderness — and the indigenous people who rely on it — from development and deforestation. ""This is a place where the forest stretches to the horizon,"" said Corine Vriesendorp, a conservation ecologist at The Field Museum in Chicago, one of many organizations that worked to win the national park designation, Peru's highest level of protection. ""This is one of the last great intact forests on the globe."" The designation stands in contrast to moves in the United States that may weaken protections for wilderness. President Trump has made a priority of scaling back national monuments like Bears Ears in Utah, and many advisers to the National Park System recently quit, citing concerns about the administration's commitment to environmental protections. Peru's new park, on the other hand, joins a network of parks and reserves recently created to preserve territory in South American countries, including Ecuador, Chile and Colombia. ""Nowadays we're trying to think big,"" said Avecita Chicchón, who leads the Andes-Amazon Initiative, part of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. ""You need these large areas to be connected."" In Peru and elsewhere, political leaders, bolstered by strong civil society initiatives, are recognizing the current effects of climate change and their role in mitigating them in the future. They are setting aside large parcels of land in part to fulfill commitments made as part of the Paris climate agreement. And local and indigenous groups, finally getting a legal say in the process, have also provided critical support. More than 1,000 people, belonging to at least six indigenous groups, live along a 125-mile stretch of the Yaguas and Putumayo rivers. To them, this place is ""sachamama,"" a Quechua word roughly meaning ""mother jungle,"" the sacred heart of the area that produces the flora and fauna on which the groups depend. These indigenous people are part of a larger community dispersed across the landscape during the rubber boom at the turn of 20th century. They are the descendants of the few who survived slavery, torture and genocide, which took tens of thousands of lives. Over the past two decades, indigenous federations living around Yaguas have been working to protect the land. They educated scientists and conservationists about its geography and biology, and convinced the government that the land was worth saving. In the Amazonian lowlands of Yaguas National Park, different types of rivers that contain distinct forms of aquatic life mix during the rainy season as forests flood. This unusual cocktail of river waters produces biodiversity; more than 300 species of fish have adapted to forest life. ""Imagine you were a fish and you were in a river, and you could pass to another river, not flowing, not swimming down river, instead crossing the forest,"" said Max Hidalgo, an ichthyologist at the Museo de Historia Natural in Lima. The fish feed on fruits, disperse seeds and find homes in branches. To find them, you'd have better luck cracking open a log than using a fishing line, said Dr. Hidalgo, who has been studying fish in the area for years. One species, not yet named, grows no bigger than your thumb and has only been found dwelling in subterranean tunnels. Dr. Hidalgo hopes to return to the park soon to confirm whether it's new to science. But with some 3,000 plant, 600 bird and more than 150 mammal species, there are far more than fish in Yaguas. Often elusive in heavily hunted areas, tapirs in Yaguas seem to remain more visible. ""I've never seen this many tapirs in one place,"" said Dr. Vriesendorp. They are sometimes found in the forest, eating salty mud to extract its minerals. Endangered giant otters, which can grow six feet long, have also been reported in the park. As their habitats become fragmented by deforestation and development, these oversized weasels face local extinctions. But their presence in Yaguas suggests that the aquatic ecosystem is still healthy, which is important given that the park contains the headwaters of a tributary to the Amazon. A team led by the Frankfurt Zoological Society is hoping to get an estimate of the otter population, determine if there are any otter-human conflicts, and eventually assess whether mercury from small, illegal gold mining operations has entered the food chain. If future proposals are successful, three-quarters of the Putumayo River will become a vast, unfragmented corridor for wildlife across northern Peru. And it could also be important as the world aims to reduce carbon emissions. Looking over the rain forest from above, predictable linear patterns of another Yaguas jewel emerge: peat bogs, only recently discovered. They are part of a network of peat bogs across northern Peru that together store massive amounts of carbon. Keeping the carbon in the ground is critical, although it will prove challenging in remote Yaguas and surrounding areas with fewer restrictions. ""For now, Yaguas is safe, but in the 20 years I've been working in the Amazon, I've learned the hard way that today's remoteness is tomorrow's access,"" said Gregory Asner, an ecologist at the Carnegie Institution for Science. But for now, many are celebrating. ""People don't create national parks every day,"" said Dr. Vriesendorp. ""It really is a big deal."" _____ Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter."
0,2018-02-15," NBC is turning to its own bench to replace Jennifer Salke, who announced last week that she was leaving the network to run Amazon Studios. The network said on Thursday that Lisa Katz and Tracey Pakosta will become the co-presidents of scripted programming, and both will report to the NBC Entertainment chairman, Robert Greenblatt. Ms. Katz has been running NBC's drama department for the past year and a half. Before coming to NBC, Ms. Katz worked at Fox, where she helped develop ""This Is Us"" (Fox's TV studio is the production house behind the current NBC hit) and ""Empire."" Those are the two biggest dramas in broadcast television in the last three years. Ms. Pakosta has been running the NBC comedy department since 2015. Ms. Pakosta, who had previously been working at NBC's corporate cousin, Universal Television, helped develop NBC's two biggest comedies at the moment, ""The Good Place"" and ""Superstore.' The two new executives join Paul Telegdy, the network's reality television chief, in NBC's entertainment leadership structure. Mr. Telegdy and Ms. Salke were Mr. Greenblatt's key lieutenants in leading NBC's surprising turnaround from a moribund network to No. 1 in the ratings."
1,2018-02-15," Jeffrey Tambor is officially no longer part of the ""Transparent"" cast. Amazon Studios' decision to move on without Mr. Tambor, the Emmy-winning star of one of its most highly regarded series, followed months of speculation about whether he would return to the show after he was accused of sexual harassment last fall. Mr. Tambor, 73, was accused of inappropriate workplace behavior by a fellow ""Transparent"" cast member, Trace Lysette, and a former personal assistant, Van Barnes. In November, Mr. Tambor said that he did not see how he could return to the series, citing what he described as the ""politicized atmosphere"" on the set after he had been publicly accused. ""This is no longer the job I signed up for,"" he said at the time. The next month, however, Mr. Tambor told The New York Times through his publicist that ""no final decision for next year has been made, either by Jeffrey or by Amazon."" On Thursday, Amazon Studios and the creator of ""Transparent"" made it clear that he would not be back. ""I have great respect and admiration for Van Barnes and Trace Lysette, whose courage in speaking out about their experience on 'Transparent' is an example of the leadership this moment in our culture requires,"" said the series' creator, Jill Soloway. ""We are grateful to the many trans people who have supported our vision for 'Transparent' since its inception and remain heartbroken about the pain and mistrust their experience has generated in our community."" An email seeking comment from representatives of Mr. Tambor was not immediately returned. How ""Transparent"" proceeds for its fifth season without its star — an actor who won two Emmys in the role of Maura Pfefferman (formerly Mort Pfefferman) — is an open question that another popular web series has already had to answer. The production team for ""House of Cards"" fired its star, Kevin Spacey, after he was accused of inappropriate sexual behavior, and Netflix will turn to Robin Wright to carry its final, shortened season. Ms. Wright will get an assist when Diane Lane and Greg Kinnear join the cast. The drama over ""Transparent"" has come at a moment when Amazon is effectively hitting the reset button on its programming. Its head of entertainment, Roy Price, was let go after a sexual harassment allegation in October and was replaced last week by the NBC executive Jennifer Salke. The streaming service is also contending with big-spending rivals in Apple, which is hurriedly buying up new projects, and Netflix, which signed the producer Ryan Murphy to a $300 million deal this week. Mr. Tambor is a veteran actor whose early work included appearances on ""Kojak,"" ""Starsky and Hutch"" and ""Taxi"" in the 1970s. He later played a recurring character on ""Hill Street Blues"" and went on to be a staple of the critically acclaimed series ""The Larry Sanders Show"" and ""Arrested Development."""
2,2018-02-15," The battle between the Hollywood establishment and the streaming-media giants has caused big changes in the entertainment industry in recent months, driving up the prices of major stars and series producers while leaving traditional companies in danger of losing relevance. The effect of the digital disrupters on the Hollywood economy had its big reveal in August when Netflix announced a multiyear agreement worth an estimated $100 million with the producer Shonda Rhimes, who had made her name at Disney's ABC with ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Scandal."" In November, Apple — a new entrant in the streaming wars — beat out Showtime and Netflix for a series starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston as morning talk show hosts. The cost? An estimated $240 million for 20 episodes. That same month, Amazon Studios entered the mass-market arena in dramatic fashion by pledging to spend some $200 million on a series based on ""The Lord of the Rings."" Previously, it had been following a please-the-critics strategy heavy on midbudget fare from directors like Todd Haynes, Richard Linklater and Jill Soloway. In this overheated atmosphere, Ryan Murphy, the 52-year-old producer behind critical and commercial hits like ""Glee"" and ""American Crime Story,"" found himself in the final months of his contract with 21st Century Fox, his longtime corporate home. He took full advantage of the shifting Hollywood economy on Tuesday, agreeing to leave Fox for Netflix and its offer of a five-year deal valued at roughly $300 million. Mr. Murphy was in an ideal bargaining position not only because he possesses a fecund imagination able to spin out one successful series after another, but because Apple and Amazon have lately proved themselves willing to spend their way into rivalries with the old-line movie studios and television networks. Ted Sarandos, the chief content officer at Netflix, laid down the gauntlet five years ago when he said, ""The goal is to become HBO faster than HBO can become us."" That statement seemed unlikely, coming from an executive who had only recently begun overseeing original programming at a company better known for tucking DVDs into postage-paid red envelopes. Jump-cut to the present: Netflix is valued at some $115 billion and has 110.6 million subscribers worldwide. It has shown off its might by signing David Letterman to a deal at reportedly $2 million an episode for his new talk show series, giving Chris Rock a reported $40 million for two standup specials and handing Jerry Seinfeld a reported $100 million for his interview program, ""Comedians in Cars Drinking Coffee,"" and standup shows. Dana Walden, a co-chief executive of the Fox television group, said Mr. Sarandos's signing of Ms. Rhimes was the deal that had evinced a deep change in Hollywood. ""What Ted did was extremely disruptive and sent a message to the entire talent community: These old deals that seemed incredibly lucrative at the time, there's a new template in town,"" Ms. Walden said. ""For any uber-premium creator, the value has gone up 10 times. And Ryan is a once-in-a-lifetime creator."" Rick Rosen, the head of TV at the agency WME, said it had become clear that Netflix was now able to outspend the companies that had been around since the early days of the movie business. ""As a representative of talent, if you have top-top talent, you must talk to them,"" he said. ""You'd be negligent if you didn't. Top talent wants to pitch to Netflix."" Another competitor in the expanding streaming industry, Hulu — which is available only in the United States — has gained momentum recently with original series like the much-decorated ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" and now has 17 million subscribers. While that is no match for Netflix, the company has seen growth in each of the last two quarters. Apple is the wild card. The company has been buying projects at breakneck speed as it begins to shell out more than $1 billion on original programming. And as Amazon moves into the internationally friendly fantasy genre with ""The Lord of the Rings,"" it has equipped itself with fresh leadership in the person of the respected NBC executive Jennifer Salke. (Earlier this month, she replaced Roy Price, who resigned as the head of Amazon Studios in October after he was accused of sexual harassment.) With the old Hollywood model disrupted, or perhaps broken, Disney, Fox, CBS, Viacom and Time Warner have moved to gain scale in their efforts to compete against the deep-pocketed upstarts. Pending governmental approval, Disney will acquire much of 21st Century Fox in a $52.4 billion deal that the two companies reached in December. CBS and Viacom, which were part of the same corporation from 2000 to 2006, are in talks to reunite. And AT&T is working to purchase Time Warner — a deal that is in jeopardy because of a lawsuit filed by the Justice Department to block it on antitrust grounds. The mergers and acquisitions taking place in the background are, for now, a destabilizing force in the entertainment industry — one that likely contributed to Mr. Murphy's decision to leave old Hollywood for the streaming space. ""Were the Disney deal to have never happened, I think he would have been close to a new deal with us,"" said Ms. Walden, the Fox executive who has worked closely with Mr. Murphy. ""If the Disney move happened a year ago, and the transaction was completed by now and we were part of the Disney Company, I think he would be part of us."" Mr. Murphy declined to comment for this article. Disney — a part-owner of Hulu that is building new streaming services under its chief executive, Robert A. Iger — has repeatedly cited 21st Century Fox's ability to create popular programming as one of the main reasons it sought to acquire it from Rupert Murdoch. Disney's own television studio has not been a reliable supplier. The day after losing Mr. Murphy to Netflix, John Landgraf, the chief executive of FX, which is part of 21st Century Fox, pointed to his cable network's long record of producing talent, including Donald Glover (""Atlanta"") and Pamela Adlon (""Better Things""). ""With more than 20 scripted original series on our schedule or upcoming, FX has a very successful track record of identifying and developing talented writers who have produced award-winning hit shows, and it will continue to do so,"" he said. The money aside, Mr. Murphy may have decided that he had a better chance of creating new shows with minimal interference from above at Netflix, rather than at a Disneyfied version of 21st Century Fox. Referring to Disney's agreement to acquire much of the company at a news media event last month, the producer said: ""When this deal first went down, I got a call from the Murdochs and I got a call from Mr. Iger. And I said point-blank, you know, the stuff that I do is not specifically Disney, and I'm interested in that and I'm concerned about that."" The Murphy deal is a distillation of what may prove to be a once-in-a-generation Hollywood moment. He was looking for security at a time when the old-line companies had yet to take the expanded form they are likely to assume in the next year — and when the streaming services are spending in manic style. And it helps that Mr. Murphy has become a Netflix obsessive in his own right. ""All Ryan has watched for the last year has been Netflix,"" said Ms. Walden, who is the godmother to Mr. Murphy's children. ""He loves their Y.A. series, he loves their documentaries, he watched 'The OA' and loved it, he loved '13 Reasons Why,' he admires the brand, the programming. It was the right timing and right company for him."" The question now is: How long will the streaming companies continue to spend in a George Streinbrenner-like fashion for talent? Last month, Netflix told investors that it had generated a net income of more than $559 million in 2017, but said its free cash flow was negative $2 billion — a figure that could balloon to $4 billion this year, the company said."

0,2018-02-18," At a moment when living composers — especially women — struggle to get their works performed, few would have predicted that a half-hour TV show would emerge as a key showcase for their work. But ""Mozart in the Jungle,"" the daffy Amazon comedy whose fourth season began streaming on Friday, has become an unlikely destination to hear new music. Here is a taste of some of the recent pieces featured on the show, which is set in a fanciful version of the New York classical music world and stars Gael García Bernal, Bernadette Peters, Malcolm McDowell and Lola Kirke. The works were performed on Tuesday at National Sawdust, the striking performance space in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which itself has a cameo in the season. Caroline Shaw, a composer, violinist and singer, won the Pulitzer Prize in 2013, when she was 30 — and has gone on to have her work performed by some of classical music's major artists and collaborate with Kanye West. She appears as herself in the fourth season of ""Mozart"": Ms. Kirke's character, who leads an ensemble devoted to works by women, serenades Ms. Shaw outside her apartment and gets permission to premiere this piece, ""Hi,"" in a conducting competition. (Ms. Shaw conducts it here.) The composer Missy Mazzoli won wide acclaim for her opera ""Breaking the Waves,"" based on the dark psychosexual film by Lars von Trier, and just premiered a new opera, ""Proving Up,"" at the Kennedy Center in Washington. She composed this piece, ""Impromptu,"" for the show's third season, where it was presented as a work by Mr. McDowell's character, the aging but rebellious maestro Thomas Pembridge. Nico Muhly, whose Hitchcockian opera ""Marnie"" will be performed at the Metropolitan Opera next season, wrote a made-for-TV aria for the third season of ""Mozart,"" in which he also had a cameo. On the show, Mr. García Bernal's character, a conductor, flies to Venice to lead a diva's comeback concert. He persuades the singer to try something new: a Muhly aria based on the ""Long Island Lolita"" tabloid case in which a teenager named Amy Fisher shot the wife of her lover, Joey Buttafuoco. It is sung here by the soprano Susanna Phillips, currently appearing in ""La Bohème"" at the Met.  Paola Prestini co-founded her first production company, VisionIntoArt, while still a student at the Juilliard School, and went on to become the artistic director of National Sawdust. She is currently collaborating with Robert Wilson on an opera-theater work based on Hemingway's ""The Old Man and the Sea."" This is an excerpt from her piece ""Listen, Quiet,"" which is performed in season four of ""Mozart"" at a chaotic party in which Mr. García Bernal's character, distraught, gives away his possessions. (The cellist here, Jeffrey Zeigler, who used to play with the Kronos Quartet — and is married to Ms. Prestini — is part of an ensemble's worth of musicians with cameos in the party scene.)"

1,2018-02-20," Walmart has been making big investments in its online business as it tries to adapt to the shifting preferences of global shoppers and to keep pace with its rival Amazon. But Walmart's online sales growth hit a speed bump in the company's fiscal fourth quarter, which included the critical holiday shopping season. Online sales grew 23 percent in the United States during that three-month period, the company reported on Tuesday, less than half the rate of growth in each of the previous three quarters. Walmart's chief executive, Doug McMillon, said ""operational challenges"" at the company's fulfillment centers during the holidays were responsible for some of the slowdown. Walmart said that a large influx of electronics, toys and other seasonal items had made it difficult to fulfill sales of everyday products. The slowdown reflects a broader challenge at Walmart, which has dominated the retail industry for decades with its extensive store network but is now playing catch-up in the e-commerce realm with Amazon, which captures half of all online spending. ""We are building a business,"" Mr. McMillon said on a call with analysts on Tuesday. ""We are learning something new."" Despite the slower pace of online growth, Walmart's total sales increased 4.1 percent, to $136.3 billion, during the quarter, which ended Jan. 31. That was not enough to impress Wall Street. Walmart shares dropped nearly 9 percent in early morning trading. On a per-share basis, Walmart earned $1.33 in the fourth quarter, short of the $1.37 that analysts had expected. Operating income fell 28 percent, to $4.5 billion. Walmart has expanded its e-commerce offerings by purchasing Jet.com and the online clothing retailers Bonobos and Modcloth. Analysts have nonetheless questioned how Walmart plans to integrate the acquisitions into a cohesive online retail strategy. On Tuesday, the company said it would focus its broad push for new customers on Walmart.com and not Jet, a less-recognizable brand tailored to more urban, higher-income customers. Walmart spent $3.3 billion to acquire Jet in 2016. At the time, it was the largest deal ever for an e-commerce company, although it was not clear how the two brands would mesh. ""Jet will go through adjustment, but it will grow again,"" Mr. McMillon said on Tuesday. Walmart's lagging growth online was not entirely unexpected given that the Jet acquisition was responsible for the large growth rates of previous quarters. But Mr. McMillon acknowledged that the fourth-quarter slowdown ""was a bit more than we planned."" To increase growth again — Walmart said it expected online sales to rise 40 percent over the next year — the company is accelerating its web-based grocery business, increasing the number of stores where customers can order food online and pick it up in stores. Walmart is also experimenting with home delivery in the United States and in Asia, where it recently signed a partnership with the Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten to deliver groceries. Still, finding ways to integrate Walmart's stores with its e-commerce strategy is costly. Last week, Walmart announced that it would offer members of its Sam's Club unit free shipping of online orders for an annual fee of $100. As part of that effort, Walmart said it would convert a Sam's Club store in Memphis into an e-commerce distribution center and planned to open more such centers elsewhere in the United States in the coming year. The company closed a total of 63 Sam's Club stores during the fourth quarter, affecting more than 9,000 workers. Walmart said that it would try to find new positions for as many of the employees as possible, but that some would probably end up out of work. The restructuring at Sam's Club was among the factors that drove profits down for the quarter. Even without the restructuring and other one-time charges, the company said, operating income would have fallen for the quarter."
2,2018-02-20," The supermarket operator Albertsons said Tuesday morning that it would buy the remnants of the Rite Aid drugstore chain. By the end of the day, Walmart saw its stock drop by more than 10 percent on weak profit. Both can blame Amazon. An old-line grocer, Albertsons is striving for reinvigoration in a retail landscape being upended by e-commerce competitors and discount food stores. But it can be difficult for any company, no matter how strategic its deal-making, to pull off a revival in this environment. The retail stalwart, Walmart has been trying to build its online presence as it moves to fend off Amazon. But even deep pockets don't guarantee success in an increasingly digital landscape. Amazon is the omnipresent foe, in whatever realm that Albertsons or Walmart plays in. The e-commerce giant wants to dominate the grocery store business, while also eyeing the health care industry. ""It's the battle of the old generation versus the new generation,"" said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm. ""And right now the companies that are gaining share is the new generation."" The deal for Rite Aid puts Albertsons directly in the middle of two major pushes by Amazon. Albertsons plans to rebrand its in-house pharmacies under the Rite Aid name, and to continue operating some stand-alone Rite Aid stores. The bet is that the increased foot traffic to the in-house pharmacies will bring more customers to Albertsons' food aisles, where they will pick up a rib-eye steak or a bunch of bananas on their way out. Last year, Amazon moved aggressively to extend its e-commerce edge to groceries, acquiring Whole Foods for $13.4 billion in a deal that greatly enhanced its ability to deliver fresh food to millions of American households. Amazon's entry into the grocery business could hurt Albertsons and similar chains whose greatest asset may be the convenient locations of their stores. If Amazon increases its home delivery of fresh food, that convenience may not be as appealing. Conventional grocers like Albertsons are also feeling pressure from chains like Trader Joe's, which is known for its affordable high-quality products, and Wegmans, a growing regional chain that has built a cultlike following. ""Grocery is being hit by multiple factors,"" said Gerald Storch, the former chief executive of the retailer Hudson's Bay. The pharmacy business, too, is undergoing major changes, with the nation's largest operators of drugstores pursuing mergers to control costs and increase profits. In December, the drugstore giant CVS Health said it would merge with the health insurer Aetna in a $69 billion deal that could reshape the way health care is delivered in the United States. That deal came together after a federal judge blocked Aetna's proposed merger with rival Humana last year. Rite Aid had previously sought to bulk up by merging with Walgreens. Negotiations between two of the biggest drugstore chains in the United States ended after antitrust authorities indicated they were unlikely to approve the combination. Instead, Rite Aid agreed last year to sell 1,932 stores and three distribution centers to Walgreens for $4.38 billion. Amazon's specter also looms over the health care field. The company recently teamed up with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase to form an independent health care company to serve the three firms' employees and potentially revamp the broader industry. For Albertsons, the Rite Aid deal is just the latest step to draw in more customers. In November, the company reached an agreement with Instacart to provide on-demand grocery-delivery services. It also invested last year in El Rancho Supermercado, a Texas-based retailer focused on stores for Latino customers. Originally founded by Joe Albertson in Boise, Idaho, in 1939, Albertsons grew primarily across the West. In 2013, it was acquired by a group of investors led by the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management for about $3 billion. Its biggest deal came in 2014 when Cerberus agreed to buy Safeway, another grocery chain whose roots lie in Idaho, for $9.2 billion. A planned public offering of the company's stock in 2015 never took place. The Rite Aid deal provides Albertsons' investors with a way of finally going public after investing billions of dollars. Under the deal's terms, Rite Aid shareholders would get $1.83 in cash and one share of Albertsons stock, or 1.079 shares of Albertsons stock, for every 10 shares of Rite Aid they owned. Walmart's biggest challenges are tied to its own plans to compete with Amazon. Walmart spent heavily acquiring online retailers like Bonobos, Jet.com and ModCloth. Investors have largely been willing to forgive the company's softening profits as long as the investments resulted in increased sales. But Wall Street is getting impatient. In announcing the fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, Walmart said its online sales had grown 23 percent in the United States during the three-month period that ended Jan. 31. That was less than half the rate of growth in each of the previous three quarters. ""Walmart got a late start to the internet game, and they are still suffering for it,"" said Mr. Johnson, of Customer Growth Partners."
0,2018-02-21," My wife and I were just settling into bed one night when Alexa, the other woman in my life, decided to make herself heard. Without being summoned, the Amazon Echo Dot at my bedside — one of the half-dozen devices that Alexa inhabits in our house — lit up its spectral blue ring, as if it had heard its triggering wake word, ""Alexa."" But instead of offering help with some household chore, the voice assistant began to wail, like a child screaming in a horror-movie dream. ""Huh,"" I said to my wife when it was over. She said something less kind. But here's what's really strange: By the next morning, we had forgotten all about it. It is a measure of how thoroughly Amazon's voice assistant has wormed herself into our lives, and into much of the culture beyond, that I never considered unplugging her after the scream. Instead I chalked the incident up to a harmless bug — one of the many mysteries of living with an artificial intelligence life form that can be summoned at a breath. (An Amazon representative offered to investigate, but said the company had never heard of such a thing happening before and didn't think Alexa was even capable of making such a sound.) When Amazon unveiled Alexa three and a half years ago, it was roundly jeered. Now, against all expectations, even though she's sometimes unpredictable and unpolished, Alexa is here to stay. And that may be underplaying it; people in tech have recently begun to talk about Alexa as being more than just part of a hit gadget. Something bigger is afoot. Alexa has the best shot of becoming the third great consumer computing platform of this decade — next to iOS and Android, a computing service so ubiquitous that it sets a foundation for much of the rest of what happens in tech. It is not a sure path. Amazon could screw this up, and rivals like Google have many cards to play to curb Alexa's rise. Amazon's strategy — something like a mix between Google's plan for Android and Apple's for the iPhone — is also unusual. And there are lingering social concerns about voice assistants and, as I discovered, their sometimes creepy possibilities. How many people, really, are willing to let an always-on device in their house? Despite this, Alexa's ubiquity is a plausible enough future that it is worth seriously pondering. In an effort to do so, I recently dived headlong into Alexa's world. I tried just about every Alexa gadget I could get my hands on, including many not made by Amazon, such as an Alexa-enabled pickup truck, to see what life with her will be like once she's everywhere. What I found was a mess — many non-Amazon Alexa devices aren't ready for prime time — but an inviting one. Late-night shrieks notwithstanding, one day very soon, Alexa or something like it will be everywhere — and computing will be better for it. ""We had a spectacular holiday,"" Dave Limp, Amazon's senior vice president of devices and services, said when I called last month to chat about the assistant's future. Amazon is famously cagey about sales numbers, but Mr. Limp braved a slight disclosure: ""We've said we've sold tens of millions of Alexa-enabled devices, but I can assure you that last year we also sold tens of millions of just Echo devices. At that scale, it's safe to now call this a category."" Mr. Limp's distinction is confusing but important. At Amazon, Alexa lives in two places. She is part of a device category, the Echo smart speaker, which now comes in a variety of permutations, from the $49 Echo Dot to the screen-bearing Echo Show, which sells for $229. (These prices are merely guidelines; in its bid for ubiquity, Amazon often offers steep discounts, with the Dot selling for $29 during last year's holidays.) But like Google's Android operating system, Alexa is also a piece of software that Amazon makes available for free for other device makers to put into their products. At least 50 devices are now powered by Alexa, and more keep coming. They include dozens of Echo-like smart speakers, home thermostats, light fixtures, dashboard cameras, smartphones, headphones, a smoke alarm and a very strange robot. Alexa is spreading so quickly that even Amazon can't keep track of it. Mr. Limp said that as he wandered the floor at the CES electronics trade show in Las Vegas this year, even he was surprised by the number of different Alexa devices. ""To me, that says the strategy is working,"" he said. There are some costs to this strategy, which prizes speed over polish. The universe of Alexa-enabled products is shaggy. Many third-party devices get low reviews on Amazon. Many don't include some of Alexa's key functions — I tested devices that don't let you set reminders, one of the main reasons to use Alexa. Technical limitations also prevent non-Amazon devices from taking advantage of some of Alexa's best new features, like the ability to call phones or other Alexas (creating a kind of home intercom system). Mr. Limp said Amazon was aiming to fix these limitations, but conceded that its strategy necessarily led to some low-end devices. ""You're right, sometimes the ramifications of this will be that some devices will be out there that aren't perfect,"" he said. But there are also advantages to Alexa's model for ubiquity. Imagine if you could gain access to your smartphone on just about any screen you encountered. Move from your phone to your TV to your laptop to your car, and wherever you went, you'd find all your apps, contacts and data just there, accessible through the same interface. That model isn't really possible for phones. But because Alexa runs in the cloud, it allows for a wondrously device-agnostic experience. Alexa on my Echo is the same as Alexa on my TV is the same as Alexa on my Sonos speaker. And it's the same even on devices not in your home. Ford — the first of several carmakers to offer Alexa integration in its vehicles — lent me an F-150 pickup outfitted with Alexa. The experience was joyously boring: I called up Alexa while barreling down the highway, and although she was slower to respond than at home, she worked just the same. She knew my musical tastes, my shopping list, the apps and smart-home services I had installed, and just about everything else. It was the best showcase of the possibilities of always-on voice computing. In the future, wherever you go, you can expect to talk to a computer that knows you, one that can get stuff done for you without any hassle. There's a lot of money in the voice game. For Amazon, Alexa's rise could lead to billions of dollars in additional sales to its store, Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, predicted recently. Amazon is thus not the only company chasing the dream of everywhere voice computing. Google, which is alive to the worry that Alexa will outpace it in the assistant game, is also offering its Google Assistant to other device makers. Though Amazon remains the leader in the business, there's some evidence that Google's devices gained market share over the holidays. (Apple, which just released a $349 smart speaker, HomePod, does not seem to be aiming for voice ubiquity.) The emerging platform war between Amazon and Google could lead to fallout for users. But their platforms can also play together. Amazon's and Google's relationships with third-party companies are nonexclusive, which means that hardware makers are free to add both Alexa and Google Assistant to their products. Sonos, for instance, now integrates with Alexa, and is planning to add Google Assistant soon. This is not the best outcome for the future; it would be better for all of us if the next computing platform didn't come from one of the current tech giants, and if start-ups didn't have to rely on Amazon or Google for this key piece of tech. But that seems unlikely. If Alexa is headed for ubiquity, it's good that Google may be, too."
0,2018-02-25," Lawrence Wright was reluctant to adapt ""The Looming Tower,"" his Pulitzer Prize-winning history of Al Qaeda and the run-up to 9/11. But it wasn't lost on him that the number of deals for scripted series was rapidly increasing each year — a development that went along with the sudden rise of the streaming industry. ""It became clear to me something's going to be done, whether it's my book or some other entity using the book without actually acknowledging it,"" Mr. Wright said. ""I decided I better take control of this."" Once he became serious about the project, he did not imagine it would end up at Hulu. This was in 2015, two years before Hulu won eight Emmy Awards for ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" back when it was best known as a platform where viewers could stream episodes of network television shows. Mr. Wright developed the idea with the screenwriter Dan Futterman, who had written the scripts for ""Capote"" and ""Foxcatcher,"" and the filmmaker Alex Gibney, who had directed a documentary based on Mr. Wright's 2013 book, ""Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood and the Prison of Belief."" Once they had their pitch honed, they approached HBO, Netflix and Amazon, each of which had proved able to make the kind of ambitious series they were envisioning. As a courtesy, they sent word to Hulu. Craig Erwich, the head of content at Hulu, read ""The Looming Tower"" soon after it was published in 2006. He even asked for a meeting with Mr. Wright in 2007, when he was an executive at Fox. Eight years later, he was a contender. ""I got a phone call from the reps,"" Mr. Erwich said, ""and they were like, 'Are you aware of this book ""The Looming Tower""? And I was like, 'Am I!'"" When Mr. Wright, Mr. Futterman and Mr. Gibney entered Hulu's headquarters in Santa Monica, Calif., their expectations were not high. ""It was a meeting we considered discretionary,"" said Mr. Wright, 70, who goes by Larry. The author and his two collaborators sat in a tiny conference room with Mr. Erwich and Beatrice Springborn, Hulu's head of original programming. During the meeting Mr. Erwich did not hold back his enthusiasm. ""He was like a fanboy of Larry's,"" Mr. Futterman recalled. The Hulu executives surprised the ""Looming Tower"" team by offering them the works. A straight-to-series order, with no lengthy development process? Done. A promise not to buckle under pressure from the federal agencies who may not like how the series would portray them? Done. The biggest dollar commitment? Done. The conversation left Mr. Wright and his collaborators slightly dazed. ""We walked out of that meeting and said, 'Are we really doing this? Are we really going to do Hulu?'"" Mr. Wright said. They ended up at a nearby Italian restaurant. Seated at a sidewalk table in the evening light, Mr. Wright and Mr. Gibney ordered martinis, Mr. Futterman had a Peroni, and they talked it over. ""We were like, 'Hulu? Is it growing? Is it not growing?'"" Mr. Futterman recalled. ""We talked about whether this was a mistake or not."" They eventually decided that — although Hulu did not have the prestige of HBO, the subscriber base of Netflix or the global might of Amazon — it was the right place for their project. Any remaining doubts held by Mr. Wright and his collaborators were dispelled after Hulu rolled out ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" which had its premiere last April to critical acclaim on its way to taking the awards for best drama series at the Emmys and the Golden Globes. Ten years after it began, Hulu was a player at last. ""The Looming Tower,"" a 10-episode limited series that stars Jeff Daniels and Peter Sarsgaard, makes its debut on Wednesday. Hulu will follow it up by releasing the second season of ""The Handmaid's Tale"" in April and unveiling another big production, ""Castle Rock,"" a horror anthology series from J. J. Abrams and Stephen King, in the summer. Unlike Netflix, Hulu is available only in the United States. It has 17 million subscribers, a figure dwarfed by Netflix's 52.8 million United States subscribers out of more than 100 million worldwide. Even with the awards and media attention it has received lately, Hulu is heading toward a future clouded with uncertainty, thanks to a tricky corporate structure and the merger mania that has taken hold of the media and entertainment industries. The company has four owners: The Walt Disney Company (30 percent), 21st Century Fox (30 percent), Comcast (30 percent) and Time Warner (10 percent). If Disney's pending $52.4 billion acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox wins governmental approval, as is expected, Disney will own 60 percent of Hulu. The Disney-Fox deal raises the question of what will happen to Hulu, given that Disney is already developing two streaming services. Another potential issue is whether or not two of Hulu's owners — Disney, which owns ABC, and Comcast, which owns NBC Universal — will be able to play nicely with each other after they become owners with uneven stakes in the platform. ""It's incredibly awkward,"" said Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG, a global financial services firm. ""The question is which way it goes: Does Comcast buy out Disney? Or does Disney buy out Comcast?"" The corporate uncertainties have come to Hulu at a time of mounting losses: It lost $920 million in 2017, according to BTIG, which projects that the business will lose $1.67 billion this year. Hulu is also facing more intense competition than ever as its rivals disrupt the entertainment industry by handing out big checks. In recent months, Netflix has signed the producers Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy to nine-figure deals; Amazon has pledged more than $200 million toward a ""Lord of the Rings"" series; and Apple, a newcomer in the field, is shelling out hundreds of millions to create original programming of its own. The outlook is not all bleak. According to Peter Rice, the president of 21st Century Fox, Hulu had more subscriber growth domestically than Netflix in the last two quarters of 2017. And this month, Disney signaled its commitment when its chief strategy officer, Kevin Mayer, suggested that the other streaming services now in the works at Disney would not get in Hulu's way. ""We're very much in support of growing Hulu,"" Mr. Mayer said at Recode's Code Media conference. ""It takes an investment, for sure. We're happy to undertake that investment for the outcome, which we know is going to happen. It's going to be a big, profitable service."" Hulu has tried to match its rivals in courting talent aggressively. In addition to greenlighting ""The Looming Tower"" and ""Castle Rock,"" the company made a deal with George Clooney for a six-episode adaptation of ""Catch-22""; signed Jason Blum, a producer of ""Get Out,"" for a monthly horror anthology series; brought aboard Beau Willimon, the creator of ""House of Cards,"" for a series starring Sean Penn about human colonization of Mars; and arranged for a reboot of the popular 1990s cartoon ""Animaniacs"" with Steven Spielberg and his Amblin Entertainment production company. Hulu has also built up its catalog by gaining the rights to shows like ""30 Rock,"" ""The Golden Girls"" and ""This Is Us."" Its recent purchase of the 15-season library of the NBC medical drama ""ER"" — which had not appeared on any streaming platform since it went off the air in 2009 — prompted think pieces about the show's surprising popularity in 2018. Hulu's moves extended to the executive realm last May, when it hired Joel Stillerman away from AMC, where he was head of programming, and made him its chief of content. ""Beginning last year, we said this was a time for Hulu to really grow up and be aggressive and be much more offensive in its approach, rather than being defensive,"" Randy Freer, the chief executive of Hulu, said. The company has been fighting its way to prominence ever since it began as an answer to YouTube in 2007. ""Hulu really started as, and has been for the better part of a decade, a hedge,"" Mr. Freer said. ""It started as a hedge against YouTube — they were going to dominate digital video. Then it was a hedge against Netflix — you didn't want one buyer of content."" Mr. Futterman, the screenwriter, said Hulu had won ""The Looming Tower"" partly because of its guarantee of a speedy development, which appealed to him after his recent dealings with HBO. Mr. Futterman — who was an executive producer, along with his wife, Anya Epstein, of HBO's ""In Treatment"" — said he had grown frustrated by the cable network after it tied up projects he had put together with Ms. Epstein, including a stalled adaptation of the Jennifer Egan novel ""A Visit from the Goon Squad."" ""I developed two projects with HBO with Anya after 'In Treatment,'"" Mr. Futterman said. ""That was one of among about 200 they were developing."" After noting the promises made by Hulu, he added, ""What situation would you rather be in?"" To Mr. Daniels, the Emmy-winning actor who plays the F.B.I. agent John O'Neill in ""The Looming Tower,"" Hulu is playing in the same league as its chief rivals. ""The money feels the same. The production value feels the same,"" Mr. Daniels said. ""You got all the trucks that a big movie does. Somebody's spending money on this. We're filming in, what, four or five countries? That's not cheap."""
0,2018-02-27," Amazon said Tuesday that it had acquired Ring, a maker of internet-connected doorbells and cameras, pushing more deeply into the home security market. The deal is worth around $1.1 billion, according to a person briefed on the deal who would speak only anonymously because the terms were private. Ring is best known for a doorbell with a security camera inside. The device allows homeowners to monitor visitors at their front door through an app on their phone, even if they're not at home. Amazon has made home automation a major focus because of the success of its Echo family of products, which allow users to control thermostats, surveillance cameras and other connected devices using voice commands. Amazon's Echo Spot device already works with Ring doorbells, allowing people to look at footage from the cameras on the Echo Spot's screen. Amazon had invested an undisclosed amount in Ring through its Alexa Fund, which finances start-ups that integrate their products with Alexa, the Amazon intelligent assistant that powers Echoes and other devices. Buying Ring, though, suggests that Amazon has more ambitious plans for the product than it could achieve through a partnership. Luke Schoenfelder, chief executive of Latch, a start-up that makes a family of smart locks, said he believed that Amazon would make a more serious effort to enter the home security market and compete against companies like ADT, Comcast and Alarm.com. Mr. Schoenfelder speculated that Amazon could seek to make home security part of its Prime membership service, which today includes free and fast delivery of orders and video streaming. ""You could imagine some kind of bundled offering with Ring's capabilities,"" he said. ADT's stock fell sharply after the deal became public on Tuesday afternoon. It ended the day down 4.6 percent. The companies declined to say much about their plans. ""Ring's home security products and services have delighted customers since Day 1,"" Amazon said in a statement. ""We're excited to work with this talented team and help them in their mission to keep homes safe and secure."" Ring's statement said: ""We'll be able to achieve even more by partnering with an inventive, customer-centric company like Amazon. We look forward to being a part of the Amazon team as we work toward our vision for safer neighborhoods."" Ring's internet doorbells start at $179. People who want to use them to record video must pay for that capability, with plans starting at $3 a month or $30 a year. The company also makes stand-alone security cameras. Amazon has taken some baby steps into home security. Last year it began selling an indoor security camera of its own design, Amazon Cloud Cam, and in December it acquired Blink, a maker of inexpensive internet security cameras and doorbells. A service called Amazon Key uses cameras and internet-connected door locks to allow delivery people to drop orders inside customers' homes. Google, one of Amazon's biggest rivals, is also an increasingly important player in home automation and security, with its Nest thermostats and security cameras. James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, said he believed that Amazon had bought Ring so it could add more intelligent capabilities to its doorbells and cameras, like the ability to use software to recognize faces at the front door. ""I think it's about going to the next level and having Alexa say, 'James, your fifth grader just walked in, and I locked the door behind them,'"" he said. ""It's where these technologies have to go."""
1,2018-02-27," My mother, who has dementia, has wanted to travel to Mars for some time now, and for a day or two it looked like she might be getting her chance, metaphorically speaking. Her heart was not working well, her breathing was labored, there was a call from the nursing-home doctor, who brought up the subject of hospice. This happened the same week Elon Musk was sending a red sports car with a make-believe driver into space. ""My mother no longer seems to be as crazy as she once did,"" I tell my friend Herb. ""Her insanity is converging with Elon Musk's. She and a Tesla may be blasting off at the same time."" My mother's crisis is averted by antibiotics. The next day I am at the nursing home with videos of the Falcon Heavy SpaceX launch because, like I say, space travel is Ma's thing. ""Does this Elon Musk know about me?"" Ma says, because in the Ma universe, even before the stroke and the dementia, life revolved around Ma. ""I don't think so, Ma,"" I say. ""He's been very busy, getting this thing up there. They shot it up from what used to be Cape Kennedy. You remember we went there once?"" ""I'll write him a letter and tell him I want to go,"" Ma says. The mysteries of the human brain — I am talking about Ma's now, not Elon Musk's. Before her stroke three years ago, my mother was an adventurous traveler, going to the Amazon, the Nile, the Galápagos. Now she's planning on being among the first visitors to Mars, although lately she's been worrying about the flight taking off without her. My brothers and I tell her that won't happen, Mars isn't ready for tourism. But distinguishing fantasy and reality is harder these days, so here I am at the nursing home, showing Ma the photo of Elon Musk's red Roadster in space, with a guy who for all she knows could be Buzz Aldrin at the wheel. ""Now remember, this isn't a real person, Ma,"" I say. ""It's a mannequin in a spacesuit. The car isn't actually going to Mars, it's going to be circling the sun like Mars and Earth. We're in the same orbit."" ""I'm going,"" Ma says.  This was Mom's medical condition when I got the call from the nursing home doctor: Bronchitis, the chronic obstructive lung disease getting worse, shortness of breath, and of course her longstanding heart disease and diabetes. There was also a discussion about whether hospice or hospital was preferred. ""Do you believe we're looking at the beginning of a dying situation here?"" I had asked. ""No,"" the doctor said. ""We're just looking at a change of status, and it could go either way."" I do think it's the beginning of the end for my mother — not this week or even this month, but I do see a sharper downward trajectory. My mother is sleepier these days, more likely to zone out, more anxious. We do not discuss her death, but I know she believes in some sort of afterlife. I do not. Still there seems to be an image associated with death, of an ascension upward, which many people share. I experienced it years ago myself. I had had an abortion, the psychological aftermath of which was not as simple as I thought it would be, and when I got home, sleeping off the anesthesia, I dreamed of a large cinder, a life that had been snuffed out before it had the opportunity to happen, shooting through space. Why was that image of a snuffed-out life moving through space? Why wasn't it buried in the ground? I understand that nobody wants to dwell on the decay and rot that is a certainty, but why does so much death imagery have to do with moving skyward? One could almost believe there was a biological memory dating to the big bang: Wowza! Did you see that magnificent galactic explosion? I can't help thinking it's the beginning of something big. My mother the galaxy. From star stuff I came and to star stuff I shall return. But first, I'd like to grow a face and see Paris.  My mother was active in two synagogues when she lived in Florida, and one of the things she did was prepare bodies for burial. It's not disturbing, she told me; it's an honor. You wash them, you dress them in a shroud, you sit with them until they're buried so they're not alone. That traditional Jewish burial was what I figured Ma would want for herself. It occurs to me now, however, with Ma's Mars fixation, that she might, when the time comes, enjoy being cremated and shot into space. ""Enjoy"" probably isn't the word, but you know what I'm saying. But I can't see discussing this with Ma. The days are over when she talked about death as another adventure. She is suggestible now, vulnerable to unhappy stories — the other day it was ""King Kong."" She didn't say what upset her, but what could it be other than the tragic, persecuted Kong, furry as the kittens and puppies Ma sometimes thinks sleep with her, in his death spiral off the Empire State Building. And of course, there's that problem with dementia; who's in charge, Pre-Stroke, Adventure Travel Ma or Nursing Home Ma? Actually, the person who is in charge is me. I am my mother's medical advocate, I will have the final word about how it will end, in a hospital or hospice: in a nest of tubes or with a hospice musician playing show tunes? With me telling Ma that Mars is not ready for tourism, or saying I got a call from Elon Musk and he has readied a rocket just for her? I lean toward a journey that will take her toward the stars."
0,2018-03-01," Some signs are subtle, like the ""Whole Foods + Amazon"" one near the bananas. Others are more obvious, like the kiosk with Amazon devices for sale. It has been six months since Amazon took over Whole Foods, a $13.4 billion deal that made the internet retailer a major player in the world of brick-and-mortar retailing. For the most part, the 470 stores are still the same upscale, expensive healthy food emporiums that they have always been. Amazon has grander ambitions as well. The company's executives are busy devising ways to connect its Prime membership program, which offers benefits like fast and free shipping and video streaming, with the stores. The company has said that Prime will eventually become the Whole Foods customer rewards program. It recently took a baby step in the direction of weaving together Prime and Whole Foods by giving Prime members 5 percent back on Whole Foods purchases made with an Amazon-branded Visa card. Whole Foods has signs about the offer all over its checkout stands. Some of the changes Amazon has made are experiments limited to a few locations. Others, like price cuts on grocery staples, are widespread and a sign of more to come, its executives say. ""We're determined to make healthy and organic food affordable for everyone,"" Jeff Wilke, the chief executive of Amazon's worldwide consumer business, has said. Here are a handful of notable changes Amazon has made to Whole Foods so far. Last month, Amazon allowed people to buy thousands of different items from Whole Foods and have them delivered by Prime Now, a speedy Amazon delivery service that uses contractor drivers in their personal cars. The service, available only for Amazon Prime members, offers free two-hour delivery of orders and one-hour delivery for $7.99 on orders over $35. (Driver tips are optional.) Amazon introduced Prime Now delivery for Whole Foods stores in Austin, Tex.; Cincinnati; Dallas; and Virginia Beach. The company said it would expand the service to the rest of the country in 2018. Inside the Austin store, Prime Now orders in brown paper bags wait on shelves and in refrigerators for drivers to come pick them up and spirit them to customers' homes. A banner at the entrance to the store promotes the delivery service. A few days before Amazon completed its acquisition of Whole Foods, it announced a series of price cuts on grocery items, a move to change the perception of the chain as ""Whole Paycheck."" It slashed the price of a dozen Organic Valley large brown eggs by 27 percent and cut the cost of a 16 ounce jar of 365 brand crunch almond butter by 13 percent. For Thanksgiving, it made turkeys cheaper, and for Valentine's Day, it dropped the price on roses. Still, much of the selection in Whole Foods stores still carries premium price tags. Studies by analysts have shown that overall prices on typical Whole Foods shopping expeditions have decreased only slightly. Whole Foods said there was more to come. ""We've done quite a bit,"" Brooke Buchanan, a spokeswoman for the market, said. ""There's still so much more we have planned."" The most conspicuous sign of Amazon's agenda inside Whole Foods is the kiosks containing Amazon electronics that now lurk near store aisles. Not far from the Honeycrisp apples and bulk bins of granola, shoppers can now pick up an Echo, a Fire TV or a Kindle. In a handful of Whole Foods stores, including in Denver and Chicago, Amazon has opened big electronics stands called pop-up shops, which are staffed by Amazon employees who can answer questions about the devices. The pop-up shops, which are at dozens of shopping malls around the country, give shoppers an opportunity to try the devices in person, something they cannot do when they browse online. For years, Amazon has been installing banks of lockers inside and around supermarkets and other buildings, giving people who order items on Amazon a secure place to pick up their packages. The lockers can also be used to return items ordered on Amazon. Since the Whole Foods deal closed, Amazon has put its lockers inside all of the chain's stores. In some stores, the lockers are smaller and tucked among the wine and other goods. The Austin store has a huge bank of lockers near a set of escalators. So far, much of the changes have gone in one direction: injecting a little Amazon into Whole Foods. But a little Whole Foods is being added to Amazon, too. Amazon has sought to bolster Whole Foods by making the chain's private label products available through its various online outlets. Whole Paws, the grocer's pet food brand, and 365 Everyday Value, its line of foods for budget shoppers, can now be purchased through Amazon.com and AmazonFresh, an existing grocery delivery service run by the internet retailer. Amazon even dedicated an area of its automated convenience store in Seattle, Amazon Go, to Whole Foods private label goods."
1,2018-03-01,
0,2018-03-02," Big tech platforms — Amazon, Facebook, Google — control a large and growing share of our commerce and communications, and the scope and degree of their dominance poses real hazards. A bipartisan consensus has formed around this idea. Senator Elizabeth Warren has charged tech giants with using their heft to ""snuff out competition,"" and even Senator Ted Cruz — usually a foe of government regulation — recently warned of their ""unprecedented"" size and power. While the potential tools for redressing the harms vary, a growing chorus is calling for the use of antitrust law. But the decision in a case currently before the Supreme Court could block off that path, by effectively shielding big tech platforms from serious antitrust scrutiny. On Monday the Court heard Ohio v. American Express, a case centering on a technical but critical question about how to analyze harmful conduct by firms that serve multiple groups of users. Though the case concerns the credit card industry, it could have sweeping ramifications for the way in which antitrust law gets applied generally, especially with regards to the tech giants. The case was first brought by the Justice Department against American Express, Visa, and Mastercard for imposing anticompetitive restrictions on merchants. The credit card industry is a classic case of oligopoly. Despite involving millions of merchants and hundreds of millions of cardholders, the credit card business is controlled by four firms. Merchants who need payment networks lack any real bargaining power and have been stuck paying high rates to the oligopoly — steeper costs that ultimately get passed on to consumers. As one might expect, the credit card companies use their power to block competition. American Express did this by imposing conditions on retailers that accept Amex cards. Retailers were told they could not ask their own customers to use, say, a Discover card, over an American Express card, even if Discover would be a cheaper option. Discover could provide a merchant like The Home Depot better terms than American Express — but, because of American Express's restrictions, The Home Depot had no way of reflecting Discover's lower rates to cardholders, thereby keeping Discover's competitive advantage from translating into greater market share. This meant card networks had no reason to compete when serving merchants, keeping prices high. The district court ruled that American Express's ""anti-steering"" provisions stifled price competition and violated the antitrust laws (Mastercard and Visa settled with the government before trial). But when American Express appealed, the Second Circuit reversed, relying on a new concept to create a special set of rules. The concept is that players in ""two-sided"" markets are unique because they serve different sets of customers in distinct but related markets, effectively facilitating transactions. American Express, for example, charges both merchants who accept its cards and consumers who use them. Using this concept, the Second Circuit held that the government would have to show that any price increases for merchants also harmed cardholders, or at least didn't benefit them. In effect, the court introduced a dramatically new rule, making it much more difficult to win important antitrust cases and to stop anticompetitive behavior. The case is now at the Supreme Court. If affirmed, the Second Circuit decision would create de facto antitrust immunity for the most powerful companies in the economy. Since internet technologies have enabled the growth of platform companies that serve multiple groups of users, firms like Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Uber are set to be prime beneficiaries of the Second Circuit's warped analysis. Amazon, for example, could claim status as a two-sided platform because it connects buyers and sellers of goods; Google because it facilitates a market between advertisers and search users. (An industry trade group representing the tech platforms filed an amicus brief in support of American Express.) Indeed, the reason that the tech giants are lining up behind the Second Circuit's approach is that — if ratified — it would make it vastly more difficult to use antitrust laws against them. The fact that the tech platforms could effectively be shielded from antitrust is troubling because, in several respects, these firms enjoy dominant market positions that makes antitrust scrutiny of their conduct especially important. By virtue of providing increasingly critical services, tech giants wield immense leverage over the sellers and buyers that rely on their platforms. This power is ripe for abuse. If the Supreme Court ratifies the Second Circuit's approach, platforms will be able to engage in anticompetitive activity with one set of users, so long as they can plausibly claim that harmful conduct enabled them to benefit another group. Say, for example, that Uber prohibited its drivers from also serving rivals like Lyft, suppressing driver income. Under the current approach, these exclusive agreements would likely violate antitrust law. But under the Second Circuit's analysis, the case would go nowhere unless plaintiffs could show that this practice also harmed riders. This danger is compounded by the slipperiness of the concept underlying this analysis: the idea of a ""two-sided"" market. While reports paid for by the credit card industry introduce ""two-sided"" markets as a novel concept that requires special analysis, markets serving different groups of users have been around for centuries. They include, for example, grain futures exchanges (connecting farmers and buyers of farm products), banking (linking depositors and borrowers) and newspapers (serving advertisers and readers). For decades, courts have recognized that anticompetitive conduct imposed by a newspaper on readers, for example, is no less illegal if it can be shown to benefit advertisers. Indeed, almost all markets can be understood as having two sides. Firms ranging from airlines to meatpackers could reasonably argue that they meet the definition of ""two-sided,"" thereby securing less stringent review. Oral argument on Monday gave little new insight into how the vote breakdown might fall. Justice Neil Gorsuch pushed an aggressively pro-monopoly line of questions, while Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan were skeptical of arguments offered by American Express. While Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. spoke little, his views may prove decisive. He has criticized unwieldy antitrust standards in the past — a problem that would get much worse if the court rules for American Express. Unless the Supreme Court rejects the Second Circuit's approach, it will risk immunizing dominant platforms from effective antitrust review, at the very moment when they most need it."
0,2018-03-07," SEATTLE — Amazon has had no problem getting affluent households to buy from its online store. But people with low incomes have been less loyal to the retailer. Now, Amazon is taking another step to persuade them to spend their money on the site. Starting Tuesday, the company will offer a discount on its Prime membership program to the millions of recipients of Medicaid, the public health insurance program for low-income Americans. They can receive the benefits of Prime — including free fast shipping and video streaming — for $5.99 a month, less than half the standard monthly fee of $12.99. The move expands an effort started last year, when Amazon started offering the Prime discount to people with electronic benefit transfer cards, used to distribute aid for food purchases. The push is a further effort by Amazon to go after shoppers who favor Walmart, which has long been a go-to destination for people on tight budgets. AlixPartner, a financial advisory firm, estimates that Walmart accounts for 18 percent of annual spending through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the formal name for food stamps. Randy Hargrove, a Walmart spokesman, declined to comment directly on Amazon but said, ""While low prices are at the core of who we are, our customer base cuts across all income levels."" Over 68 million people were enrolled in Medicaid at the end of last year, a little over half of them adults. (Amazon says the discount applies to adult holders of Medicaid cards.) Many Medicaid participants also receive electronic benefit transfer cards, and Amazon is ""very pleased with the response so far"" to the discounted Prime membership for those card holders, a company spokeswoman, Julie Law, said. Amazon has been so successful at attracting upper-income consumers that it increasingly needs to go elsewhere in search of growth, analysts said. Its Prime program has been a hit in many households, making shopping on the site a far more practical substitute for going to stores. Prime members can typically have goods delivered free in two days, with many items available for one-day or same-day shipping. Amazon does not say how many Prime members it has. But Sucharita Kodali, an analyst at Forrester Research, a market research company, said a recent survey of shoppers by her firm had found that a majority of American households with annual income over $100,000 had Prime accounts. The membership rate falls off quickly farther down the income scale, she said. There are a number of reasons that low-income consumers have been less avid online shoppers, including the fact that many do not have credit cards. Some may not have secure places to receive packages. ""They are still getting used to the idea of shopping online,"" Ms. Kodali said. Amazon has tried to address some of these obstacles. Amazon Cash, for example, allows people to add money to their Amazon accounts by taking cash to CVS pharmacies, GameStops and other retail locations. Amazon Lockers, installed outside convenience stores and other locations, give people a secure place to pick up and return Amazon packages. Amazon said people can sign up for the discounted Prime membership by going to the company's website and uploading an image of their Medicaid or E.B.T. cards. Like other new Prime subscribers, they can do a free trial of the service for 30 days. Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, said Amazon's move was clearly a grab for a portion of Walmart's customers. But he added that he was not entirely convinced that low-income shoppers would be willing to pay a membership fee, even a reduced one, to shop at an online store. ""Obviously we're talking about a few bucks a month,"" said Mr. Bernstein, who was an economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ""I'm not suggesting that's a lot of money for low-income families, but these families do have to scrutinize their expenditures."""
0,2018-03-08," The health insurance giant Cigna said on Thursday that it had agreed to buy Express Scripts, the nation's largest pharmacy benefit manager, in a $52 billion deal that could further reshape the roiling health care landscape. The deal is the latest in a wave of consolidations that is sweeping through the health care industry. Companies are reacting to concerns over rising health care costs and the possibility of powerful new rivals entering the fray. In particular, Amazon's move into the health care business has forced established companies to rethink how they can compete. Cigna and Express Scripts said the acquisition would benefit consumers by allowing the two companies to bring together patients' medical and pharmacy histories to improve treatments and lower costs. ""This step furthers our strategy to improve the affordability and value to the consumer in a more personalized way,"" said Cigna's chief executive, David Cordani, who will serve as chief executive for the combined company. The completion of the deal would mark the end of Express Scripts as the last major independent pharmacy benefit manager, one that has focused on striking deals with drug companies to lower costs for insurers and employers. The company is responsible for the prescription plans of more than 80 million Americans. ""This is the future of the stand-alone"" pharmacy benefit manager, said Tim Wentworth, the chief executive of Express Scripts, who would serve as president of the Express Scripts business under the deal. The two companies said that they would continue to offer pharmacy services to other insurers and to employers that do not use Cigna. The deal would ensure that all of the major pharmacy benefit managers would have ties to big insurers. CVS Health, which also owns pharmacies, recently announced a merger agreement with the health insurer Aetna. OptumRx is owned by the insurance giant UnitedHealth Group. Anthem, which operates for-profit Blue Cross plans in several states, said it had plans to create its own pharmacy business. With no other large independent pharmacy managers left for smaller insurers, federal and state officials could be reluctant to approve the Cigna-Express Scripts deal, said David A. Balto, an antitrust lawyer who worked at the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department who is a fierce critic of mergers of insurers and pharmacy managers. The CVS-Aetna deal could face the same problem, he said. ""History has shown where there are multiple mergers going on in a single industry, the Justice Department goes on high alert,"" Mr. Balto said. Other antitrust experts said it was unclear how the combination of Cigna and Express Scripts would reshape the market. ""It's not nearly as obvious an antitrust risk as other deals,"" said Leemore S. Dafny, a business professor at Harvard. The deal could make the insurance industry more competitive by giving Cigna, which is not a major player in some markets, a way to challenge the dominant companies, she said. Health insurers, thwarted by federal regulators in their attempts to combine with one another, have been hunting for possible acquisitions. Thursday's deal came little over a year after a judge blocked a proposed $48 billion merger of Cigna and Anthem. A judge also blocked a $37 billion deal between Aetna and another health insurer, Humana, last year. The insurance companies now say they need to integrate the delivery of care and pharmacy benefits into their own operations in order to tackle high medical costs. UnitedHealth, for example, has been acquiring doctors' practices and surgery centers. ""We're seeing a lot of vertical integration,"" said Brian Marcotte, chief executive of the National Business Group on Health, which represents large employers. With insurers looking to operate their own pharmacy managers, ""it seemed like this was the next logical shoe to drop."" Frustration over the rising costs of health care is mounting among employers — who insure most working Americans — and consumers, who are being asked to pay more out of pocket. In January, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway announced plans to team up to address spiraling health care costs. Berkshire's founder, the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, described those costs as a ""growing tapeworm on the American economy."" Adam J. Fein, chief executive of the Drug Channels Institute, which studies the drug industry, said the recent mergers may lead to better coordination because the companies will be looking at health care from multiple angles. ""When you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail,"" he said. ""If everything you are thinking about is pharmacy costs, everything looks like a drug pricing problem."" Some experts, though, see the combinations as potentially harmful. George Slover, senior policy counsel for Consumers Union, which also raised concerns about the Aetna-CVS merger, said in a statement that these deals ""could result in restricted choices throughout the marketplace, ultimately leading to higher costs and potentially poorer coverage and care for consumers."" Craig Garthwaite, a health economist with Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, said that whether consumers ultimately benefit ""will hinge entirely on the amount of competition in the health insurance market."" In recent years, the model of a pharmacy benefit manager has also come under scrutiny. The pharmaceutical industry, among others, argues that benefit managers are profiting from higher drug prices by keeping a percentage for themselves. The Trump administration made a similar argument in February, noting that the top three benefits managers controlled 85 percent of the market. On Wednesday, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, said in a speech that the situation had created ""misaligned incentives,"" as the discounts that manufacturers negotiate ""may not always be passed along to employers or consumers."" Mr. Wentworth, the Express Scripts executive, said the company was ""fully transparent about how the money flows and the contracts we do."""
1,2018-03-08," For weeks, users of Amazon's digital assistant, Alexa, have reported versions of the same unsettling event: being startled as they went about their day by Alexa letting out an eerie laugh. Now, Amazon says that it knows why that's been happening and is working to fix the problem. ""In rare circumstances, Alexa can mistakenly hear the phrase 'Alexa, laugh,'"" when other words are spoken, Amazon said in an emailed statement. ""We are changing that phrase to be 'Alexa, can you laugh?' which is less likely to have false positives, and we are disabling the short utterance 'Alexa, laugh.'"" The company also said that instead of simply laughing when asked, the digital assistant, which is accessible through its line of Echo and Fire devices, will first acknowledge the request, saying, ""Sure, I can laugh."" One user said on Twitter that he was talking to his sister when he heard his device laugh. He had stopped the conversation and began searching online for an explanation of what had just occurred. Finding nothing, he asked Alexa to repeat the last sound she had made. Another Twitter user reported being startled by Alexa's laugh, at first thinking there was a child in the room. The episode underscored the concerns swirling around Echo and other smart speakers, like Google Home, which often sit in intimate spaces, awaiting a call to action. Critics have argued that the always-on devices pose a threat to privacy and security. There have been reports of children ordering items through the devices without parental consent, and last year Burger King took advantage of the devices by incorporating a command into a commercial. Despite those concerns, the technology has been widely embraced. Reports vary on just how many Americans use such devices, but all suggest that adoption is relatively high. On Tuesday, for example, the polling organization Gallup and Northeastern University reported that about one in five American adults use an intelligent home device such as Alexa, Google Home or other competing devices. Amazon sold tens of millions of Alexa devices during the recent holiday season, with analysts saying that the Echo accounts for more than 70 percent of smart speaker sales."
0,2018-03-09," If the strength of a handshake is a sign of character, then Giovanni Ribisi's is rock solid. Still, if you've watched him in Amazon's ""Sneaky Pete,"" now back for its second season, you might be inclined to check if your watch is missing afterward. Mr. Ribisi plays Marius Josipovic, a con man with a sleight of hand so keen that he can beach a whale at the poker table, then, a split-second later, hijack his mark's Rolex and wallet. Created by Bryan Cranston and David Shore, the series began as Marius exited prison with a price on his head and assumed the identity of his cellmate, Pete Murphy (Ethan Embry), before moving in with Pete's long-lost grandparents — owners of a bail bonds business with tricks up their own sleeves. ""It's the group of people that really matters on a TV show, more than any other experience,"" said Mr. Ribisi, whose co-stars include Marin Ireland, Margo Martindale and, new this season, Jane Adams. During a visit to New York from Los Angeles, where he lives when not shooting ""Sneaky Pete"" in Brooklyn and upstate, Mr. Ribisi, 43, spoke about the art of the con and reprising his role as the corporate villain Parker Selfridge in four coming sequels to ""Avatar,"" which made nearly $3 billion worldwide after its release in 2009. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.  So if things go according to plan, you'll eventually volley between shooting ""Sneaky Pete"" in New York and ""Avatar"" in California for the next few years? There it is. [Laughs] You've summarized my life. It's an interesting thing to come to New York and do a television show. You're doing 10 hours of content in four and a half months. Eighty-hour weeks are par for the course. But it's been worth it. Because the intention is to spend several years with the cast and the crew and to cultivate that dynamic. Where do we find Marius-Pete in Season 2? Honestly, I'm still trying to digest all of it. This season is definitely bigger and more sprawling, and there's a lot more complexity, in the best way. Essentially at the end of Season 1, there's two thugs that talk about $11 million — and opposed to seeing that as a threat, Marius sees that as an opportunity. It leaned into the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, like a heist scenario. But I should say that nothing in this season is what it appears. I take it the big draw for you was Mr. Cranston. The show was originally with CBS, and Bryan was the fulcrum for me. He's just such an inspiration, one of the great American actors, and I am very much a ""Breaking Bad"" fan. But the network TV show aspect was something I wasn't sure of. And then when it became novelistic, seasonal arcs with Amazon, it just became undeniable. Especially with that cast.  How did you capture Pete's sneakiness? There's a great book called ""The Confidence Game."" It's about the victim's propensity to being conned, and an almost subconscious desire for that, as opposed to the psychology behind why somebody would choose that way of life. It's safe to say that we've all experienced having the wool pulled over our heads. Have you? Not that I know of. [Voice fades away] But yes, actually I have been conned, very much so. And that's part of the psychology of it — the embarrassment of that. Do those four ""Avatar"" sequels preclude having a life between now and forever? I start in 2019, and it could be years, here and there. But I like the idea of being committed and having something in your life beyond the personal that you have to be devoted to for a decade. That's where you find mastery. Can you say anything about the story? Oh God, no. That's not my business to do so. But I'm so excited to go and work on those films. I had a chance to read the four sequels, and it's one of those things where you can't even imagine how it would be possible. They spent 10 years developing the story, and it's so far beyond my expectations. You've been acting since you were 9. Was that your ""I want to be a fireman"" dream? How could I have avoided it? I was brought up during the blockbuster era. ""Star Wars"" was the first film I saw. I was 2 years old. And here's what's trippy: My first memory is of being with my father, walking in to see the sequel, and him asking if I remember seeing the first one. Can you pinpoint the moment when you realized you actually were an actor? I still haven't gotten there. [Pause] But this is a good thing. That you still have something to aspire to? Oh my God, yes. I mean, what else is there, other than the thing that you dreamed about being before you were 10 years old?"
0,2018-03-10," Greta Gerwig's coming-of-age story is streaming. And Rachel Weisz plays a mysterious widow in an adaptation of a Daphne du Maurier novel. LADY BIRD (2017) on iTunes and Amazon. ""What is 'Boyhood,' but for a girl? What is 'The 400 Blows,' but for a girl? What is personhood for young women?"" That's Greta Gerwig speaking about her film ""Lady Bird"" at the New York Film Festival. Set in Sacramento in the early aughts, the movie stars Saoirse Ronan as the titular character, whose nickname is self-assigned. In the waning days of her Catholic high school career, Lady Bird navigates college applications, the limitations of her family's economic situation and the tension between platonic relationships and romantic ones.

The Venezuelan director Jorge Thielen Armand's film, set among the struggle of Venezuela's ongoing economic crisis, is centered on a young father who learns that the decrepit mansion his family squats in will soon be demolished.

THE BIG LEBOWSKI (1998) on iTunes, Amazon and YouTube. When the Coen brothers released their labyrinthine follow-up to ""Fargo"" 20 years ago, The Times critic Janet Maslin cautioned that the plot ""need not be taken too seriously."" Many of the film's devotees, however, seem to have ignored that advice. Jeff Bridges's pacifist stoner, the Dude, and his rug-recovery odyssey have inspired festivals, multiple books, a now-shuttered store in Greenwich Village and a pseudo-religion — all of which seem to have taken the Dude very seriously, if usually with a red-eyed wink. For the not-yet-enlightened, the film follows Mr. Bridges's idiosyncratic character in a Los Angeles of the George H. W. Bush era. After a case of mistaken identity, he's drawn into a plot that involves kidnapping, a stolen rug, In-N-Out Burger and an abiding infatuation with bowling. SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE 11:30 p.m. on NBC.

In Roger Michell's film adaptation of the Daphne du Maurier novel, Rachel Weisz plays either a grieving widow or a woman who murdered her husband; the mystery is which one her character, Rachel, is. The story is told from the perspective of Philip Ashley (Sam Claflin), a farmer in seaside Britain whose guardian, Ambrose (also Mr. Claflin), marries Rachel while living abroad. Then, Ambrose dies. With her husband gone, Rachel travels to Britain. His guardian gone, Philip begins to fall for Rachel. In The Times, Manohla Dargis wrote that the film ""is good enough to make you wish it were better."""
0,2018-03-13," ""Whatever way that people read books, I'm going to get them into my store — I don't care if I have to stock contact lenses that let the words scroll across your eyes."" Let's hope it doesn't come to that for Noëlle Santos, who will open The Lit Bar in the Bronx this spring — part of a continuing resurgence of independent booksellers in New York City. Shakespeare and Company is opening two new stores this year, in Greenwich Village and on the Upper West Side. The latter is considered a homecoming for the original Shakespeare and Company, which was an institution in that neighborhood from 1982 to 1996, and it will be joining a robust range of indies in the area including Word Up, Books of Wonder, Bank Street Bookstore and several branches of Book Culture (the one on Columbus Avenue is in the space once occupied by the beloved Endicott Booksellers). Maybe, just maybe, the late great Nora Ephron was wrong. Twenty years ago, her film ""You've Got Mail"" seemed to punctuate the death sentence of independent bookstores. Between 1995 and 2009, the number of indies in the United States declined by 43 percent, according to the American Booksellers Association, a trade organization for independently owned bookstores. Over the past two decades, New York City institutions such as St. Mark's Bookshop, Coliseum Books and Murder Ink bit the dust. Big boxes — really big boxes — seemed to be winning. E-books entered the market. And then there was Amazon. ""We're never going to beat Amazon at Amazon's game, but I think there is a craving for going back to the old New York,"" said Dane Neller, chief executive of Shakespeare and Company. Multiple branches and plans for a national presence (with a Philadelphia store opening this summer) put Shakespeare and Company in the small chain category, but Mr. Neller wants to create ""the biggest little bookshop in the world,"" intimate and localized, with a high level of service. Any New Yorker knows that indies in many fields have struggled in recent years. Mom-and-pop hardware stores and pharmacies have given way to Home Depots and RiteAids. But when the product is books, the losses feel particularly egregious. ""The popular presumption was that independent booksellers were a thing of the past, some vestige of a different time and place,"" said Oren Teicher, chief executive of the A.B.A. ""It was inaccurate as a depiction then as now, but it's pretty difficult to convince people otherwise."" The number of A.B.A. member bookstores has risen steadily for the seventh year in a row, and their sales are up. ""In New York, it was never about attracting the customers but about the landlords who kept raising the rent,"" Mr. Teicher said. ""Independent bookstores play a vital role in communities. There's a passion and a knowledge about putting the right book into the customer's hand, and it's something we do far better than anyone else."" ""The most fun part of being a bookseller is hand-selling people things they didn't know they needed,"" said Emma Straub, a best-selling novelist and co-owner with her husband of Books Are Magic, which replaced the beloved BookCourt in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, 10 months ago. (The word ""beloved"" comes up frequently when discussing independent bookstores.) ""We would never have opened in a million years if our local bookstore hadn't closed,"" Ms. Straub said. ""As a bookseller and a writer, I understand the importance of stores like Barnes & Noble. I have no interest in talking smack about the chains. But an independent bookstore is all about understanding your customers and giving them what they need. It needs to be of its place and for its place."" Starting an independent bookstore in a borough with few book-buying options might seem like a giant leap of faith, but for Ms. Santos of The Lit Bar, it's the culmination of a dream begun three years ago when she learned that the local Barnes & Noble would close. ""Being an avid reader, that spoke to me on personal level,"" she said. ""While I appreciated Barnes & Noble when it was there, you would never know that you were in the Bronx. It didn't offer a lot of opportunities for the community. If you were a local author, good luck in getting your book on the shelf. But with an independent store, you can feel the energy of the neighborhood reflected in the choices. I couldn't think of a better way for people to engage and become real neighbors."" There's a difference between surviving and thriving for some indies. ""Thriving is a tough word,"" said Christine Onorati of Word in Greenpoint, Brooklyn (with a branch in Jersey City). ""We have people who are unbelievably loyal to us, and we're digging in, trying to make our mark, but it's a tough business."" Rent is a challenge for many. Miles Bellamy opened Spoonbill and Sugartown in Brooklyn's Williamsburg neighborhood almost 19 years ago, long before there was a Whole Foods and an Apple store, but he recently saw his rent almost double, to $14,500 a month from $8,000 a month. ""Just as I go to both the local drugstore and Duane Reade, book lovers can support my store and buy books online,"" Mr. Bellamy said. ""I feel like a better person when I go into the small store. But the pressure is constant. It's a full-time hustle."" There is an opportunity for certain industries to reinvent themselves after a large shock in their business model or in technology, according to Ryan L. Raffaelli, assistant professor at Harvard Business School, who has been studying independent bookstores for about five years. (He even took a course in how to open one.) ""What I've found is that the indies are able to compete on several dimensions,"" he said. ""One is community. They championed the notion of 'shop local' and 'Small Business Saturday.' Another is curation: They're not just offering best-sellers but diamonds in the rough. They've taken back a sense of pride in what they can provide: a deeper and ongoing relationship with their customers. In high-rent districts, because profit margins are relatively thin, success must come from multiple repeat customers, so that the customer can't imagine not visiting as part of his or her monthly routine. They're also flirting with adapting newer forms of technology."" That's what Mr. Neller is banking on. Each of the planned new Shakespeare and Company stores will have an Espresso Book Machine (Mr. Neller is also head of the manufacturer, On Demand Books) that has the potential to print and bind any book not on the shelves while you're having a cappuccino at the store's cafe. (Since Mr. Neller is the former chief executive of Dean & DeLuca, the new stores will definitely have baristas and snacks.) ""It's really a renaissance,"" he said, ""a new permutation that will have elements of the mom-and-pop blended with technology, allowing a store to have a practically infinite selection in a small setting. We'll take a digital file and convert it into an analog product, putting the warehouse inside a small footprint. That's transformative."" It's almost like a new happy ending to ""You've Got Mail."" Somewhere, Nora is smiling."
0,2018-03-14," The path to fast and affordable online grocery service is littered with obstacles: refrigeration challenges, storage woes and high transportation costs, among others. But the country's largest retailers are convinced that it will lead to a lucrative and largely untapped market. And they are all rushing to dominate it first. Walmart escalated the competition on Wednesday by announcing plans to expand its online grocery delivery service to 100 metropolitan areas by the end of the year. Orders will be fulfilled at more than 800 stores nationwide and shuttled to shoppers by drivers contracted through Uber, Deliv and other ride and delivery platforms. Customers must order at least $30 worth of goods and pay an additional delivery fee of $9.95; they can receive their purchases in as little as four hours if they put in the request by 1 p.m. The plan puts the world's largest retailer on a direct collision course with the world's most powerful e-commerce player, Amazon, which purchased the Whole Foods grocery chain for $13.4 billion last summer and recently announced plans to use those stores to fill on-demand orders. Other retailers like Costco, Target and Kroger are also joining the increasingly expensive battle for customers who want eggs and milk without leaving their couch. ""There is a lot of experimenting going on as everyone tries to figure out that last-mile delivery — it's a tough economic equation to make work,"" said Mike Knemeyer, a professor of logistics at Ohio State University. ""But if you can, you'll have a big head start on the others, and you'll end up making money not just in groceries but on all of the things that you sell."" The nexus of e-commerce and grocery sales is increasingly appealing to retailers. ""The thing that's great about grocery is that it's a pure traffic driver — no matter who you are, you need to get groceries every two weeks, which makes it an exception from all the other categories that keep retailers up at night,"" said Matt Sargent, a retail expert at the consulting firm Magid. But while the total grocery market is enormous — nearly $1 trillion annually in the United States — many customers still insist on seeing and touching their food in person before buying. Spending on online groceries is currently just $27 billion a year, or 3 percent of the total, according to Forrester Research, which specializes in technology. Controlling costs is another major challenge. Grocery providers have grappled with the expense of packaging delicate produce and meats in ice packs and dispatching fleets of company-owned vehicles from distribution centers staffed around the clock. Even Amazon has struggled. The company launched its AmazonFresh service in the Seattle area in 2007 and tested it for years before expanding it to more than 20 cities. Customers pay $14.99 a month — in addition to their $99-a-year Prime membership — to have groceries sent directly to them. But late last year, the company decided to pull AmazonFresh from some markets. ""There's no question that online grocery has been a challenge for everyone, including Amazon,"" said Sucharita Kodali, an analyst at Forrester. ""The reason is it's just really, really hard to get the last mile going."" But Amazon touched off a flurry of activity with its acquisition of Whole Foods in June. In October, Costco introduced a two-day delivery option for dry groceries and a same-day program for fresh goods through Instacart, a delivery service. Target said in December that it would purchase the online same-day delivery service Shipt for $550 million in cash. Amazon, which has several brick-and-mortar grocery options in Seattle, said this month that it had begun to offer same-day delivery of groceries from Whole Foods in six cities and would expand the program to the rest of the country later this year. The program is run through Amazon's Prime Now service, which relies on contractors to make deliveries in their personal cars within two hours of an order being placed. The service is free to Prime customers, but Amazon automatically adds an optional tip. Kroger soon followed Amazon's lead with an announcement that it would expand the number of cities eligible for home delivery of groceries through Instacart. Walmart's Sam's Club division, which said last month it would offer members free shipping of online orders for an annual $100 fee, also uses Instacart. But Walmart said that it would not tap Instacart for the grocery delivery program at its Walmart stores, which it said would reach more than 40 percent of American households. ""We're saving customers time by leveraging new technology, and connecting all the parts of our business into a single seamless shopping experience: great stores, easy pickup, fast delivery, and apps and websites that are simple to use,"" Greg Foran, the chief executive of Walmart U.S., said in a statement. The company has made substantial investments in its growing suite of online offerings, including a partnership with Google to sell Walmart products on Google Express and the creation of Store No. 8, an internal venture to help develop new online businesses. In the fall, Walmart bought Parcel, a 24-hour delivery service that uses algorithms and leased vehicles to send perishable and nonperishable products to customers in New York City. On Wednesday, Walmart also reiterated that it planned to expand its curbside grocery pickup service to 1,000 more locations this year, in addition to the 1,200 locations where it is already offered. The service allows customers to order food online and collect it at Walmart stores. But Walmart's e-commerce success has sometimes been fickle — its online sales increased 23 percent in its most recent quarter, less than half the rate of growth in each of the previous three quarters and a performance that sent a ripple of nervousness through the stock market. Walmart's expanded delivery service requires that customers visit the company's website or grocery app to place orders. The chain will then have one of its 18,000 personal shoppers collect the selected items in stores. Each of those employees — along with the thousands more that Walmart said it would add this year — undergoes a three-week training program that teaches them how to pick the best meats and produce. As specialists, they are paid more than the company's entry-level workers. Beefing up its grocery delivery service is an ""informed gamble"" for Walmart, Mr. Knemeyer said — one that will most likely serve up side benefits such as data collection and inroads with young, affluent city dwellers. The chain, long known as a discount retailer, has lately been trying to broaden its appeal. It spent $3.3 billion acquiring Jet.com, a bulk online retailer that Walmart said would give it access to ""urban and millennial customers."" In 2017, it purchased the hip e-commerce brands Bonobos and ModCloth. Last month, it unveiled what it called an ""Instagram-worthy"" collection of mattresses and bedding, available through a separate website. But the supercenters for which Walmart is best known tend to exist on the outskirts of cities and in rural areas. Breaking into metropolitan grocery ecosystems, which often support an already robust network of delivery services for grocery chains and restaurants alike, could be difficult, experts said. And the feature of groceries that make them so attractive to retailers — they are regularly consumed and so must be regularly replenished — makes most consumers unwilling to splurge on them. Walmart's $9.95 fee on each order is a much more visible cost to consumers compared to Amazon's annual $99 fee for its Prime membership, which many shoppers set to auto-pay and then forget. ""They probably just look at the relatively high delivery fee and get scared off,"" said Matthias Winkenbach, director of M.I.T.'s Megacity Logistics Lab. ""Walmart would have to do a very good job communicating the overall economics of shopping their everyday low prices versus Amazon."""

Sales plummeted, as Amazon captured more children's desires — and their parents' wallets — for Star Wars Legos and Paw Patrol recycling trucks. Toys ""R"" Us is the latest failure of financial engineering, albeit one that could portend a potentially more ominous outlook for private equity in the digital era. Most buyouts tend to work the same way. A private equity firm takes over a troubled company with the goal of sprucing up the strategy, cutting costs and overhauling the business over three or five years. But they often load up a company with debt to pay for the deal, which can prove problematic if the profits do not perk up. In the age of Amazon, that formula can be dangerous. Consumer demands are changing so quickly that heavily indebted companies have trouble reordering their business to adapt and compete with better-funded rivals. [ READ MORE: ""It's kind of a punch in the gut for us to see how much online shopping has affected things."" Customers across the United States told us what Toys ""R"" Us meant to them. Here's what they had to say » ] A wave of buyouts has collapsed in recent weeks, felled by digital competition. Struggling in the streaming music age, iHeartMedia, the large radio company saddled with debt since its 2008 buyout, filed for bankruptcy this week. The regional New York grocery chain Tops filed for bankruptcy last month, citing competition from Amazon and the debt burden that its former private equity backers had heaped on it. Other buyouts are looking shaky. The television company Univision, which recently scrapped plans for a public offering, is shaking up its leadership. The parent company of the Winn-Dixie supermarket chain said this week it was seeking to restructure its debt, as it planned to close stores. Not all troubled private equity deals end with a company winding down, as in the case of Toys ""R"" Us. Retailers like Gymboree and Payless ShoeSource have found second lives after emerging from bankruptcy, often with investments from new private equity or hedge fund owners willing to give the business another try. But the deterioration of Toys ""R"" Us from a potential turnaround strategy to the end of an iconic brand — in a matter of months — shows just how difficult it can be for private equity to compete in a rapidly evolving industry. In retailing, Amazon is reordering everything on the store shelf. And children's changing interest in games and toys, which now encompasses high-end electronics, adds to the complexity. The company said on Thursday that it had no other option than to begin winding down about 730 stores around the United States. Toys ""R"" Us was still looking at the possibility of keeping 200 stores open and combining them with its Canadian operations. But no deal had been struck yet. ""This is a profoundly sad day for us,"" the Toys ""R"" Us chief executive, David Brandon, said in a statement, ""as well as for the millions of kids and families who we have served for the past 70 years."" The toy business looked a lot simpler in 2005, when the private equity firms Bain Capital and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the real estate firm Vornado Realty Trust acquired the company for $6.6 billion. The investor group figured the toy industry was ripe for consolidation. After the buyout, Toys ""R"" Us bought the famed toy seller F.A.O. Schwarz as well as the brand and website of KB Toys. The company had become the world's largest ""toy showroom,"" its shelves stocked with thousands of different actions figures, video games and other wares from large suppliers like Mattel and Hasbro as well as smaller brands that make stuffed animals and glow-in-the-dark slime. Sales were strong, even after the recession. The company had considered going public, giving its private equity owners a way to cash out. But the company scrapped the offering in 2013, citing unfavorable market conditions. Enter Amazon. In recent years, the company had started to aggressively expand its toy business, creating a comprehensive, online showroom with low prices at the click of a button. Pressed by Amazon, Walmart also pushed hard into toys, dropping its prices to capture more market share. Walmart could absorb the price cuts on toys because it makes up the profit on other items. But for Toys ""R"" Us, a price war on toys and games, its only offerings, was devastating. In 2015, the company hired Mr. Brandon as chief executive. The former head of the University of Michigan's athletic department, he helped turn around Domino's Pizza, another private equity investment. But he lacked extensive experience in the toy industry. By the time he joined Toys ""R"" Us, the company faced a conundrum. After a lack of investment, its stores were in need of a serious overhaul. Many American customers complained about its sprawling spaces and tired displays. But it was unclear whether those investments would pay off when parents were shopping increasingly on their laptops and smartphones. Money, too, was tight. Most of its debt, totaling about $5 billion, had not been paid down since the buyout 12 years earlier. It was paying $400 million in interest payments each year. ""This company had a long history of taking on debt and kicking the can down the road for 10 years, and refinancing,"" said Douglas M. Foley, a lawyer at McGuireWoods, who is representing a lender in the Toys ""R"" Us bankruptcy. With sales falling and debt payments mounting, the company's lawyer said in September that Toys ""R"" Us had ""too much debt."" It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, seeking to shed some of its debt and reorganize its business. The company secured new loans to keep operating into the critical holiday selling season and said it would hire hundreds of seasonal workers to help improve customer service. But the holidays were a bust for Toys ""R"" Us, even as other retailers reported strong sales. On Thursday, the company said that its earnings during the shopping season were $250 million less than expected. The lenders, which had given the company considerable leeway during the holidays, lost confidence in the turnaround plan. ""The business plan was underwhelming, that is best way to say it,"" Mr. Foley said. The company has been hemorrhaging money. Mr. Foley calculated that the company had spent nearly $50 million on legal, banking and consulting fees from September through January. The lenders determined that they needed to stop burning through cash and start selling off the company's inventory and real estate. The company said on Thursday that it talked to several possible buyers of its American operations. But it could not complete a sale, leading to its demise. ""The retail industry is going through such a convulsion, it is not clear what the end of the road looks like,"" said Stephen B. Selbst, a bankruptcy lawyer at Herrick Feinstein. ""If you are an equity investor, you probably think 'you know what? I have other uses for my money."""
0,2018-03-16," SAINT-CLOUD, France — He is still the ""Devil of the Republic,"" as his nickname would have it, a national politician who haunts the French imagination like no other. The proof: Jean-Marie Le Pen's newly published memoir is a big best seller, even though the patriarch of France's far right never came close to attaining high office, is nearly 90, and has been pushed out of the National Front by his own daughter Marine nearly 50 years after he founded the party. His unrepentant extremism — on race, World War II, the Holocaust, gender, torture, immigrants — led Ms. Le Pen to kick him out. Those views can still shock and titillate, and his compatriots are lapping them up. ""The migration phenomenon,"" Mr. Le Pen began, in an interview at the gloomy old mansion in the Paris suburbs he inherited years ago from a wealthy acolyte, ""is a tsunami."" He added grimly, ""They have a fertility rate three times ours."" Immigrants, Mr. Le Pen said, ""are more and more numerous and visible, especially when it's Africans."" It was a theme he returned to obsessively over the course of an hour in his study last week. ""Fils de la Nation,"" or ""Son of the Nation,"" the first of two planned volumes of memoirs, shot to the top of Amazon's best-seller list last week, and the initial 50,000 print run has already sold out, says the publisher, Muller, a small right-wing house that took the book after more prestigious French publishers refused it. Meanwhile, the National Front is carrying on without its founder. For the first time ever he did not attend the party's congress last Saturday. Changing the party's name, as Marine Le Pen envisions doing, is ""suicidal,"" Mr. Le Pen grumbled. He lost elections for more than a half-century, but Mr. Le Pen feels he is now getting the last laugh. He is not surprised by his success in the bookstores. ""I was a man of good will who never knew political success,"" he said. He was seated heavily in an antique pink armchair, elaborate ship models around him recalling his childhood in a Brittany fishing village. ""But my ideas have made progress, even in the programs of my opponents. That's why my struggle was not without value,"" Mr. Le Pen continued, smiling slightly. Indeed, the hard-line immigration policies of the current French president, Emmanuel Macron, sound like a distant echo of the far-right patriarch. Mr. Le Pen dismisses them as ""purely for show."" But the Macron policy emphasizes limits and expulsions. These respond to an anxiety most French now feel about migrants, as demonstrated in polling. That anxiety was responsible for Mr. Le Pen's greatest electoral successes, limited though these were. But as much as his well-known views — his admiration for France's collaborationist World War II leader, Marshal Pétain; his hatred of the country's liberator, Charles de Gaulle; his casual anti-Semitism and racism; his approval of torture in the Algerian war — it is the sense that Mr. Le Pen's long life encompasses the whole sweep of postwar French history, albeit darkly, that accounts in part for his current bookstore triumph. ""I can't say it completely astonishes me,"" said Eric Roussel, a historian who wrote an early book about Mr. Le Pen. ""There's been a change in the society. Not everyone who buys it is necessarily a Le Pen voter. His age means he's awarded the status of a senior witness. There are not that many left."" Mr. Le Pen seems also to have gained begrudging respect for raising the immigration issue early on and persevering, Mr. Roussel said: ""People are saying, 'He raised a problem that does exist.' His idea that he was a sentinel, that's beginning to impose itself."" Mr. Le Pen's book is a mirror of the postwar decades, and is part of a well-entrenched tradition of far-right, anti-Semitic writers — Charles Maurras, Louis-Ferdinand Céline — which has had a large purchase on French cultural life. Their writings, and questions over whether they should be republished or honored, continue to make headlines here many years after their deaths. Mr. Le Pen is still very much alive, writing in vivid colloquial prose of a life in a string of fascinating chapters: as a war part-orphan, having lost his fisherman father to a mine in 1942 when he was 14, making him a ""pupil of the Nation,"" as they were designated; as a boisterous law student in postwar Paris, already militating at the far-right edge; as a French Foreign Legion paratrooper who volunteered to fight the Vietminh in an already-lost colonial war in 1953 out of ""patriotism""; as a parliamentary deputy in 1956, the youngest in France, hurling a vicious anti-Semitic insult at the revered former prime minister Pierre Mendès France; as a tough-talking paratrooper in the battle of Algiers who defended his colleagues' use of torture but denied practicing it himself (he later lost a libel suit over the issue); and, finally, as the marginally employed, far-right agitator who, pushed along by a buddy who was a wartime Nazi collaborator, François Brigneau, founded the National Front in 1972 as, Mr. Le Pen said, ""the grandest French adventure since World War II."" He was only a teenager during the war, but the experience was formative. Defying his mother's warning he looked at his father's battered remains when they washed up on a Brittany beach and was deeply shocked. ""My mother cried all day, and I heard her sobbing at night,"" Mr. Le Pen writes. Later, he made a farcical attempt to join a resistance unit in Brittany. ""My first war decoration"" was a ""magisterial slap"" from his outraged mother when he returned home, Mr. Le Pen writes. That unheroic foray, rendered in self-mocking prose, was one of the formative elements in the creation of an outrageous contrarianism that runs through the pages of his memoir. ""He's reached the goal of his life, to be a national agitator,"" said Mr. Roussel, the historian, using the French word provocateur. ""His goal was never to attain power."" Thus, in Mr. Le Pen's pages French S.S. volunteers are to be defended: ""Must I then say that those who signed up for the crusade against Bolshevism on the Eastern Front were traitors?"" he writes. And, of course, the German military is to be exculpated, as having acted honorably. France's postwar purge aimed at collaborators is to be excoriated. ""No doubt the discipline imposed by the Germans was painful,"" Mr. Le Pen writes, referring to the harshness of the occupation for ordinary French citizens. But that same discipline, he declares, ""was also applied — and rigorously — to their own troops."" That view, excusing the Germans, is not shared by reputable historians or by French citizens generally. The postwar purge ""allowed any old armed nobody pushed along by ideologues to massacre at leisure: and from that point of view it was worse than the Occupation,"" Mr. Le Pen writes. General de Gaulle was a ""horrible source of pain"" for the French, a ""false 'great man,' "" while Marshal Pétain, the leader of the Vichy government during World War II, ""didn't fail to uphold honor"" in making a separate peace with the Nazis. Pétain later fervently sought to collaborate with them, a fact Mr. Le Pen elides. As the daylight faded from his study Mr. Le Pen returned unprompted to the Holocaust, the subject on which he made what historians consider perhaps his greatest transgression, and the one that sank the fortunes of the National Front. He has repeatedly called the gas chambers a ""detail"" in the history of World War II. ""Look, the gas chambers, I didn't personally see them,"" Mr. Le Pen said. Turning angry, he said, ""Cost me 30,000 euros"" — in fines, about $37,000, for Holocaust denial, which is a crime in France. ""Well, that was a pretty lightweight pretext to ostracize me, anyway,"" he concluded."
0,2018-03-18," KERNERSVILLE, N.C. — As soon as the first robot arrived at a FedEx shipping hub in the heart of North Carolina tobacco country early last year, talk of pink slips was in the air. Workers had been driving the ""tuggers"" that navigated large and irregular items across the vast concrete floor of the 630,000-square-foot freight depot since it opened in 2011. Their initial robotic colleague drew a three-dimensional digital map of the place as it tugged freight around. A few months later, three other robots — nicknamed Lucky, Dusty and Ned in a nod to the movie ""¡Three Amigos!"" — arrived, using the digital map to get around on their own. By March, they were joined by two others, Jefe and El Guapo. Horns honking and warning lights flashing, the autonomous vehicles snaked through the hub, next to about 20 tuggers that still needed humans behind the wheel. The robot team, part of the automation trend rippling through the worlds of shipping and online retailing, was the first significant deployment of mobile robots inside a FedEx hub. Amazon and our e-commerce shopping habits are big reasons it's happening. In 2012, Amazon acquired a robotics company called Kiva. Since then, it has moved many of that company's robots into its network of more than 210 fulfillment and package-sorting centers. Now, many Amazon partners and competitors are moving in the same direction, including big shipping and logistics operations like FedEx and DHL. But what has happened at the FedEx hub may be a surprise to people who fear that they are about to be replaced by a smart machine: a robot might take your role, but not necessarily your job. Yes, the robots replaced a few jobs right away. And in time, they will replace about 25 jobs in a facility that employs about 1,300 people. But the hub creates about 100 new jobs every year — and a robot work force still seems like the distant future. ""Everyone will have a job,"" said Galen Steele, the senior manager who oversees the depot. ""It just might be in a different place."" As people have become more comfortable buying online, big and bulky goods like car tires, canoes and boxes as big as a coffin have accounted for an increasing percentage of the packages flowing through FedEx's distribution centers, said Ted Dengel, who oversees operations technology for the FedEx Ground network, which includes 35 shipping hubs across the United States and Canada, including the facility in North Carolina. These ungainly items can't fit on a conveyor belt. That's where the robots, which cost several thousand dollars and are made by a Massachusetts company called Vecna, come in. Kernersville, the home of the FedEx hub, sits in the middle of the North Carolina Piedmont, the plateau between the coastal lowlands in the east and the mountains in the west, in an area that used to be known as the Tobacco Road. In the 20th century, it embraced textile and apparel manufacturing. But as automation has increased inside factories and textile work has moved overseas, the local economy has sputtered. ""In the middle of a boom elsewhere, things really aren't that great here,"" said Andrew Brod, senior research fellow at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro, who tracks the local economy. The local unemployment rate is 4.6 percent, modestly above the 4.1 percent national rate. Mr. Brod estimates that the arrival of distribution centers like the one FedEx opened in 2011 has provided a boost, creating as many as 120,000 jobs, a majority of which go to workers with no more than a high school education. And Mr. Steele, the manager of the FedEx facility in Kernersville, did not envision pink slips when he saw the first Vecna robot. ""I understand people thinking this will take their jobs,"" Mr. Steele said on a recent Monday morning inside the hub. ""But over time, they realize that is not the case at all."" But those fears were not unfounded. In a recent report, the McKinsey Global Institute, a business research organization, predicted that about one-third of workers in the United States will have to switch occupations because of technology-driven automation by 2030. ""What people underestimate is the time needed for this to happen,"" said Michael Chui, a partner with McKinsey. Workers who once spent part of their time driving tuggers might spend more time lifting boxes onto trailers or stacking those boxes inside delivery trucks bound for other parts of the country. But over all, the work force inside the hub will grow, not shrink, Mr. Steele said. For Mr. Steele, a 24-year FedEx veteran, this is just another step on a long and gradual climb toward greater automation — a march that began decades ago with automatic scanners and sorters. The North Carolina hub is already highly automated; more than 80 percent of packages move across the facility through a system of conveyor belts, scanners and sorters that needs no human labor. When a truck filled with packages arrives, workers load the bulky items onto trailers hitched to a robot. Once these trailers are full, they press a button that sends the vehicle on its way. Equipped with laser-based sensors, cameras and other navigation tools, the robots stop when people or other vehicles get in the way. In some cases, they even figure out a new way to go. But most of the work in this facility still requires human dexterity. Modern robots are not nimble enough to unload a truck filled with randomly sized boxes or pack those boxes onto a truck at the other end of the hub. ""People are remarkably good at handling lots of different shapes and amazingly good at fitting those things into tight spaces,"" said Dave Clark, who oversees robotics work at Amazon. ""Machines, today, can't keep pace."" These companies, however, will continue to automate as much of the process as they can. The online retail and shipping markets continue to grow, and with Amazon setting new standards for fast and inexpensive delivery, everyone else has to keep up. That means more shipping centers and more workers — both machines and humans. The need for automation is particularly acute in areas with low unemployment. RK Logistics, a small company that runs a shipping warehouse in Livermore, Calif., — with the help of three mobile robots — has had trouble hiring. The pool of available workers is low — the local unemployment rate is around 2.7 percent — and it is hard to keep up with the salaries Amazon is paying in nearby Tracy. ""We have 30 positions open at any given time,"" said Rock Magnan, the company's president. And the desire of companies to rely on robots isn't abating. FedEx is already exploring the use of robotics in the concrete yards outside its hubs, where workers move freight with forklifts and other vehicles, Mr. Dengel said. On the second floor of the North Carolina hub, where most packages race down conveyor belts, the company is preparing to install a system that can automatically recognize packages that need special handling. In the past, that also required a paid worker. After testing five Vecna robots over the past several months, FedEx said it will begin testing 20 more with an eye toward replacing all the existing tuggers. It may then expand the program into other hubs across the country. DHL has reached a similar point, after putting mobile robots from two start-ups, Locus and Fetch, into two small parts of its worldwide operations. With a six-year head start, Amazon is much further along. Mr. Clark said the company has deployed more than 100,000 Kiva robots across 26 distribution centers in the United States, Canada, Europe and Japan. And about 30 robotic arms, built by outside companies, are helping to lift and stow standard containers in a handful of facilities. But even inside Amazon, the need for human labor is growing much faster than the robot work force. Since acquiring Kiva and deploying its first robots, Amazon has expanded its work force by 300,000 people. ""The biggest problem is not having enough people and I don't think that is going to change,"" Mr. Clark said."

1,2018-03-19," In 2014, Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company that would later provide services for Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, reached out with a request on Amazon's ""Mechanical Turk"" platform, an online marketplace where people around the world contract with others to perform various tasks. Cambridge Analytica was looking for people who were American Facebook users. It offered to pay them to download and use a personality quiz app on Facebook called thisisyourdigitallife. About 270,000 people installed the app in return for $1 to $2 per download. The app ""scraped"" information from their Facebook profiles as well as detailed information from their friends' profiles. Facebook then provided all this data to the makers of the app, who in turn turned it over to Cambridge Analytica. A few hundred thousand people may not seem like a lot, but because Facebook users have a few hundred friends each on average, the number of people whose data was harvested reached about 50 million. Most of those people had no idea that their data had been siphoned off (after all, they hadn't installed the app themselves), let alone that the data would be used to shape voter targeting and messaging for Mr. Trump's presidential campaign. This weekend, after this was all exposed by The New York Times and The Observer of London, Facebook hastily made a public announcement that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica (well over a year after the election) and vehemently denied that this was a ""data breach."" Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook, wrote that ""the claim that this is a data breach is completely false."" He contended that Facebook users ""knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked."" He also said that ""everyone involved gave their consent."" Mr. Grewal is right: This wasn't a breach in the technical sense. It is something even more troubling: an all-too-natural consequence of Facebook's business model, which involves having people go to the site for social interaction, only to be quietly subjected to an enormous level of surveillance. The results of that surveillance are used to fuel a sophisticated and opaque system for narrowly targeting advertisements and other wares to Facebook's users. Facebook makes money, in other words, by profiling us and then selling our attention to advertisers, political actors and others. These are Facebook's true customers, whom it works hard to please. Facebook doesn't just record every click and ""like"" on the site. It also collects browsing histories. It also purchases ""external"" data like financial information about users (though European nations have some regulations that block some of this). Facebook recently announced its intent to merge ""offline"" data — things you do in the physical world, such as making purchases in a brick-and-mortar store — with its vast online databases. Facebook even creates ""shadow profiles"" of nonusers. That is, even if you are not on Facebook, the company may well have compiled a profile of you, inferred from data provided by your friends or from other data. This is an involuntary dossier from which you cannot opt out in the United States. Despite Facebook's claims to the contrary, everyone involved in the Cambridge Analytica data-siphoning incident did not give his or her ""consent"" — at least not in any meaningful sense of the word. It is true that if you found and read all the fine print on the site, you might have noticed that in 2014, your Facebook friends had the right to turn over all your data through such apps. (Facebook has since turned off this feature.) If you had managed to make your way through a bewildering array of options, you might have even discovered how to turn the feature off. This wasn't informed consent. This was the exploitation of user data and user trust. Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that you had explicitly consented to turn over your Facebook data to another company. Do you keep up with the latest academic research on computational inference? Did you know that algorithms now do a pretty good job of inferring a person's personality traits, sexual orientation, political views, mental health status, substance abuse history and more just from his or her Facebook ""likes"" — and that there are new applications of this data being discovered every day? Given this confusing and rapidly changing state of affairs about what the data may reveal and how it may be used, consent to ongoing and extensive data collection can be neither fully informed nor truly consensual — especially since it is practically irrevocable. What did Cambridge Analytica do with all the data? With whom else might it have shared it? In 2015, Facebook sent a stern letter to Cambridge Analytica asking that the data be deleted. Cambridge Analytica employees have said that the company merely checked a box indicating that the data was deleted, at which point Facebook decided not to inform the 50 million users who were affected by the breach, nor to make the issue public, nor to sanction Cambridge Analytica at the time. The New York Times and The Observer of London are reporting that the data was not deleted. And Cambridge Analytica employees are claiming that the data formed the backbone of the company's operations in the 2016 presidential election. If Facebook failed to understand that this data could be used in dangerous ways, that it shouldn't have let anyone harvest data in this manner and that a third-party ticking a box on a form wouldn't free the company from responsibility, it had no business collecting anyone's data in the first place. But the vast infrastructure Facebook has built to obtain data, and its consequent half-a-trillion-dollar market capitalization, suggest that the company knows all too well the value of this kind of vast data surveillance. Should we all just leave Facebook? That may sound attractive but it is not a viable solution. In many countries, Facebook and its products simply are the internet. Some employers and landlords demand to see Facebook profiles, and there are increasingly vast swaths of public and civic life — from volunteer groups to political campaigns to marches and protests — that are accessible or organized only via Facebook. The problem here goes beyond Cambridge Analytica and what it may have done. What other apps were allowed to siphon data from millions of Facebook users? What if one day Facebook decides to suspend from its site a presidential campaign or a politician whose platform calls for things like increased data privacy for individuals and limits on data retention and use? What if it decides to share data with one political campaign and not another? What if it gives better ad rates to candidates who align with its own interests? A business model based on vast data surveillance and charging clients to opaquely target users based on this kind of extensive profiling will inevitably be misused. The real problem is that billions of dollars are being made at the expense of the health of our public sphere and our politics, and crucial decisions are being made unilaterally, and without recourse or accountability."

About 270,000 people installed the app in return for $1 to $2 per download. The app ""scraped"" information from their Facebook profiles as well as detailed information from their friends' profiles. Facebook then provided all this data to the makers of the app, who in turn turned it over to Cambridge Analytica. A few hundred thousand people may not seem like a lot, but because Facebook users have a few hundred friends each on average, the number of people whose data was harvested reached about 50 million. Most of those people had no idea that their data had been siphoned off (after all, they hadn't installed the app themselves), let alone that the data would be used to shape voter targeting and messaging for Mr. Trump's presidential campaign. This weekend, after this was all exposed by The New York Times and The Observer of London, Facebook hastily made a public announcement that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica (well over a year after the election) and vehemently denied that this was a ""data breach."" Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook, wrote that ""the claim that this is a data breach is completely false."" He contended that Facebook users ""knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked."" He also said that ""everyone involved gave their consent."" Mr. Grewal is right: This wasn't a breach in the technical sense. It is something even more troubling: an all-too-natural consequence of Facebook's business model, which involves having people go to the site for social interaction, only to be quietly subjected to an enormous level of surveillance. The results of that surveillance are used to fuel a sophisticated and opaque system for narrowly targeting advertisements and other wares to Facebook's users. Facebook makes money, in other words, by profiling us and then selling our attention to advertisers, political actors and others. These are Facebook's true customers, whom it works hard to please. Facebook doesn't just record every click and ""like"" on the site. It also collects browsing histories. It also purchases ""external"" data like financial information about users (though European nations have some regulations that block some of this). Facebook recently announced its intent to merge ""offline"" data — things you do in the physical world, such as making purchases in a brick-and-mortar store — with its vast online databases. Facebook even creates ""shadow profiles"" of nonusers. That is, even if you are not on Facebook, the company may well have compiled a profile of you, inferred from data provided by your friends or from other data. This is an involuntary dossier from which you cannot opt out in the United States. Despite Facebook's claims to the contrary, everyone involved in the Cambridge Analytica data-siphoning incident did not give his or her ""consent"" — at least not in any meaningful sense of the word. It is true that if you found and read all the fine print on the site, you might have noticed that in 2014, your Facebook friends had the right to turn over all your data through such apps. (Facebook has since turned off this feature.) If you had managed to make your way through a bewildering array of options, you might have even discovered how to turn the feature off. This wasn't informed consent. This was the exploitation of user data and user trust. Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that you had explicitly consented to turn over your Facebook data to another company. Do you keep up with the latest academic research on computational inference? Did you know that algorithms now do a pretty good job of inferring a person's personality traits, sexual orientation, political views, mental health status, substance abuse history and more just from his or her Facebook ""likes"" — and that there are new applications of this data being discovered every day? Given this confusing and rapidly changing state of affairs about what the data may reveal and how it may be used, consent to ongoing and extensive data collection can be neither fully informed nor truly consensual — especially since it is practically irrevocable. What did Cambridge Analytica do with all the data? With whom else might it have shared it? In 2015, Facebook sent a stern letter to Cambridge Analytica asking that the data be deleted. Cambridge Analytica employees have said that the company merely checked a box indicating that the data was deleted, at which point Facebook decided not to inform the 50 million users who were affected by the breach, nor to make the issue public, nor to sanction Cambridge Analytica at the time. The New York Times and The Observer of London are reporting that the data was not deleted. And Cambridge Analytica employees are claiming that the data formed the backbone of the company's operations in the 2016 presidential election. If Facebook failed to understand that this data could be used in dangerous ways, that it shouldn't have let anyone harvest data in this manner and that a third-party ticking a box on a form wouldn't free the company from responsibility, it had no business collecting anyone's data in the first place. But the vast infrastructure Facebook has built to obtain data, and its consequent half-a-trillion-dollar market capitalization, suggest that the company knows all too well the value of this kind of vast data surveillance. Should we all just leave Facebook? That may sound attractive but it is not a viable solution. In many countries, Facebook and its products simply are the internet. Some employers and landlords demand to see Facebook profiles, and there are increasingly vast swaths of public and civic life — from volunteer groups to political campaigns to marches and protests — that are accessible or organized only via Facebook. The problem here goes beyond Cambridge Analytica and what it may have done. What other apps were allowed to siphon data from millions of Facebook users? What if one day Facebook decides to suspend from its site a presidential campaign or a politician whose platform calls for things like increased data privacy for individuals and limits on data retention and use? What if it decides to share data with one political campaign and not another? What if it gives better ad rates to candidates who align with its own interests? A business model based on vast data surveillance and charging clients to opaquely target users based on this kind of extensive profiling will inevitably be misused. The real problem is that billions of dollars are being made at the expense of the health of our public sphere and our politics, and crucial decisions are being made unilaterally, and without recourse or accountability."

But that's not true here,"" said Pablos Holman, a self-described futurist and inventor who has worked on lasers that kill mosquitoes and machines that suppress hurricanes. ""There's geniuses everywhere,"" he said, motioning to the pair talking next to him, the theoretical physicist Lisa Randall and the computer scientist Stephen Wolfram. ""I don't even register on this scale."" We're at Mars, an exclusive three-day conference at a midcentury-modern hotel here in the California desert run by Amazon and its founder, Jeff Bezos, for some of the world's most successful geeks. For its first two years, Mars was largely secret; the most prominent image that leaked was a photo of Mr. Bezos piloting a 13-foot robot last year. This year, Amazon lifted the veil and invited a handful of reporters into Mr. Bezos's brainiac pow-wow.  Amazon is eager to buoy its reputation in artificial intelligence, a focus of the conference, amid tight competition with Google. And Mr. Bezos, who according to Bloomberg is the world's richest person with a roughly $130 billion fortune, is growing more comfortable in the spotlight, particularly as a modern-day Renaissance man. His side projects now include The Washington Post, the space firm Blue Origin and a 10,000-year clock in a West Texas mountain that ticks once a year. For Mars, Amazon and Mr. Bezos handpick the roughly 200 attendees, most from the fields of artificial intelligence, robotics and space. There are astronauts, philosophers, rocket scientists, Nobel prize winners and gravitational-wave astrophysicists. Attendance and everything else — room service, the crab legs at breakfast, seaweed wraps at the spa — were free. (The New York Times paid my way.) Mr. Bezos was visible throughout, sitting front and center at presentations and posing for photos with attendees in front of a Blue Origin space capsule. His booming laugh was easy to pick out in the crowd.  When I arrived at the Parker Palm Springs hotel where the conference was held, three separate conference workers tried to carry my bag. In my room, the lights were dimmed, a cheese plate was waiting, and an Amazon Echo was playing bossa nova. A note said to keep the Echo. (I didn't.) Atop a collection of more high-end swag was a note from Mr. Bezos: ""We'll consider this gathering a big success if you find something inspiring.""  While there were dozens of multimillionaires among the attendees, many savored the luxury. ""This is quite opulent compared to what I'm used to,"" said Ann Karagozian, a rocket scientist from the University of California, Los Angeles. ""Definitely not any academic conferences."" At dinner, seats were preassigned. After dark, free booze flowed from makeshift bars and attendees lit up high-end cigars. Mr. Bezos held court around the fire pit Sunday night, tumbler of whiskey in hand. He wore the down Patagonia jacket given to each guest — a style that has become a sort of tech-industry uniform — with jeans and cowboy boots. One attendee described the get-up as Silicon Valley meets West Texas, where Blue Origin has its main launch site.  Mornings were reserved for show and tell. About a dozen attendees presented on novel businesses or scientific breakthroughs, from new techniques for studying supermassive black holes to computer chips implanted in brains that can resolve symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Rich Mahoney, head of a ""powered-clothing"" start-up called Seismic, showed off leotards with built-in sensors and electric motors to mimic muscles — designed to help elderly or disabled wearers stand from chairs. ""Intelligent, wearable strength,"" he said. ""This is a new clothing paradigm."" There was one clear rock star: A yellow four-legged robot named SpotMini that strutted back and forth on stage as a sea of smartphone cameras focused in. It was the newest invention from Boston Dynamics, the Defense Department-funded firm that Google recently sold to SoftBank. After the presentation, Mr. Bezos and SpotMini led the crowd to lunch.  To get to lunch, attendees passed under a colorful spiked 16-foot plexiglass archway coated in a reflective dichroic film, which was originally designed to protect spacesuits from cosmic radiation — and now costs about $125 per square foot.  ""Four people have proposed to their girlfriends underneath it,"" said Davis McCarty, the Chicago artist who built the gate in 2016 for Burning Man, the arts festival in the Nevada desert.  Throughout, Amazon executives referred to repeat guests as alumni or ""returning campers."" Attendees seemed universally smitten with the conference; some suggested they were a part of history.  Ken Goldberg, a roboticist from the University of California, Berkeley, compared Mars to Athens 2,000 years ago, showing Raphael's fresco ""The School of Athens"" during a presentation. ""People would be hanging out, discussing ideas, having arguments, and a big topic at the time was space,"" he said. ""It's like a true salon of its time,"" said Brogan BamBrogan, an entrepreneur with a walrus mustache who now runs Arrivo, which aims to build high-speed transportation networks using levitating cars in highway medians.  At lunch, Mr. Bezos played beer pong, minus the beer, against a robotic arm. (He lost.) Across the lawn, attendees played a different robotic arm in table tennis, and SpotMini — piloted by a human — mugged for cameras and snatched phones with the arm that extended from its neck.  Some attendees said they were so impressed by the guest list they were unsure they belonged. The serial entrepreneur Dean Kamen, best known for inventing the Segway, said, ""You feel like you're walking around here as an intellectual midget."" In the afternoon, we had a choice of activities, from falconry to Navy Seal training to sausage making. Group meditation was popular. On Tuesday, a collective ""ohhhmmm"" rang out across the hotel grounds.  Eighteen of us, including me, flew aerobatic planes. Most who signed up were eager to hop into the cockpit; a few later had to use the barf bag. Many were paired up for ""dogfights"" in which they chased each other in the sky. We were allowed to steer the plane for periods; the pilot in back also had a hand on the controls. In one dogfight, Takeo Kanade, 72, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and robotics pioneer, vanquished his opponent, Aaron Dollar, 40, an up-and-coming roboticist at Yale.  ""Old-man wisdom won,"" Mr. Kanade said after getting out of the plane, still wearing a flight suit with his pilot call sign for the day Velcroed on: ""Wolfman."" Mr. Dollar's call sign was ""Tinkerbell."" On Tuesday at about 5:45 a.m., more than a dozen attendees gathered on one lawn and craned their necks toward the sky, looking for the Humanity Star, a satellite covered in mirrors that one of them, Peter Beck, had launched into orbit.  The pre-dawn group included Bob Smith, chief executive of Blue Origin, and Adam Savage, co-host of the former Discovery show ""MythBusters."" About 90 seconds after the satellite was supposed to be glittering across the sky, nothing had appeared. Then, for a moment, there was a flash in the sky. ""That was it!"" someone shouted. Then another flash.  ""It reflects the sunlight from the sun and it strobes the earth like a giant disco ball,"" said Mr. Beck, a New Zealander with curly hair who founded the space firm Rocket Lab. ""The point is to really get people to look up and have an overview effect, and realize they're standing on a rock in the middle of the universe."""

0,2018-03-23," Goldman Sachs has already made moves to reach Main Street, including creating a consumer lending company and having its chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, become a minor Twitter celebrity. Now, it is trying to expand the audience of its ""Talks at GS"" interviews — a series of chats with guests ranging from corporate chieftains like Robert A. Iger of the Walt Disney Company to athletes like Magic Johnson and artists like André Aciman, the novelist who wrote ""Call Me By Your Name."" Over the past week, Goldman has begun posting its series to platforms like Hulu, Yahoo Finance, Amazon Prime and Spotify, broadening a reach that already encompassed YouTube and social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. ""Talks at GS"" was not meant to be a take on traditional television talk shows. Instead, it began several years ago as an informal series of interviews with chief executives and other visitors to Goldman's headquarters for the benefit of the firm's employees. The guests were not always clients, either. The first interview was with Barry Scheck of the Innocence Project. ""Internally, there's an interest in giving people a real opportunity to learn from the leaders and thinkers who are shaping the public discourse,"" Elizabeth Bowyer, Goldman's co-head of content strategy, said in an interview. The decision to put the talks online grew out of the reception they have received within the firm, Ms. Bowyer said. (Sessions are often standing-room-only.) Goldman hired a television producer who had worked for Katie Couric for the interviews and to help book guests. Some of the videos have performed well on YouTube, even if they do not challenge the platform's top stars for views. An interview with Bryan Fogel, the filmmaker behind the Russian-doping documentary ""Icarus,"" has garnered about 277,000 views. And one with Alex Blumberg of the Gimlet podcast network and Jacob Weisberg of the Slate Group has collected roughly 197,000 views. The videos do not generate any revenue for the firm, but they do serve in some ways as a branding exercise for Goldman, making the firm seem more accessible, Ms. Bowyer said. The chats often grow out of the personal interests of Goldman executives. It was Mr. Blankfein, a history buff, who proposed bringing in Ron Chernow, the historian and the author of the Alexander Hamilton biography that inspired ""Hamilton,"" to talk about his new biography of Ulysses S. Grant. What emerged was a 46-minute conversation (with 312,000 views) that touched on both Broadway and race relations in the United States. Tim Urban, the writer behind the popular ""Wait But Why"" website, was brought in for a chat at the suggestion of a junior banker. His interview has collected 137,000 views on YouTube.

0,2018-03-25," When Amazon agreed last year to begin collecting sales tax in New Mexico, state officials celebrated what they said could be tens of millions of dollars in annual tax revenue. But they aren't cheering in Albuquerque City Hall. A year after that announcement, New Mexico's largest city hasn't seen a dime from Amazon. That's because the online shopping giant's deal applied only to the 5.125 percent statewide tax, not to the 2.375 percent tax tacked on by the City of Albuquerque. ""The loser in that arrangement is cities,"" Mayor Tim Keller said. ""Cities are really being left to themselves."" Thanks in part to a series of deals with state governments in recent years, Amazon is collecting sales tax in every state that has one. But those deals don't always extend to taxes assessed by local governments. The company still isn't collecting sales taxes in dozens of cities, including Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Cedar Rapids, Iowa, according to a new report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning think tank. Carl Davis, the report's author, said local governments were missing out on millions in tax revenue when other income streams are also under strain. And local retailers, many already struggling to compete with online retailers, are effectively forced to charge more for their products than online sellers that aren't required to collect local taxes. ""It's just a direct price advantage that shows up on customers' receipts,"" Mr. Davis said. ""You never want to end up in the situation where the companies you're offering better deals to are the ones that don't even have roots in your community."" Amazon says it collects taxes in every jurisdiction where it is required to do so, and Mr. Davis's report found that the company does collect local taxes in most states. But a hodgepodge of state laws govern tax collection, meaning there isn't a simple solution for municipalities that are now left out. For example, sales tax rules based on the location of the seller may be impossible to enforce if the company has no physical presence in that jurisdiction. And smaller online retailers can escape collecting sales taxes in more places than Amazon does — even when they use Amazon to sell their products. Amazon is facing increasing scrutiny over its tax policies. Despite being one of the largest retailers in the country by revenue, Amazon pays relatively little in federal income tax, largely because of its low profit margins. Until several years ago, Amazon also collected little in state sales taxes, and in most states still does not collect taxes on goods sold on its platform by third parties. (Amazon collects taxes on such third-party sales in Washington State, and agreed this month to begin doing so in Pennsylvania.) The company has also faced criticism for requesting tax incentives from state and local governments to lure Amazon facilities, including its planned second headquarters. Mr. Davis, however, said his findings were less the fault of Amazon than of state tax systems that don't require, and in some cases don't allow, online retailers to collect local taxes. He said states rushed to strike deals with Amazon without always ensuring that local governments would benefit as well. ""It's just been overshadowed by the state issue,"" Mr. Davis said. ""It's smaller dollars at play, but for these communities, it's dollars that matter."" Amazon sometimes collects taxes where other online retailers do not. In Chicago, for example, Amazon collects local taxes because it has warehouses and other facilities in Illinois; online retailers that don't have a physical presence in the state generally don't have to collect taxes there. Usually it is states — not cities or counties — that decide who has to collect local sales taxes. In most states, taxes are based on the location of the buyer, and retailers are required to collect local sales taxes alongside state taxes. But in some states, including New Mexico, taxes are based on the location of the seller, meaning there is no mechanism for collecting taxes from sellers that don't have a physical presence in the area. Other states have other legal quirks that affect local tax collections. Those loopholes have existed for years, but their significance has grown greatly with the rise of online retail, said Scott Peterson, vice president of government relations as Avalara, a company that helps retailers calculate and collect sales taxes. ""This huge hole that exists in the sales tax structure has been known for a long time,"" Mr. Peterson said. ""Their laws have not kept up."" A pending Supreme Court case, South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., could change the legal landscape, but not necessarily simplify it. Depending on the outcome, the case could pave the way for states to require companies to collect sales taxes even if they don't have a location in the state. But local governments in Pennsylvania, New Mexico and other states still wouldn't be able to collect taxes without help from their legislatures. Local government officials in many parts of the country say the rise of tax-free online shopping has had a big impact on their budgets. Albuquerque, for example, relies on the sales tax — or what is known in New Mexico as a gross receipts tax — for nearly two-thirds of its general fund revenue, which totaled about $500 million last year. The city's finance department estimates that it lost out on $5 million in tax revenue on Amazon purchases in 2016, although calculations are difficult because of a lack of available data. Lost revenue from other online retailers adds millions of dollars more. Mr. Keller, the mayor, said Amazon benefited from city services, such as the roads used by delivery trucks carrying its packages and the police officers who makes sure packages aren't stolen. But unlike local retailers, the company doesn't chip in. ""This is the fundamental way we fund American society, and thanks to technology they found a way to opt out of that,"" Mr. Keller said. ""They're getting a free ride."" For businesses, the practical effect of that free ride is probably small, at least outside of a handful of high-tax jurisdictions. Local sales taxes add just 1 or 2 percent to prices in most cities, not enough to sway most shoppers' decisions. But retailers said the tax was a matter of fairness: Why should local businesses be at a disadvantage, however small, against a much larger, out-of-town rival? ""The 2 percent doesn't drive someone from my place to Amazon, but it doesn't help,"" said Richard de Wyngaert, owner of Head House Books, an independent bookstore in Philadelphia. ""I just feel that if not all businesses, why any business? If we don't all pay taxes, why should any of us? To me, it's ludicrous. There is a social contract with your citizens."" Candelora Versace, who with her husband runs a custom jewelry shop in Santa Fe, N.M., said that her customers frequently buy gemstones online, then come into the store to have them put into settings. She said that she doubted they were explicitly trying to avoid paying Santa Fe's roughly 3 percent sales, but that regardless of their intent, the effect on the community was the same. ""The roads don't pay themselves. The schools don't fund themselves,"" Ms. Versace said. ""When they don't want to pay the tax, it cheats us. It cheats those of us who live here and have businesses here."""
0,2018-03-30," To the Editor: Re ""In President's Tirade on Amazon, the Rage Might Be for the C.E.O."" (front page, March 30): President Trump has singled out Amazon, saying it doesn't pay enough in taxes, for one reason: Jeff Bezos, its founder, owns The Washington Post, and The Post has been critical of the president and his administration. As such, it is a serious attack on freedom of the press. There are many ways to undermine a free press, and the president's actions in regard to Amazon are particularly devious and dangerous to our democracy. M.A. FEIRSTEIN, NEW YORK To the Editor: Wasn't it President Trump himself who said that not paying taxes was a sign of being smart? BILL SCHULTZ, ATLANTA"
1,2018-03-30," SAN FRANCISCO — Two days after Donald J. Trump won the 2016 election, executives at Google consoled their employees in an all-staff meeting broadcast around the world. ""There is a lot of fear within Google,"" said Sundar Pichai, the company's chief executive, according to a video of the meeting viewed by The New York Times. When asked by an employee if there was any silver lining to Mr. Trump's election, the Google co-founder Sergey Brin said, ""Boy, that's a really tough one right now."" Ruth Porat, the finance chief, said Mr. Trump's victory felt ""like a ton of bricks dropped on my chest."" Then she instructed members of the audience to hug the person next to them. Sixteen months later, Google's parent company, Alphabet, has most likely saved billions of dollars in taxes on its overseas cash under a new tax law signed by Mr. Trump. Alphabet also stands to benefit from the Trump administration's looser regulations for self-driving cars and delivery drones, as well as from proposed changes to the trade pact with Mexico and Canada that would limit Google's liability for user content on its sites. Once one of Mr. Trump's most vocal opponents, Silicon Valley's technology industry has increasingly found common ground with the White House. When Mr. Trump was elected, tech executives were largely up in arms over a leader who espoused policies on immigration and other issues that were antithetical to their companies' values. Now, many of the industry's executives are growing more comfortable with the president and how his economic agenda furthers their business interests, even as many of their employees continue to disagree with Mr. Trump on social issues. The relationship remains bumpy. Mr. Trump lashed out at Amazon on Twitter on Thursday, accusing the e-commerce giant of evading taxes. (Amazon said it had saved $789 million under the tax law Mr. Trump signed.) The president is also expected to sign legislation,  passed by the Senate last week, that would strengthen policing of sex trafficking online — a bill that internet companies once opposed because they worried it would make them liable for content posted by their users. Yet quietly, the tech industry has warmed to the White House, especially as companies including Alphabet, Apple and Intel have benefited from the Trump administration's policies. Those include lowering corporate taxes, encouraging development of new wireless technology like 5G and, so far, ignoring calls to break up the tech giants. Mr. Trump's tougher stance on China may also help ward off industry rivals, with the president squashing a hostile bid to acquire the chip maker Qualcomm this month. And Mr. Trump let die an Obama-era rule that required many tech start-ups to give some workers more overtime pay. Mr. Trump ""has been great for business and really, really good for tech,"" said Gary Shapiro, who leads the Consumer Technology Association, the largest American tech trade group, with more than 2,200 members including Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook. Mr. Shapiro said that he had voted for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump's opponent, in 2016, but that he and many tech executives had come around on Mr. Trump. While they disagree with him on immigration and the environment, they have found areas where their interests align, like deregulation and investment in internet infrastructure. ""This isn't Hitler or Mussolini here,"" Mr. Shapiro said. And even though the president's new tariffs on steel and aluminum could hurt American businesses and consumers, ""disagreement in one area does not mean we cannot work together in others,"" Mr. Shapiro said. ""Everyone who is married knows that."" Mr. Trump himself has taken to naming tech companies he says are on his side. After Apple took advantage of the new tax law in January to bring back most of the $252 billion cash hoard that it had parked overseas, the company said it would make a $350 billion ""contribution to the U.S. economy"" over the next five years. That prompted Mr. Trump to suggest he had made good on a campaign pledge to get Apple to bring jobs back to the United States. ""You know, for $350 million, you could build a beautiful plant. But for $350 billion, they're going to build a lot of plants,"" the president told members of Congress last month. Mr. Trump said he had called Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, to personally thank him. In fact, Apple has no plans to build a plant in the United States. The company is uneasy with Mr. Trump's invoking it to signify how his policies are working, according to a person close to Apple who was not authorized to speak publicly. Apple has not, however, publicly corrected the president. Mr. Trump has also stayed quiet on the controversy engulfing Facebook over user privacy, while other politicians have called for more regulations after revelations that the British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested the information of 50 million Facebook users. Cambridge Analytica used that data to aid Mr. Trump's campaign. Michael Kratsios, the White House's deputy chief technology officer, said in an interview that while Mr. Trump and Silicon Valley had their differences, ""in places where we do see eye to eye, I think we're achieving extraordinary success."" Dean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, a 102-year-old advocacy group that represents the biggest tech firms, said his members walked a tightrope, supporting and opposing the president on different issues. Lately, he said, ""we have reached balance in the tightrope."" The equilibrium marks a turnabout from what had been a testy relationship between Mr. Trump and the tech sector. On the campaign trail in 2016, Mr. Trump was so critical of tech companies that Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, once joked he might send Mr. Trump to space in a rocket. Some tech executives have since disagreed with Mr. Trump on social issues. Mr. Cook emailed staff last June to say he had unsuccessfully lobbied the president to remain in the Paris climate accords. In November, Microsoft sued the administration to protect a law that blocks deportation of young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers. More than 100 companies, including Google, Facebook and Uber, filed a brief supporting California's lawsuit on that issue. Even so, tech executives worked to build a relationship with the president, with some meeting him at Trump Tower before his inauguration and again at the White House in June. While in Washington for the second meeting, Mr. Cook and Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, also dined with Jared Kushner, the president's senior adviser and son-in-law, and Ivanka Trump at the couple's Washington home, according to a person briefed on the meeting who wasn't authorized to speak publicly about it. This month, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin visited Apple's headquarters. Silicon Valley has found plenty to like about the Trump presidency. In September, tech giants including Facebook and Microsoft teamed up with the administration to pledge $500 million to computer science education. Amazon, Microsoft and Google are also eyeing the administration as a potential customer as Mr. Trump pushes to modernize the government's digital infrastructure. But Silicon Valley's favorite thing about Mr. Trump is almost certainly his new tax code. Many tech companies lobbied for corporate tax reform for years before Mr. Trump signed the new tax bill. Tech giants immediately reaped the benefits. Under the new rules, Apple saved $43.7 billion in taxes, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan research group. Apple then announced the $350 billion ""contribution"" to the economy over five years. Most of the tally was previously planned spending with American suppliers and a $38 billion tax payment on its overseas cash. But Apple also said it planned to hire 20,000 new workers, invest in new data centers and another domestic campus, and increase a fund for innovative American manufacturers to $5 billion from $1 billion. It also gave employees $2,500 bonuses. The president was quick to tweet the news. The shifting relationship between Silicon Valley and Mr. Trump appears to have upset some tech employees. A Facebook page called ""Angry Googler,"" with nearly 1,000 followers, has been dedicated to criticizing Google for any sign it was cooperating with the president. ""Not happy about Google pulling a 180 and jumping into bed with Trump? Same here,"" said the ""About"" section of the page, which suggests it is run by a Google employee. This month, the page posted an article about Google helping the Defense Department analyze drone footage. ""We've gone from organizing the world's information to … optimizing weapons of war,"" the page said. Messages to the account were not returned. Google declined to comment. Some tech firms remain discomfited about appearing as the president's allies. Last month, Rob Goldman, Facebook's vice president of advertising, played down Russia's impact on the 2016 election after the Justice Department charged 13 Russians with trying to subvert its outcome, including by using Facebook. Mr. Trump retweeted Mr. Goldman approvingly. Facebook was uncomfortable with that association with the president, said a person close to the company who was not authorized to speak publicly. Two days later, Facebook's policy chief, Joel Kaplan, distanced the company from Mr. Goldman's comments. ""The special counsel has issued its indictments, and nothing we found contradicts their conclusions,"" he said in a statement. ""Any suggestion otherwise is wrong."""
0,2018-03-31," Amazon ran a commercial on this year's Super Bowl that pretended its digital assistant Alexa had temporarily lost her voice. It featured celebrities like Rebel Wilson, Cardi B and even the company's chief executive, Jeff Bezos. While the ad riffed on what Alexa can say to users, the more intriguing question may be what she and other digital assistants can hear — especially as more people bring smart speakers into their homes. Amazon and Google, the leading sellers of such devices, say the assistants record and process audio only after users trigger them by pushing a button or uttering a phrase like ""Hey, Alexa"" or ""O.K., Google."" But each company has filed patent applications, many of them still under consideration, that outline an array of possibilities for how devices like these could monitor more of what users say and do. That information could then be used to identify a person's desires or interests, which could be mined for ads and product recommendations. In one set of patent applications, Amazon describes how a ""voice sniffer algorithm"" could be used on an array of devices, like tablets and e-book readers, to analyze audio almost in real time when it hears words like ""love,"" bought"" or ""dislike."" A diagram included with the application illustrated how a phone call between two friends could result in one receiving an offer for the San Diego Zoo and the other seeing an ad for a Wine of the Month Club membership. Some patent applications from Google, which also owns the smart home product maker Nest Labs, describe how audio and visual signals could be used in the context of elaborate smart home setups. One application details how audio monitoring could help detect that a child is engaging in ""mischief"" at home by first using speech patterns and pitch to identify a child's presence, one filing said. A device could then try to sense movement while listening for whispers or silence, and even program a smart speaker to ""provide a verbal warning."" A separate application regarding personalizing content for people while respecting their privacy noted that voices could be used to determine a speaker's mood using the ""volume of the user's voice, detected breathing rate, crying and so forth,"" and medical condition ""based on detected coughing, sneezing and so forth."" The same application outlines how a device could ""recognize a T-shirt on a floor of the user's closet"" bearing Will Smith's face and combine that with a browser history that shows searches for Mr. Smith ""to provide a movie recommendation that displays, 'You seem to like Will Smith. His new movie is playing in a theater near you.'"" In a statement, Amazon said the company took ""privacy seriously"" and did ""not use customers' voice recordings for targeted advertising."" Amazon said that it filed ""a number of forward-looking patent applications that explore the full possibilities of new technology,"" and that they ""take multiple years to receive and do not necessarily reflect current developments to products and services."" Google said it did not ""use raw audio to extrapolate moods, medical conditions or demographic information."" The company added, ""All devices that come with the Google Assistant, including Google Home, are designed with user privacy in mind."" Tech companies apply for a dizzying number of patents every year, many of which are never used and are years from even being possible. Still, Jamie Court, the president of Consumer Watchdog, a nonprofit advocacy group in Santa Monica, Calif., which published a study of some of the patent applications in December, said, ""When you read parts of the applications, it's really clear that this is spyware and a surveillance system meant to serve you up to advertisers."" The companies, Mr. Court added, are ""basically going to be finding out what our home life is like in qualitative ways."" Google called Consumer Watchdog's claims ""unfounded,"" and said, ""Prospective product announcements should not necessarily be inferred from our patent applications."" A recent Gallup poll found that 22 percent of Americans used devices like Google Home or Amazon Echo. The growing adoption of smart speakers means that gadgets, some of which contain up to eight microphones and a camera, are being placed in kitchens and bedrooms and used to answer questions, control appliances and make phone calls. Apple recently introduced its own version, called the HomePod. But many consumers are also becoming increasingly nervous that tech companies are eavesdropping on them in order to serve them targeted ads, no matter how often the companies deny it. The recent revelations that a British political data firm, Cambridge Analytica, improperly harvested the information of 50 million Facebook users has only added to the public's wariness over the collection and use of personal information. Facebook, in fact, had planned to unveil its new internet-connected home products at a developer conference in May, according to Bloomberg News, which reported that the company had scuttled that idea partly in response to the recent fallout. Both Amazon and Google have emphasized that devices with Alexa and Google Assistant store voice recordings from users only after they are intentionally triggered. Amazon's Echo and its newer smart speakers with screens use lights to show when they are streaming audio to the cloud, and consumers can view and delete their recordings on the Alexa smartphone app or on Amazon's website (though they are warned online that ""may degrade"" their experience). Google Home also has a light that indicates when it is recording, and users can similarly see and delete that audio online. Amazon says voice recordings may help fulfill requests and improve its services, while Google says the data helps it learn over time to provide better, more personalized responses. But the ecosystem around voice data is still evolving. Take the thousands of third-party apps developed for Alexa called ""skills,"" which can be used to play games, dim lights or provide cleaning advice. While Amazon said it didn't share users' actual recordings with third parties, its terms of use for Alexa say it may share the content of their requests or information like their ZIP codes. Google says it will ""generally"" not provide audio recordings to third-party service providers, but may send transcriptions of what people say. And some devices have already shown that they are capable of recording more than what users expect. Google faced some embarrassment last fall when a batch of Google Home Minis that it distributed at company events and to journalists were almost constantly recording. In a starker example, detectives investigating a death at an Arkansas home sought access to audio on an Echo device in 2016. Amazon resisted, but the recordings were ultimately shared with the permission of the defendant, James Bates. (A judge later dismissed Mr. Bates's first-degree murder charge based on separate evidence.) Kathleen Zellner, his lawyer, said in an interview that the Echo had been recording more than it was supposed to. Mr. Bates told her that it had been regularly lighting up without being prompted, and had logged conversations that were unrelated to Alexa commands, including a conversation about football in a separate room, she said. ""It was just extremely sloppy the way the activation occurred,"" Ms. Zellner said. The Electronic Privacy Information Center has recommended more robust disclosure rules for internet-connected devices, including an ""algorithmic transparency requirement"" that would help people understand how their data was being used and what automated decisions were then being made about them. Sam Lester, the center's consumer privacy fellow, said he believed that the abilities of new smart home devices highlighted the need for United States regulators to get more involved with how consumer data was collected and used. ""A lot of these technological innovations can be very good for consumers,"" he said. ""But it's not the responsibility of consumers to protect themselves from these products any more than it's their responsibility to protect themselves from the safety risks in food and drugs. It's why we established a Food and Drug Administration years ago."""
0,2018-04-01," SEATTLE — To see what it's like inside stores where sensors and artificial intelligence have replaced cashiers, shoppers have to trek to Amazon Go, the internet retailer's experimental convenience shop in downtown Seattle. Soon, though, more technology-driven businesses like Amazon Go may be coming to them. A global race to automate stores is underway among several of the world's top retailers and small tech start-ups, which are motivated to shave labor costs and minimize shoppers' frustrations, like waiting for cashiers. They are also trying to prevent Amazon from dominating the physical retail world as it does online shopping. Companies are testing robots that help keep shelves stocked, as well as apps that let shoppers ring up items with a smartphone. High-tech systems like the one used by Amazon Go completely automate the checkout process. China, which has its own ambitious e-commerce companies, is emerging as an especially fertile place for these retail experiments. If they succeed, these new technologies could add further uncertainty to the retail work force, which is already in flux because of the growth of online shopping. An analysis last year by the World Economic Forum said 30 to 50 percent of the world's retail jobs could be at risk once technologies like automated checkout were fully embraced. In addition, the efforts have raised concerns among privacy researchers because of the mounds of data that retailers will be able to gather about shopper behavior as they digitize their locations. Inside Amazon Go, for instance, the cameras never lose sight of a customer once he or she enters the shop. Retailers had adopted technologies in their stores long before Amazon Go arrived on the scene. Self-checkout kiosks have been common in supermarkets and other stores for years. Kroger, the grocery chain, uses sensors and predictive analytics tools to better anticipate when more cashiers will be needed. But the opening of Amazon Go in January was alarming for many retailers, who saw a sudden willingness by Amazon to wield its technology power in new ways. Hundreds of cameras near the ceiling and sensors in the shelves help automatically tally the cookies, chips and soda that shoppers remove and put into their bags. Shoppers' accounts are charged as they walk out the doors. Amazon is now looking to expand Go to new areas. An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment on its expansion plans, but the company  has a job posting for a senior real estate manager who will be responsible for ""site selection and acquisition"" and field tours of ""potential locations"" for new Go stores. ""Unanimously, there was an element of embarrassment because here is an online retailer showing us how to do brick and mortar, and frankly doing it amazingly well,"" said Martin Hitch, the chief business officer of Bossa Nova Robotics, a company that makes inventory management robots that Walmart and others are testing. Nowhere are retailers experimenting more avidly with automating store shopping than in China, a country obsessed by new tech fads. One effort is a chain of more than 100 unmanned convenience shops from a start-up called Bingo Box, one of which sits in a business park in Shanghai. Shoppers scan a code on their phones to enter and, once inside, scan the items they want to buy. The store unlocks the exit door after they've paid through their phones. Alibaba, one of China's largest internet companies, has opened 35 of its Hema automated grocery stores, which blend online ordering with automated checkout. Customers scan their groceries at checkout kiosks, using facial recognition to pay electronically, while bags of groceries ordered by customers online float overhead on aerial conveyors, headed to a loading dock for delivery to shoppers. Not to be outdone, JD, another big internet retailer in China, said in December that it had teamed up with a developer to build hundreds of its own unmanned convenience shops. The businesses put readable chips on items to automate the checkout process. At its huge campus south of Beijing, JD is testing a new store that relies on computer vision and sensors on the shelves to know when items have been taken. The system tracks shopping without tagging products with chips. Payment, which for now still happens at a kiosk, is done with facial recognition. JD and Alibaba both plan to sell their systems to other retailers and are working on additional checkout technologies. Back in the United States, Walmart, the world's largest retailer, is testing out the Bossa Nova robots in dozens of its locations to reduce some tedious tasks that can eat up a worker's time. The robots, which look like giant wheeled luggage bags, roll up and down the aisles looking for shelves where cereal boxes are out of stock and items like toys are mislabeled. The machines then report back to workers, who restock the shelves and apply new labels. At 120 of Walmart's 4,700 American stores, shoppers can also scan items, including fruits and vegetables, using the camera on their smartphones and pay for them using the devices. When customers walk out, an employee checks their receipts and does a ""spot check"" of the items they bought. Kroger, one of the country's largest grocery chains, has also been testing a mobile scanning service in its supermarkets, recently announcing that it would expand it to 400 of its more 2,700 stores. New start-ups are seeking to give retailers the technology to compete with Amazon's system. One of them, AiFi, is working on cashierless checkout technology that it says will be flexible and affordable enough that mom-and-pop retailers and bigger outlets can use it. In the United States, venture capitalists put $100 million into retail automation start-ups in each of the past two years, up from about $64 million in 2015, according Pitchbook, a financial data firm. ""There's a gold rush feeling about this,"" said Alan O'Herlihy, chief executive of Everseen, an Irish company working with retailers on automated checkout technology that uses artificial intelligence. While such technologies could improve the shopping experience, there may also be consequences that people find less desirable. Retailers like Amazon could compile reams of data about where customers spend time inside their doors, comparable to what internet companies already know about their online habits. ""It's combined with everything else Amazon might know about you,"" said Gennie Gebhart, a researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an online civil liberties organization. ""Amazon knows what I buy online, what I watch and now how I move around a space."" In China, there is less public concern about data privacy issues. Many Chinese citizens have become accustomed to high levels of surveillance, including widespread security cameras and government monitoring of online communications. Depending on how heavily retailers automate in the years to come, job losses could be severe in a sector that has already experienced wave after wave of store closings by the likes of Macy's, Toys ""R"" Us and Sears. Retailers are playing down the threat to jobs. Walmart, the largest private employer in the United States, says that it does not anticipate automation will lead to job losses, but rather that the new technologies are meant to redirect employees to spend more time helping customers find what they need. ""We see this as helping our associates,"" said John Crecelius, vice president of central operations at Walmart. ""We are a people-led business that is technology enabled."" Some traditional retailers are also skeptical about whether the sort of automation in Amazon Go can move to large stores. They say the technology may not work or be cost effective outside a store with a small footprint and inventory. ""That's probably not scalable to a 120,000-square-foot store,"" said Chris Hjelm, executive vice president and chief information officer at Kroger. But he said it was just a matter of time before more cameras and sensors were commonplace in stores. ""It's a few years out,"" he said, ""before that technology becomes mainstream."""
1,2018-04-01," SAN FRANCISCO — Ryan Knight, a Democratic activist in Los Angeles, called for a boycott of Apple in February because it hadn't responded to calls to delete a channel from the National Rifle Association from its streaming-video service after the Parkland, Fla., school shooting. ""Dear @Apple,"" Mr. Knight wrote on Twitter. ""Your silence is deafening. #BoycottApple."" More than 330 accounts retweeted the message. How did Mr. Knight post the message? He used an iPhone. As the reach and influence of Silicon Valley's tech giants have increased, so have the calls to boycott their products and services. The problem is that pulling off a boycott is not exactly easy: The tech companies' products are so pervasive that they are difficult to avoid. That issue was crystallized in recent weeks with Facebook. Hundreds of people deleted their accounts after revelations that the political-data firm Cambridge Analytica had improperly harvested the information of 50 million Facebook users. Yet many of those same people promptly instructed their friends to find them on Instagram, which is owned by — you guessed it — Facebook. ""It's exactly the same company. I realize it's ridiculous,"" said Sachi Cunningham, a documentary filmmaker in San Francisco who deactivated her Facebook last week and shifted her attention to Instagram, where, she said, the conversation is less toxic. Ms. Cunningham, who has freelanced for The New York Times, added that she had immediately begun missing Facebook as a research tool for her documentaries. ""I don't know if I can get out of the ecosystem,"" she said. People looking to punish major tech companies by abstaining from their products have been bedeviled time and again by the difficulty in escaping them. After Google fired an engineer, James Damore, for criticizing the company's diversity efforts last year, hundreds of people on social media called for a boycott of the company. But an analysis of nearly 7,000 tweets using the hashtag #BoycottGoogle since August showed that 26 percent of the tweets came from devices using Google's Android software, according to Keyhole, a social-media research firm. One Twitter account named Milton Prescott tweeted on Aug. 8: ""Google's firing of James Damore proves his point completely. I will no longer be using Google for any services. #BoycottGoogle."" The tweet came from an Android device. A message to the account went unreturned. Even Breitbart is running into the same dilemma. The conservative website is planning to host a panel on how tech platforms like Facebook suppress conservative voices — and it said it would livestream the discussion on Facebook. Breitbart didn't respond to a request for comment. Marisa Richardson, a program manager at a life-sciences company, said she began boycotting Amazon recently after learning that it offered the NRA channel on its streaming-video service. So when she needed laundry detergent, she avoided the e-commerce site and instead braved the crowds and traffic — and spent a few dollars more — at a nearby Target. But a few days later she shopped at the Whole Foods near her home in Oakland, Calif. ""I completely forgot that they're owned by Amazon,"" she said. After the shooting in Parkland in February, gun-control activists called for a boycott of certain Apple and Amazon services because they hosted the NRA channel. People used the hashtag #March1NRABoycott to spread the message on social media. An analysis of about 58,500 tweets with the hashtag showed that nearly half came from an iPhone or an iPad, according to Keyhole. Those included popular tweets using the #March1NRABoycott hashtag from the actress Alyssa Milano. ""Had I sent the same tweets from an Android phone, the same issue would apply. There is an NRATV app for Android phones,"" Ms. Milano said through a spokeswoman. ""We are only just beginning to understand how these companies have infiltrated not only our ideologies, but also our lives in the most in-depth way imaginable."" Nearly a third of the 4,700 tweets using the #BoycottApple hashtag since August came from iPhones, according to Keyhole. ""I do have an iPhone, but as a customer of Apple's, am I not allowed to hold them accountable?"" Mr. Knight, the activist who used an iPhone to call for an Apple boycott, said in an interview. Eddy Cue, a senior executive at Apple, recently said that the NRA channel didn't violate the company's policies. Facebook, Google and Amazon didn't respond to requests for comment. Many of those who recently abandoned their Facebook accounts are still in the company's orbit, not only with Instagram but also with the company's popular messaging apps WhatsApp and Messenger. When Cher recently deleted her Facebook page, she said on Twitter, ""2day I did something VERY HARD 4 me."" But her Instagram account, with 768,000 followers, was still active. Likewise, Elon Musk, chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla, deleted the Facebook pages of both companies — but left their pages and his personal account active on Instagram. The photo-sharing platform, he said on Twitter, is fine ""so long as it stays fairly independent."" Stephen Cox, 39, a woodworker in Los Angeles, recently posted on Facebook that he was deactivating his account in favor of Instagram. When someone commented that the two sites were owned by the same company, he replied, ""It's a double-edged sword, but for me one edge is slightly more blunt than the other."" Instagram has proved an effective hedge for Facebook against people losing interest or trust in its main site. While the percentage of American adults who use Facebook has remained flat at 68 percent since 2016, according to a January survey of 2,002 American adults by the Pew Research Center, Instagram use rose to 35 percent from 28 percent over that period. Instagram is also more popular with younger people than older people, according to the survey. Rayven Bruzzese, 26, a sign-language student in Philadelphia, said she had been a frequent user of Facebook for years but deleted her account in March because she found it upsetting and a drain on her time. Now she spends her time on Instagram. While she acknowledged the irony of moving to another Facebook-owned service, she said her options were limited. Few of her friends are on Twitter, and many have stopped using Snapchat. ""Where am I supposed to go?"" she said. ""I wish there was something else."""
0,2018-04-02," In 2009, Turkey's tax ministry imposed a $2.5 billion fine for alleged tax evasion on Dogan Yayin, a media conglomerate whose newspapers and television stations were critical of the Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Under financial and political pressure, the company began unloading some assets and closing others. Last month, the billionaire Aydin Dogan sold his remaining media properties, including the influential Hurriyet newspaper and CNN Turk, to a group of Erdogan loyalists. Modern authoritarians rarely seize critical newspapers or TV stations outright. Instead, they use state power to pressure critics and reward friends. As Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, professors at Harvard, wrote in their recent book ""How Democracies Die,"" President Vladimir Putin of Russia turned the tax authorities on Vladimir Gusinsky, owner of an independent television network, NTV, which was considered bothersome. Gusinsky eventually signed NTV over to a government-controlled company. Under Hugo Chávez, Venezuelan authorities accused Guillermo Zuloaga, owner of Globovisión, a TV station frequently critical of the government, of illegal profiteering. In 2013, Zuloaga sold Globovisión to allies of Chávez's successor, Nicolás Maduro. Now Donald Trump is going after Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon and owner of The Washington Post. The president's latest round of anti-Amazon tweets began last Thursday, when Trump claimed, inaccurately, that Amazon pays ""little or no taxes to state & local governments"" and that the United States Postal Service loses money on Amazon deliveries. On Saturday, he wrote that The Washington Post should be forced to ""REGISTER"" as an Amazon lobbyist. On Monday, he warned that Amazon may soon have to pay more for its deliveries: ""Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed."" Trump's antipathy has already affected Amazon's fortunes. He threatened the company during the presidential campaign, and, as Forbes reported, Amazon's stock plunged more than 6 percent after he won. Last Wednesday, after Axios reported that Trump was ""obsessed"" with Amazon, the company lost $53 billion in market value. In the wake of Trump's tweets on Monday, Amazon's stock fell more than 5 percent. Like the F.B.I., another regular Trump target, Amazon is hardly blameless. There's a legitimate case for an antitrust investigation of the behemoth, which as of last year controlled around 44 percent of online retail sales. Lina Khan, director of legal policy at the antimonopoly Open Markets Institute, describes Amazon as the 21st-century equivalent of 19th-century railroads. Many independent retailers feel bullied by the company, she tells me, but have no choice but to use its platform because it's so dominant. But Trump revealed his motive for condemning Amazon when he called for government registration of The Washington Post. A source who spoke to Trump told The Post's own Philip Rucker that ""a negative story in The Post is almost always the catalyst for one of his Amazon rants."" Trump's tweets on Saturday came after The Post published a piece that read like an omnibus of Trump sensitivities: ""From Mueller to Stormy to 'Emoluments,' Trump's Business Is Under Siege."" This is not the first time the Trump administration has appeared to be trying to punish enemies in the media. Reporting on Trump's war with CNN last July, Michael M. Grynbaum of The New York Times wrote that White House advisers had discussed a ""potential point of leverage"" over the network: ""a pending merger between CNN's parent company, Time Warner, and AT&T."" In November, the Department of Justice sued to block the merger. Meanwhile, Trump uses his platform to praise obsequious outlets like Sinclair Broadcast Group, which ordered news anchors on its nearly 200 local television stations to record Trump-style warnings about fake news: ""Unfortunately, some members of the media use their platforms to push their own personal bias and agenda to control 'exactly what people think.'"" After Deadspin produced a creepy viral video of Sinclair anchors reading their script in totalitarian unison, Trump came to the company's defense, tweeting, ""Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC, which is a total joke."" Sinclair's regime-friendly propaganda, which seems meant to erode trust in competing sources of information, is also familiar from other nations that have slid into authoritarianism. ""When you look at many of these countries, it's been a two-pronged attack on the media,"" Daron Acemoglu, a Turkish-born M.I.T. economist and a co-author of ""Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity and Poverty,"" told me. ""Even before the attacks against the Dogan group started in Turkey, or even before the attacks against a few remaining independent TV stations and newspapers had started under Putin, you had these troll-like media outlets that were flooding the market with what we are now calling fake news."" By the time those regimes moved against unsympathetic media companies, much of the population had been disoriented by disinformation. Under Trump, America has started down the same road. There are many reasons to be terrified of Amazon's power, but Trump's ability to undermine it with a tweet is far scarier."

0,2018-04-04," WASHINGTON — Amazon, you're not alone. President Trump once accused Verizon of making ""a STUPID deal"" for AOL. He ridiculed Coca-Cola as ""garbage"" — but said he would keep drinking it. He called both H&R Block and Nordstrom ""terrible."" He said Sony had ""really stupid leadership"" and described executives at S&P Global, a financial firm, as ""losers."" Before and after he became president, Mr. Trump attacked tech firms, military contractors, carmakers, cellphone companies, financial firms, drug companies, air-conditioner makers, sports leagues, Wall Street giants — and many, many media companies, which he has labeled ""shameful,"" ""dishonest,"" ""true garbage,"" ""really dumb,"" ""phony,"" ""failing"" and, broadly, ""the enemy of the American people."" Lately, Mr. Trump's antibusiness rants have become particularly menacing and caused the stocks of some companies to plunge. His Twitter posts have carried with them the threat, sometimes explicit, that he is prepared to use the power of the presidency to undermine the companies that anger him. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, long a booster of Republican presidents, is not happy. ""It's inappropriate for government officials to use their position to attack an American company,"" said Neil Bradley, the executive vice president and chief policy officer of the chamber. Mr. Bradley, who did not specifically name Mr. Trump, added that criticism of companies from politicians ""undermines economic growth and job creation."" Amazon's stock price dropped sharply before rebounding this week after Mr. Trump threatened the company with possible antitrust action. The president's remark in November that the merger of AT&T and Time Warner would not be ""good for the country"" roiled the continuing antitrust fight between the companies and the government. His earlier complaint on Twitter that Boeing's $4 billion price for a new generation of Air Force One was ""out of control"" forced a fresh round of negotiations, although the price fell only to $3.9 billion. Most presidents have clashed with business interests and industries, sometimes in ways that generated headlines. But Mr. Trump is unique in singling out individual companies for ridicule with regularity. And rarely have presidents done so because of a personal pique or grudge, as happens with Mr. Trump. ""This is an unprecedented situation for companies. The president's tweets can cause significant reputational harm,"" said Dean C. Garfield, the president of the Information Technology Industry Council, which represents big technology companies like Amazon, Dell, Facebook, Google and IBM. ""We are now at a place where about 90 percent of the companies we represent now have a presidential Twitter strategy in place."" ""It's no laughing matter,"" he said. For many companies, that strategy comes down to waiting out the storm. In recent days, Amazon has all but ignored the president's taunts, which he issued in a flurry of tweets. ""There's no real advantage going toe-to-toe with him,"" said Joe Lockhart, a press secretary for President Bill Clinton who was a spokesman for the National Football League, another favorite target of Mr. Trump. ""And his attention span is so short, he will move on. He'll find another target."" Associates say the president is often riled up by Amazon's connection to The Washington Post, whose owner, Jeff Bezos, founded the retail giant. People close to the president have said his attacks on one of the country's largest businesses have usually been prompted by articles in The Post that Mr. Trump perceives as negative. Likewise, the president's interest in the AT&T merger with Time Warner largely stems from his repeated clashes with CNN, a subsidiary of Time Warner, which he regards as biased against him. Mr. Trump's lashing out at the N.F.L. — he has repeatedly criticized football players for kneeling at games and once said he hoped a player ""sues the hell out of the @nfl for incompetence & defamation"" — comes in part from his decades-long legal fight with the N.F.L. after he bought a team in the competing United States Football League. As a private citizen, Mr. Trump has attacked companies, including calling several times for boycotts. The remarks served to raise his profile and fed the image of a no-holds-barred businessman who was unafraid to rebuke his rivals or his critics. But in those days, such comments had little ability to move stock prices or affect sales. As a candidate and as the president, Mr. Trump also uses his verbal assaults on companies to bolster his populist message that he is on the side of workers, not big business. (Still, Mr. Trump secured a large tax cut last year for corporate America.) Mr. Trump's most ardent supporters say they appreciate his willingness to criticize the corporate establishment. ""He continues to go directly after the companies and not care about political correctness,"" said Terry Bowman, a former Trump campaign organizer who works at a Ford Motor parts factory in Ypsilanti, Mich. ""He says things that a polished politician would never say. He says things that come directly from the American worker."" President Barack Obama once singled out Staples, the office supply company, for failing to provide more health care for its employees. ""Shame on them,"" he said. Earlier in his presidency, Mr. Obama broadly criticized Wall Street bankers whose firms took federal bailout money only to turn around and award bonuses to their executives. ""That is the height of irresponsibility,"" Mr. Obama said in 2009 without identifying specific companies. ""It is shameful."" Mr. Clinton's Justice Department aggressively pushed to break up Microsoft on the grounds that it was abusing its monopoly position in personal computing to dominate the internet. President John F. Kennedy avoided naming individuals during a fight with the steel industry in 1962. He criticized ""a tiny handful of steel executives whose pursuit of private power and profit exceeds their sense of public responsibility."" President Franklin D. Roosevelt on occasion assailed business executives as ""malefactors of great wealth,"" attributing the memorable phrase to his cousin, Theodore Roosevelt. Neither president made a practice of identifying specific companies or executives. Mr. Trump has had no such reticence. In his most recent attacks on Amazon, he has accused the company of using the United States Postal Service as ""its Delivery Boy"" and claimed that the federal agency was being ripped off by the online retailer. On Tuesday, he insisted that he was right. ""A report just came out. They said $1.47, I believe, or about that for every time they deliver a package, the United States government — meaning the post office — loses $1.47,"" the president said. He added, ominously: ""So Amazon is going to have to pay much more money to the post office. There's no doubt about that."" Mr. Trump's numbers were inaccurate — the Postal Service makes money from Amazon — but business executives say such statements have a chilling effect. When Merck's chief executive, Kenneth C. Frazier, quit a presidential business council last year in protest of some of the White House's policy positions, other members were initially reluctant to come to his defense for fear of a verbal attack by Mr. Trump. The council eventually disbanded but only after much internal negotiation among members to quit in force. The multiday decline of Amazon's stock price after Mr. Trump's repeated jabs at the company has exacerbated such fears, said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management and president of the Chief Executive Leadership Institute. ""Other business leaders don't want to catch the contagion,"" he said. But he added that refusing to engage could also be risky. He said that Mr. Bezos's silence had hurt the company, leaving it exposed to Mr. Trump's accusations that it received subsidies from the Postal Service and was not paying its fair share of taxes. ""The right answer for C.E.O.s is not to engage in a mud fight but to come with facts,"" Mr. Sonnenfeld said. ""U.P.S. and FedEx have their facts, but we haven't heard from Amazon."""

If you're interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. President Trump has been criticizing Amazon over the past week, and on Thursday he suggested — inaccurately — that the company is ripping off the United States Postal Service. Jimmy Kimmel was dumbfounded by the criticism, and Jimmy Fallon took the opportunity to poke fun at Trump. Dwayne Johnson sat down with Kimmel on Tuesday, 48 hours after April Fools' Day, but he still found a way to play a prank on the host. He told Kimmel with seeming sincerity that his girlfriend had played an April Fools' joke on him, pretending to go into labor and nearly letting him take her to the hospital before she revealed the joke. (All of that turned out to be completely made up.) A perfectly reasonable — that is, nonsensical — debate on ""Late Night"" turned into a set-destroying stunt sequence. All parties seemed pleased. Trump's team wants to take its legal battle with Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic-film actress known as Stormy Daniels, into private arbitration. Kimmel thinks ""private arbitration"" sounds like the name of a porn film. Mike Myers appears in ""Terminal,"" a new comic thriller. His part isn't big, but it's his first live-action film role since 2009. He will talk to Fallon on Wednesday night. Cardi B, the rapper, whose interview with Fallon in January became a viral smash, will co-host ""The Tonight Show"" with him on Monday. It'll be the first time the show has officially had a co-host."
2,2018-04-04," SEATTLE — Five times in the last week, President Trump has pointed his Twitter arrows at Amazon over what he insists is a bad deal for the United States Postal Service. Mr. Trump wrote on Tuesday that the agreement, which sets what Amazon pays the Postal Service for many orders, costs American taxpayers billions of dollars. ""I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy,"" he wrote. The details about the deal are not public — they are considered commercially sensitive information — but some of the available evidence suggests the opposite: that Amazon has been a boon to the Postal Service. The Postal Service has experienced a steady decline in the amount of mail it ships as more of its customers turn away from postcards and letters in favor of email, texting and other forms of digital communication. The total pieces of mail it shipped last year was 149 billion, down from 212 billion a decade earlier. Yet there is a bright spot — its business of package shipping, including Amazon orders, which grew to 5.7 billion packages last year from 3.3 billion in 2008. Several years ago, the Postal Service added Sunday delivery for Amazon packages. The agency reported a net loss of $2.7 billion on $69.6 billion in revenue during its last fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, and faces huge retirement benefit obligations. Without Amazon's business, the financial picture at the Postal Service would most likely be bleaker, many analysts say. ""It is one thing to demand better financial performance from the U.S.P.S., but something very different, in our view, to equate the U.S.P.S. financial struggles with the rise of Amazon,"" Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Baird, a stock research firm, wrote in a research report on Tuesday. ""If nothing else, the U.S.P.S. was already generating billions of dollars in operating losses well before Amazon became a large customer."" Of course, Amazon very much depends on the Postal Service to take their packages the last mile to their destination. By one estimate, about 40 percent of Amazon's orders are delivered by the agency, with the rest handled by U.P.S., FedEx and a hodgepodge of other carriers. Companies that do a lot of shipping, like Amazon, often negotiate deals with the Postal Service to pay less than an ordinary person would to send goods. It is essentially a discount for buying in bulk. That is where the president seems to be focused, and partly why Amazon's stock has fallen sharply in the last week. Its shares are down more than 20 points — nearly 1.5 percent — since March 28. But the Postal Service says all such deals it makes are profitable — and must be by law. An independent body, the Postal Regulatory Commission, oversees the rates that the Postal Service charges for its products. By law, the agreements it cuts with corporate customers like Amazon must cover their ""attributable costs"" that directly result from their use of the postal network. Amazon helps lower those costs by organizing the packages it takes to the Post Office by destination ZIP code in over 35 sorting centers around the country, leaving less work that must be done by postal workers. The company relies on the Postal Service strictly for last-mile delivery to customers, short trips that further limit the cost of delivering each package. But in one of his tweet attacks, Mr. Trump seemed to dispute whether Amazon was covering the Postal Service's costs, saying that ""it is reported that the U.S. Post Office will lose $1.50 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon."" Mr. Trump's figure appears to have come from an opinion piece published last year in The Wall Street Journal and written by an investor whose firm held shares in FedEx. The piece argued that the Postal Service was undercharging for the agency's fixed costs, like its post offices and trucks, when calculating its package contracts. The investor said that the minimum amount that the agency allocates to package delivery and similar products — 5.5 percent of the agency's total fixed costs — is far too low. The piece relied on a research report from last April by Citigroup, which said that if those costs were fairly accounted for, it would cost $1.46 more to ship an average package through the Postal Service. Joseph Corbett, the chief financial officer of the Postal Service, said previously that it provided an ""inaccurate and unfair account"" of its package business. While the Postal Service is subject to Freedom of Information Act requests, there is an exemption in the federal law that allows it to avoid releasing particulars of its deals with private businesses like Amazon, said Kevin Kosar, vice president of policy at the R Street Institute, a nonprofit conservative-leaning think tank, who has studied the Postal Service. Amazon's silence about the details of its contract haven't helped clarify matters. Spokesmen for both the Postal Service and Amazon declined to comment for this article. A spokesman for the White House, Raj Shah, didn't respond to a request for comment. Mr. Kosar said he considered it ""wildly unlikely"" that Mr. Trump has reviewed the Postal Service's contract with Amazon and that the president is ""kind of talking through his hat."" Still, he said the Citigroup analysis of the accounting of the Postal Service's deals with companies like Amazon shouldn't be dismissed. There are four commissioners on the Postal Regulatory Commission, none of whom was nominated by Mr. Trump, with one vacancy. The nominations require Senate confirmation. Mr. Kosar said he expected rates to rise. He said the commission had indicated in regulatory filings — before the flurry of tweets by Mr. Trump — that it would consider increases in shipping prices. ""It's just a question of magnitude,"" he said."

He criticized ""a tiny handful of steel executives whose pursuit of private power and profit exceeds their sense of public responsibility."" President Franklin D. Roosevelt on occasion assailed business executives as ""malefactors of great wealth,"" attributing the memorable phrase to his cousin, Theodore Roosevelt. Neither president made a practice of identifying specific companies or executives. Mr. Trump has had no such reticence. In his most recent attacks on Amazon, he has accused the company of using the United States Postal Service as ""its Delivery Boy"" and claimed that the federal agency was being ripped off by the online retailer. On Tuesday, he insisted that he was right. ""A report just came out. They said $1.47, I believe, or about that for every time they deliver a package, the United States government — meaning the post office — loses $1.47,"" the president said. He added, ominously: ""So Amazon is going to have to pay much more money to the post office. There's no doubt about that."" Mr. Trump's numbers were inaccurate — the Postal Service makes money from Amazon — but business executives say such statements have a chilling effect. When Merck's chief executive, Kenneth C. Frazier, quit a presidential business council last year in protest of some of the White House's policy positions, other members were initially reluctant to come to his defense for fear of a verbal attack by Mr. Trump. The council eventually disbanded but only after much internal negotiation among members to quit in force. The multiday decline of Amazon's stock price after Mr. Trump's repeated jabs at the company has exacerbated such fears, said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management and president of the Chief Executive Leadership Institute. ""Other business leaders don't want to catch the contagion,"" he said. But he added that refusing to engage could also be risky. He said that Mr. Bezos's silence had hurt the company, leaving it exposed to Mr. Trump's accusations that it received subsidies from the Postal Service and was not paying its fair share of taxes. ""The right answer for C.E.O.s is not to engage in a mud fight but to come with facts,"" Mr. Sonnenfeld said. ""U.P.S. and FedEx have their facts, but we haven't heard from Amazon."""

If you're interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. President Trump has been criticizing Amazon over the past week, and on Thursday he suggested — inaccurately — that the company is ripping off the United States Postal Service. Jimmy Kimmel was dumbfounded by the criticism, and Jimmy Fallon took the opportunity to poke fun at Trump. Dwayne Johnson sat down with Kimmel on Tuesday, 48 hours after April Fools' Day, but he still found a way to play a prank on the host. He told Kimmel with seeming sincerity that his girlfriend had played an April Fools' joke on him, pretending to go into labor and nearly letting him take her to the hospital before she revealed the joke. (All of that turned out to be completely made up.) A perfectly reasonable — that is, nonsensical — debate on ""Late Night"" turned into a set-destroying stunt sequence. All parties seemed pleased. Trump's team wants to take its legal battle with Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic-film actress known as Stormy Daniels, into private arbitration. Kimmel thinks ""private arbitration"" sounds like the name of a porn film. Mike Myers appears in ""Terminal,"" a new comic thriller. His part isn't big, but it's his first live-action film role since 2009. He will talk to Fallon on Wednesday night. Cardi B, the rapper, whose interview with Fallon in January became a viral smash, will co-host ""The Tonight Show"" with him on Monday. It'll be the first time the show has officially had a co-host."
5,2018-04-04," SEATTLE — Five times in the last week, President Trump has pointed his Twitter arrows at Amazon over what he insists is a bad deal for the United States Postal Service. Mr. Trump wrote on Tuesday that the agreement, which sets what Amazon pays the Postal Service for many orders, costs American taxpayers billions of dollars. ""I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy,"" he wrote. The details about the deal are not public — they are considered commercially sensitive information — but some of the available evidence suggests the opposite: that Amazon has been a boon to the Postal Service. The Postal Service has experienced a steady decline in the amount of mail it ships as more of its customers turn away from postcards and letters in favor of email, texting and other forms of digital communication. The total pieces of mail it shipped last year was 149 billion, down from 212 billion a decade earlier. Yet there is a bright spot — its business of package shipping, including Amazon orders, which grew to 5.7 billion packages last year from 3.3 billion in 2008. Several years ago, the Postal Service added Sunday delivery for Amazon packages. The agency reported a net loss of $2.7 billion on $69.6 billion in revenue during its last fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, and faces huge retirement benefit obligations. Without Amazon's business, the financial picture at the Postal Service would most likely be bleaker, many analysts say. ""It is one thing to demand better financial performance from the U.S.P.S., but something very different, in our view, to equate the U.S.P.S. financial struggles with the rise of Amazon,"" Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Baird, a stock research firm, wrote in a research report on Tuesday. ""If nothing else, the U.S.P.S. was already generating billions of dollars in operating losses well before Amazon became a large customer."" Of course, Amazon very much depends on the Postal Service to take their packages the last mile to their destination. By one estimate, about 40 percent of Amazon's orders are delivered by the agency, with the rest handled by U.P.S., FedEx and a hodgepodge of other carriers. Companies that do a lot of shipping, like Amazon, often negotiate deals with the Postal Service to pay less than an ordinary person would to send goods. It is essentially a discount for buying in bulk. That is where the president seems to be focused, and partly why Amazon's stock has fallen sharply in the last week. Its shares are down more than 20 points — nearly 1.5 percent — since March 28. But the Postal Service says all such deals it makes are profitable — and must be by law. An independent body, the Postal Regulatory Commission, oversees the rates that the Postal Service charges for its products. By law, the agreements it cuts with corporate customers like Amazon must cover their ""attributable costs"" that directly result from their use of the postal network. Amazon helps lower those costs by organizing the packages it takes to the Post Office by destination ZIP code in over 35 sorting centers around the country, leaving less work that must be done by postal workers. The company relies on the Postal Service strictly for last-mile delivery to customers, short trips that further limit the cost of delivering each package. But in one of his tweet attacks, Mr. Trump seemed to dispute whether Amazon was covering the Postal Service's costs, saying that ""it is reported that the U.S. Post Office will lose $1.50 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon."" Mr. Trump's figure appears to have come from an opinion piece published last year in The Wall Street Journal and written by an investor whose firm held shares in FedEx. The piece argued that the Postal Service was undercharging for the agency's fixed costs, like its post offices and trucks, when calculating its package contracts. The investor said that the minimum amount that the agency allocates to package delivery and similar products — 5.5 percent of the agency's total fixed costs — is far too low. The piece relied on a research report from last April by Citigroup, which said that if those costs were fairly accounted for, it would cost $1.46 more to ship an average package through the Postal Service. Joseph Corbett, the chief financial officer of the Postal Service, said previously that it provided an ""inaccurate and unfair account"" of its package business. While the Postal Service is subject to Freedom of Information Act requests, there is an exemption in the federal law that allows it to avoid releasing particulars of its deals with private businesses like Amazon, said Kevin Kosar, vice president of policy at the R Street Institute, a nonprofit conservative-leaning think tank, who has studied the Postal Service. Amazon's silence about the details of its contract haven't helped clarify matters. Spokesmen for both the Postal Service and Amazon declined to comment for this article. A spokesman for the White House, Raj Shah, didn't respond to a request for comment. Mr. Kosar said he considered it ""wildly unlikely"" that Mr. Trump has reviewed the Postal Service's contract with Amazon and that the president is ""kind of talking through his hat."" Still, he said the Citigroup analysis of the accounting of the Postal Service's deals with companies like Amazon shouldn't be dismissed. There are four commissioners on the Postal Regulatory Commission, none of whom was nominated by Mr. Trump, with one vacancy. The nominations require Senate confirmation. Mr. Kosar said he expected rates to rise. He said the commission had indicated in regulatory filings — before the flurry of tweets by Mr. Trump — that it would consider increases in shipping prices. ""It's just a question of magnitude,"" he said."
0,2018-04-10," The queasy truth at the heart of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal, which is so far the company's defining disgrace of 2018, is that its genesis became scandalous only in retrospect. The series of events that now implicate Facebook began in 2014, in plain view, with a listing on Amazon's Mechanical Turk service, where users can complete small tasks for commensurately modest sums of cash. In exchange for installing a Facebook app and completing a survey — in the process granting the app access to parts of your Facebook profile — you would get around a dollar. Maybe two. This was a great deal, at least by the standards of the time. Facebook users were then accustomed to granting apps permission to see their personal data in exchange for much less. It was the tail end of a Facebook era defined by connected apps: games like FarmVille, Candy Crush and Words With Friends; apps that broadcast your extra-Facebook activities, like Spotify and Pinterest; and apps that were almost explicitly about gathering as much useful data as possible from users, like TripAdvisor's Cities I've Visited app, which let you share a digital pushpin map with your friends. Most of these apps, when installed, demanded permission to access ""your profile info,"" which could include things like your activity, birthday, relationship status, interests, religious and political views, likes, education and work history. They could also collect information about users' friends, multiplying their reach. In providing a marketplace for such apps, Facebook made it easy for users to extend their extraordinarily intimate relationship with the site to thousands of third-party developers. One of them turned out to be connected to Cambridge Analytica, which was using the data for right-wing political campaigns — a fact that was lucidly and widely reported as early as 2015 but promptly lost in the roiling insanity of primary season. (As of Facebook's most recent admission, data was collected on as many as 87 million users.) Not that more exposure in the news cycle would have mattered much back then. It was self-evidently absurd to grant a virtual-farming game access to your religious views, but that's just how the platform worked at the time, and so we got used to it, much in the same way we got used to conducting our private lives on any other corporate platform. (When Gmail first started in 2004, the fact that it placed ads based on the contents of users' emails was considered invasive. That feeling passed; Google continued scanning consumer email until 2017, and Gmail now has more than a billion users.) Still, these individually trivial decisions never gave us cause to confront just how much we had come to trust Facebook. Whenever you sign up for any free service, you're aware, in the loosest terms, that you're giving up something. It usually includes a license to use the content you create — be it capital-C Content, like public posts, or things you would intuitively understand as more private, like your direct messages and which profiles you look at — however the service pleases. You could imagine the problem with all this, if asked: You're giving up your privacy to a company that owes you nothing and could end up doing basically anything. But a user concerned about how ad-supported web services would infringe on his privacy is trapped in a sort of predictive hell: always right, but always feeling wrong; never quite able to say what will happen, but always expecting it; both constantly vindicated and yet feeling he's crying wolf. And its users unwittingly took part in a social-data boom and are only now starting to feel the consequences. The ease and speed with which internet users trust tech companies with the data they crave are wildly out of proportion with the risks they're assuming in doing so, in no small part because, out of negligence or institutional blindness, the companies couldn't anticipate the risks themselves. After all, Facebook spent years fortifying itself against hackers and spammers only to be rolled by political actors posing as app developers. This pattern — a boom based on credible-seeming promises that are a little too good to be true, followed years later by a bust confirming that they indeed were — is familiar from a different world: finance. The financial crisis was materially devastating in a way that a privacy crisis couldn't be; poor stewardship of user data isn't going to evict people from their homes. But among the lingering and underrated consequences of the collapse of the global financial system was a total loss in trust in the institutions that were supposed to prevent it. The disorienting and thoroughly unsatisfying Cambridge Analytica saga is a preview of what trailing indicators of the collapse of the data boom might look like: revealing signs, evident years later, that something was rotten with these arrangements, arriving too late to be actionable but soon enough to foster resentment against companies and services on which we've come to depend. Experiences that test our trust of the free-services-for-personal-data internet are accumulating and threaten to become more personal: the failure of Twitter to ban someone who harassed or threatened you; a small but embarrassing email hack resulting in a scammer asking old friends for money and concluding with an admonishment from your provider that you just needed a better password; an identity theft, a suffering credit score and then news of a hack at Equifax, a service to which you never even chose to provide data. Or it could be nothing more than an eerily well-targeted ad, one that suggests that a certain service — maybe one you never even meant to interact with — knows things about you that you don't remember telling it. The wider consequences of these arrangements are harder to quantify and sometimes even to see. They are: a social-media ecosystem that has annexed the news and the public sphere; nascent but increasingly assertive systems of identity and social currency that seek to transcend borders while answering only to investors; billions of lives' worth of trustingly volunteered data in the hands of companies that might want to make money from it, or that might have no need for it anymore, or that might go out of business, change ownership or simply forget what they had in the first place. Perhaps someone — a new partner, an enterprising researcher, a repressive government — might, one day, discover new uses for the data. A loss of faith in tech companies as semipublic infrastructure would also arrive simultaneously with an understanding that that's what they had been all along: services that we depended on, ones we gave ourselves to, and that revealed themselves to be — or merely became — the sorts of services we'd rather not. They're not too big to fail in the banking sense. But they're similarly hard to budge, having constructed entire modes of interaction, consumption and identity verification that are now intimately interwoven with our lives, so all-encompassing that they've practically become invisible. To stop using these products is to leave the internet, and these companies made it their mission to make sure there isn't anywhere else to go. In a recent conference call with reporters, Mark Zuckerberg, the company's chief executive, confessed that Facebook ought to do a better job of putting privacy tools in front of users, but in the same breath he encouraged people to use the tools and to ""make sure that they're comfortable with how their information is used on our services and others."" It was a gesture at dusty old user agreements — an emphasis on the fact that we technically consented to this, and that if he was expected to hold up his end of the deal, we should be too. It called to mind a line of the financial industry's post-crisis defense: Borrowers should have read the fine print. But for the tech industry, this posture is even more of a stretch: It's an argument for honoring the status quo, coming from the people who have made it their mission to destroy it."

""When Muammar Qaddafi's regime fell in 2011, the writer Hisham Matar listened by phone from London as revolutionaries knocked down the doors in Tripoli's Abu Salim prison to free the political dissidents who had been shackled there. Matar hoped his father, Jaballa Matar, an anti-regime activist kidnapped and imprisoned in 1990, was among them. Matar heard cell doors being hammered open one by one. Behind the final door was a blind man who had lost his memory. His only possession was a photograph of Jaballa. This story appears close to the beginning of Matar's Pulitzer Prize-winning memoir THE RETURN, but it is not the prelude to a manhunt: Matar must reconcile himself to his father's death. He nonetheless returns to Libya after living abroad for over three decades, drawn by his childhood memories and a hunger to learn any information he can about his father's final days. In cool, meticulous prose, Matar documents the exquisite joy of the exile's return, and the depth of a grief that knows no closure. The tragedy of his father's disappearance is documented in all its historical specificity — but Matar discovers in his own story a universal one about how fathers remain just out of reach for their sons."" — Sasha Weiss, culture editor, The New York Times Magazine"
2,2018-04-10," EAST SMITHFIELD, Pa. — Huge retailers like Walmart, Amazon and Peapod are fighting for a piece of the online food delivery business. So is David Nowacoski, a chicken and pig farmer here in East Smithfield. Last month, Mr. Nowacoski started a service that delivers locally produced meats, cheeses and vegetables across three counties in northern Pennsylvania. His start-up collects food from far-flung farms and transports it weekly to residents who place their orders online.  We recently spent the day with Mr. Nowacoski and his wife, Marla, traveling about 92 miles in the family minivan, picking up and dropping off food from three farms, one cheese room, one tavern and a bakery.  Even in this rural patch of natural gas fields and deer hunting grounds, where the closest Whole Foods is more than 100 miles away, Amazon's influence is deeply felt. Mr. Nowacoski says Amazon and other big retailers have conditioned consumers to expect a higher level of convenience. ""This is where society is going, and we have to figure out how the small farm plays a role in it,"" he says.  A day on the road with the Nowacoskis shows how exhausting and costly e-commerce can be.  The couple rise at dawn to feed the chickens, then battle icy roads, burning through gasoline — all to ""build baskets"" of items like cheese curds, lettuce and sourdough loaves for a relatively small number of families who are willing to pay for the service. Dressed in overalls and a purple sweatshirt, Mr. Nowacoski walks over to a shed that smells like diesel fuel, dirt and garlic. He mixes garlic powder into the chicken feed as a natural antibiotic.  Mr. Nowacoski raises about 4,000 chickens a year for meat and an additional 600 hens for eggs. In warmer months, the birds live in fields, eating grass, herbs and insects. But on a morning like this — with the temperature around 18 degrees and a snowy mist making it feel even colder — the chickens are kept in a coop with a vaulted ceiling and walls made of clear plastic.  Mr. Nowacoski walks among the birds, carrying a blue feed bucket in each hand. The hens flock to him, while the rooster hangs back, crowing with jealousy and alarm.  ""That bird hates me,"" Mr. Nowacoski says.  With the chickens fed, we walk down a winding dirt road to the pig pen. The sky has gone from light purple to blue-gray, and the snow has stopped. The pigs are still sleeping when we poke our heads into their hut, carpeted with hay. They lie side by side like a band of brothers — warm, plump and blissfully unaware that they have about three weeks left on earth. ""Yeah, boys. Yeah, boys,"" Mr. Nowacoski calls to them.  Most of the 300-pound pigs are opting to sleep in, but a few amble out onto the snowy ground, grunting, snorting and looking for breakfast.  Mr. Nowacoski rubs and scratches their haunches vigorously, sizing up their meat. Confirmed. Three weeks left. A pot of coffee brews in the kitchen, and bacon sizzles on the stove. Ms. Nowacoski stands at the counter organizing online orders on her tablet. There are two dozen orders this week, up from just two during their first week in business. The Nowacoskis grew up in East Smithfield, a town of about 200 residents 75 miles west of Scranton.  Friends since high school, they got married and moved to Princeton, N.J., where Mr. Nowacoski worked for an employee benefits firm.  In 1993, they returned to East Smithfield and bought 80 acres of rolling fields, maple groves and a swamp that they dug out into a lake stocked with catfish and largemouth bass.  Like many farms in the area, the Nowacoskis' land sits above the Marcellus Shale formation, a huge natural gas deposit. The couple lease some of their land to gas companies for hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.  When gas prices were high, the Nowacoskis received enough money to send two of their three children to college without amassing debt. But as prices slumped, the infusion of wealth from the fracking boom all but evaporated. ""Everyone thought they would be millionaires,"" Mr. Nowacoski says. ""Then it just stopped."" The gas money is vanishing while milk prices are also low, putting pressure on farms and the broader economy. The Nowacoskis hope their e-commerce business, Delivered Fresh, can help farmers find new markets for their milk, meat and produce. Every week, shoppers can log into the Delivered Fresh website and pick from a range of locally produced foods. The offerings will grow more bountiful as the weather turns warmer — carrots, beets, kale and potatoes. The Nowacoskis spend Wednesdays picking up food from as many as 20 farms — a loop that sometimes totals 300 miles. They make deliveries on Thursdays and Fridays.  For now, most orders are dropped off at central locales like farm stands or church parking lots. Eventually, Mr. Nowacoski hopes to expand delivery directly to the homes of as many customers as he can.  He buys the items from the farmers at a discount and charges a premium to customers, generating a 25 percent margin that pays for gas, the software he uses to process the orders and advertising. It's not clear how many shoppers can afford ""pasture raised"" chicken breasts that cost $7.95 a pound in an area where household incomes are far below the national median. ""People ask, 'Why do you cost so much?'"" Mr. Nowacoski says. ""The better question is how are others like Walmart able to sell it so cheaply?"" With the minivan loaded with three large coolers, the Nowacoskis pull out of their driveway and head west.  The first stop is a small dairy farm about 35 minutes away in Roseville, to pick up cheese. To reach the farm, we climb a long, lonely hill that cuts through a snow-encrusted field. Near the top of the hill, we turn right and glide down a paved road that resembles a bobsled run. The cheese shop is at the bottom of the driveway, next to a barn. Amanda Kennedy is in her ""cheese room,"" wearing a white smock. She got up at 1:30 in the morning to start making the cheese. She milked the cows at 3 and helped her three children onto the bus at around 7. Ms. Kennedy, who was raised on a farm down the road, hopes that she can weather the turmoil in the dairy industry — which has been roiled by years of low milk prices — by finding a market for her specialty Cheddar and dill cheese curds. Most people are not going to make regular trips to a local farm for a block of cheese, Ms. Kennedy says. ""The biggest thing I struggle with is getting the cheese into the customer's hands,"" she says. Ms. Nowacoski packs the curds into a cooler and leaves Ms. Kennedy a check for $24, and we are back on the road. After dropping off chicken thighs at a tavern along the way, the Nowacoskis drive to Milky Way Farms in Troy, Pa., to pick up bottles of milk for the week's online orders. The lunch menu at the Milky Way restaurant features broccoli salad, vegetable beef soup, lemon pineapple cake and gluten-free bread. The hamburgers are made from beef raised at a farm next door.  We arrive at the restaurant, two weeks before it closes for good. The couple who own it, Ann and Kim Seeley, decided to shut down the family business after 55 years. ""It is the middle of lunch time,"" Ms. Seeley says, taking our order. ""And there is nobody here."" Tourist traffic to the area has dropped, her husband says, and most people no longer take time to sit down for lunch.  Even as the restaurant fades, Mr. Seeley will keep running a store at the farm that sells his chocolate milk, ice cream and egg nog. He's counting on online deliveries to extend his reach farther. ""We have high hopes,"" he says. Fred McNeal, another farmer, joins us for lunch. He runs a farm market in Towanda, Pa., called Farmer Fred's that sells everything from lawn furniture to turkey bone broth and garden seeds.  Mr. McNeal says he never worried about competition from Amazon until the company bought Whole Foods last June. He is convinced that Amazon will find a way to deliver fresh food locally, eating into the market for local goods. ""We see this coming,"" Mr. McNeal says. ""We have to figure out how to give customers what they want or we are going to be another story about a business that didn't adapt.""  After lunch, the Nowacoskis return to their farm to pick up heads of lettuce and then drive to a bakery, minutes before it closes at 4:30 p.m. The couple have been on the road for more than six hours.  They will visit more farms the next day."
0,2018-04-11," Q. Could you please review best practices if one's email is hacked? Is changing the password for that email sufficient? Is it necessary to change the email address (use a whole new email) for each site, like Amazon, that uses the hacked email as the user login? A. If you still have access to the compromised account, changing the password is one of many steps you should take to protect yourself. If you are having trouble regaining control of the account, visit your mail provider's site for instructions on recovering your account. Apple, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo all have guides on their sites, as should other email and internet service providers. Tell your friends that your account was hacked and to ignore any odd messages that appear to have come from you. Your account may have been hacked through malicious software, so scan your computer for malware and viruses with a security program. If you do not have security software installed, you can use Microsoft's built-in Windows Defender or Microsoft Security Essentials. Avast and AVG are among the many companies that make free basic antivirus software for Windows and Mac. Malwarebytes has free and trial versions of its malware-scanning program for Windows and Mac that can work alongside antivirus software. You should also update your computer and devices with the latest security updates. Next, check your mail settings to make sure nothing has been changed — like copies of your messages set to forward to an unfamiliar addresses, unfamiliar entries in your address book, or new links or information added to your email signature file. Take this opportunity to change and update your security questions and answers that your provider uses to confirm your identity if you use the Forgot Password option. While you are in your mail settings, set up two-factor authentication or two-step verification if you have not already and the feature is available from your mail provider. You will need to provide a code or acknowledge a login attempt on another device after you enter your password, but the extra step helps keep your account more secure. If you have rescued your account and bolstered its defenses, you should be able to keep using the address as a login for other sites, but go in and change the password you used with it, along with all the other passwords for other sites where you used the address as your login. You should also update any site where you repeatedly used the same password as the one for the hacked mail account. The Federal Trade Commission has an online guide to dealing with a hacked mail account. And to avoid being hacked again, follow basic precautions like avoiding public wireless networks without using a virtual private network.

0,2018-04-13," Among the many new statistics created by the baseball maven Bill James is the similarity score, which compares players across eras. The most similar player to the Mets' Yoenis Cespedes? Gus Zernial of the early 1950s Philadelphia Athletics. If similarity scores could be applied to television shows, there's no doubt which current series would score as most similar to the classic 1950s cop show ""Dragnet."" Detective Harry Bosch doesn't actually say ""This is the city: Los Angeles, California,"" but ""Bosch"" — whose fourth season went up Friday on Amazon Prime — is the spiritual heir to that granddaddy of laconic L.A. procedurals. It's part of a tradition that carries down through ""Adam-12,"" ""Police Woman,"" ""Quincy, M.E.,"" ""The Shield"" and ""Southland,"" and it wears its nostalgia proudly. Neither the character nor the show makes apologies for being old school. ""Bosch"" isn't the best or most original series, but it's honest and reliable, like Bosch. It plays fair with the viewer, and among fans of its genre, it has a rabid following. Developed for television by Eric Overmyer from novels by Michael Connelly, the show accommodates the modern serial drama's requirements for psychology and back story. Bosch's daughter and ex-wife are significant characters, and the unsolved murder of his mother (with its echoes of the Black Dahlia case) continues to haunt him in Season 4. (A fifth season has already been ordered.) But the soul of the series is procedural crime-solving, and that's more than ever the case in the new season, which focuses on the murder of an African-American lawyer who was about to go to court with a brutality case against the Los Angeles Police Department. Bosch and his team spend their time doing phone dumps, poring through financial records, searching homes and offices and then searching them again, and endlessly, fruitlessly tailing suspects through the Southern California streets and strip malls. They do it all on camera, and they complain about it. A lot. The romantic associations of the setting balance this attention to the quotidian details of police work — the classic bargain of Los Angeles noir. ""Bosch"" is discreet but determined in its use of evocative locations, which this season include the Bradbury Building, the Biltmore Hotel, Du-pars at the Farmers Market, the abandoned Red Line tunnels beneath downtown and, most prominently, the Angels Flight funicular that still runs up and down Bunker Hill. The Smog Cutter, the Silver Lake dive bar, makes its final appearances, having closed late last year. Anchoring it all is the deliberate, heavy quietude of Titus Welliver's performance as Bosch, communicating untold skepticism and disdain through an arched eyebrow or a downturned lip. Mr. Welliver can suggest an entire personality in the way he stares at a whiteboard or silently chooses which chair to sit in, and the show has matched him with other nonhistrionic actors like Jamie Hector (as his partner), Sarah Clarke (his former wife) and Madison Lintz (his daughter). The unhurried pace of ""Bosch"" can sometimes slow to a crawl, the writing can be workmanlike and the secondary story lines involving Bosch's family or Los Angeles politics can be thin.

1,2018-04-13," WASHINGTON — President Trump abruptly issued an executive order on Thursday demanding an evaluation of the Postal Service's finances, asserting the power of his office weeks after accusing Amazon, the online retail giant, of not paying its fair share in postage. In the executive order, issued just before 9 p.m., Mr. Trump created a task force to examine the service's ""unsustainable financial path"" and directed the new panel to ""conduct a thorough evaluation of the operations and finances of the U.S.P.S."" The president does not mention Amazon in the order, but it is clear that he intends for the panel to substantiate his repeated claim that the financial arrangement between the Postal Service and Amazon, its biggest shipper of packages, is a money loser. In December, Mr. Trump railed against the service on Twitter for being ""dumber and poorer"" by losing billions of dollars and not ""charging MUCH MORE"" to Amazon and other shippers. His Twitter attacks date back as far as 2013, when he scoffed at the service for planning to eliminate Saturday mail delivery — ""our poor, poor Country,"" he wrote — and raising the cost of stamps. Postal Service experts and even Mr. Trump's own advisers have privately urged him to back off the accusations, noting that the huge number of packages shipped by Amazon is actually helping to keep the Postal Service financially solvent. While the service has consistently reported net losses for a decade, much of its financial woes are the result of a prolonged decline in the volume of marketing mail and first-class mail. The service makes money on packages, and Amazon is the service's biggest single shipper of packages. But the president has refused to believe those arguments, insisting in a tweet as recently as March 31 that ""the U.S. Post Office will lose $1.50 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon."" ""That amounts to Billions of Dollars,"" he continued. Mr. Trump's repeated attacks on Amazon have focused in part on the company's billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post. People close to Mr. Trump have said the president's tirades against the retailer often come after The Post has published negative articles about him. ""The #AmazonWashingtonPost, sometimes referred to as the guardian of Amazon not paying internet taxes (which they should) is FAKE NEWS!"" he wrote last June. ""Is Fake News Washington Post being used as a lobbyist weapon against Congress to keep Politicians from looking into Amazon no-tax monopoly?"" he wondered the next month. At one point last month, Amazon's stock price tumbled after Mr. Trump's tweets and a suggestion that he might direct the government to take action against the company. Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment late Thursday. But until Thursday night, Mr. Trump had limited his attacks to ones on Twitter. The White House had said the president did not have immediate plans to take any action against Amazon and had given no warning that the executive order was coming. In the order, the president calls on the task force to examine various parts of the Postal Service's business, including ones that appear to directly involve large parts of Amazon's business. That includes the ""expansion and pricing"" of the package delivery market and the service's role in competing with other, private delivery companies. The task force should look at the decline in mail volume and the implications for the service, Mr. Trump said. The order also calls for the task force to look at the service's ""universal service obligation,"" which requires the service to deliver to everyone in the United States, given changes in technology and e-commerce. Some parts of the order appear to hint at further privatization of the Postal Service, indicating that members of the task force should examine ""the U.S.P.S. role in the U.S. economy and in rural areas, communities, and small towns."" In the order, Mr. Trump said that the longstanding financial problems at the Postal Service demand some kind of action. ""A number of factors, including the steep decline in First-Class Mail volume, coupled with legal mandates that compel the U.S.P.S. to incur substantial and inflexible costs, have resulted in a structural deficit,"" Mr. Trump says in the order. ""The U.S.P.S. is on an unsustainable financial path and must be restructured to prevent a taxpayer-funded bailout."" It is unclear how quickly the task force will be assembled, or when its review might result in changes at the Postal Service that could directly affect Amazon and other shippers. In May, Mr. Trump created a similar commission to examine what he said was evidence of large-scale voter fraud in the 2016 election — a claim that was repeatedly debunked by election experts from both major political parties. But he dissolved the commission in January after several legal challenges and a lack of cooperation from Democratic and Republican election officials in a number of states. In the case of the Postal Service order on Thursday night, Mr. Trump demanded that a report of findings be delivered to him by summer's end. He urged the task force to recommend administrative and legislative changes that could be made. Those recommendations could take into account previous studies, including a 2017 analysis by Citigroup, which concluded that the service was charging below market rates for package delivery. The report estimated that if the service increased its parcel rates, Amazon's shipping costs would rise by about $2.6 billion. Some of that money would presumably go to the Postal Service, which in 2014 handled 40 percent of Amazon's packages, according to one 2015 estimate. Mr. Trump's task force does not address the president's other complaint about Amazon: that the online retailer fails to pay sales taxes, giving it an unfair advantage over brick-and-mortar businesses. In fact, while Amazon used to benefit from tax-free sales, it now charges sales tax on the sale of virtually all of its own products. Many third-party merchants who use the service to sell their own goods on Amazon's sites still do not charge sales tax."
2,2018-04-13," Among the many new statistics created by the baseball maven Bill James is the similarity score, which compares players across eras. The most similar player to the Mets' Yoenis Cespedes? Gus Zernial of the early 1950s Philadelphia Athletics. If similarity scores could be applied to television shows, there's no doubt which current series would score as most similar to the classic 1950s cop show ""Dragnet."" Detective Harry Bosch doesn't actually say ""This is the city: Los Angeles, California,"" but ""Bosch"" — whose fourth season went up Friday on Amazon Prime — is the spiritual heir to that granddaddy of laconic L.A. procedurals. It's part of a tradition that carries down through ""Adam-12,"" ""Police Woman,"" ""Quincy, M.E.,"" ""The Shield"" and ""Southland,"" and it wears its nostalgia proudly. Neither the character nor the show makes apologies for being old school. ""Bosch"" isn't the best or most original series, but it's honest and reliable, like Bosch. It plays fair with the viewer, and among fans of its genre, it has a rabid following. Developed for television by Eric Overmyer from novels by Michael Connelly, the show accommodates the modern serial drama's requirements for psychology and back story. Bosch's daughter and ex-wife are significant characters, and the unsolved murder of his mother (with its echoes of the Black Dahlia case) continues to haunt him in Season 4. (A fifth season has already been ordered.) But the soul of the series is procedural crime-solving, and that's more than ever the case in the new season, which focuses on the murder of an African-American lawyer who was about to go to court with a brutality case against the Los Angeles Police Department. Bosch and his team spend their time doing phone dumps, poring through financial records, searching homes and offices and then searching them again, and endlessly, fruitlessly tailing suspects through the Southern California streets and strip malls. They do it all on camera, and they complain about it. A lot. The romantic associations of the setting balance this attention to the quotidian details of police work — the classic bargain of Los Angeles noir. ""Bosch"" is discreet but determined in its use of evocative locations, which this season include the Bradbury Building, the Biltmore Hotel, Du-pars at the Farmers Market, the abandoned Red Line tunnels beneath downtown and, most prominently, the Angels Flight funicular that still runs up and down Bunker Hill. The Smog Cutter, the Silver Lake dive bar, makes its final appearances, having closed late last year. Anchoring it all is the deliberate, heavy quietude of Titus Welliver's performance as Bosch, communicating untold skepticism and disdain through an arched eyebrow or a downturned lip. Mr. Welliver can suggest an entire personality in the way he stares at a whiteboard or silently chooses which chair to sit in, and the show has matched him with other nonhistrionic actors like Jamie Hector (as his partner), Sarah Clarke (his former wife) and Madison Lintz (his daughter). The unhurried pace of ""Bosch"" can sometimes slow to a crawl, the writing can be workmanlike and the secondary story lines involving Bosch's family or Los Angeles politics can be thin. But when it errs, it errs on the side of literalness rather than falseness, of plainness rather than pretension. The show doesn't require patience so much as relaxation. Surrender to its hard-boiled charms, and it will treat you right."

0,2018-04-18," WASHINGTON — Time Warner's chief executive, Jeffrey Bewkes, vigorously defended his company's $85.4 billion merger with AT&T on Wednesday, saying the deal was necessary to confront ""tectonic changes"" in entertainment caused by internet competitors like Netflix and Amazon. Mr. Bewkes was the first top executive from Time Warner and AT&T to take the stand in federal court to argue against the Justice Department's lawsuit to block the merger. The Justice Department had sued to stop the blockbuster deal in November, arguing that a union of the two companies would harm consumers and weaken competition. Before a packed courtroom on Wednesday, Mr. Bewkes portrayed Time Warner as an underdog against Silicon Valley giants that can reach hundreds of millions of users and are spending billions of dollars a year to produce original shows that compete with Time Warner's HBO and Turner Broadcasting. ""We don't have the tech platform, don't have the engineers, don't have the infrastructure,"" Mr. Bewkes said in arguing for his company's need to combine with AT&T, a mobile wireless and satellite television giant with access to more than 150 million subscribers nationwide. In cross-examination, a lawyer for the Justice Department grilled Mr. Bewkes on the underdog narrative, and presented an internal document that Mr. Bewkes wrote in January 2017 to Time Warner's board that touted the company's revenue projections. The document also showed that Time Warner was planning to introduce digital products even without the potential merger. Mr. Bewkes testimony came as the trial that will decide the fate of AT&T's bid for the company enters its fifth week. The trial is being closely watched for the implications it could have on the course of antitrust policy and for how it could shape the landscape of entertainment as legacy media and telecom companies scramble to bulk up against new competition from Silicon Valley. AT&T's chief executive, Randall Stephenson, is expected to testify as soon as Thursday. John Stankey, the AT&T executive who is poised to run Time Warner after the merger, also began testimony on Wednesday afternoon. Arguments are expected to close as early as April 30. Judge Richard J. Leon of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, who is presiding over the case, is expected to take about a month before giving his opinion. For Mr. Bewkes, 65, the courtroom appearance was a rare public pleading to salvage a career-defining deal. The media titan is a 39-year veteran of Time Warner and has been chief executive since 2008, overseeing the spinoff of Time Warner Cable a year later, the rise of HBO and the turbulent evolution of CNN and the Warner Bros. movie studio. Confident and congenial, Mr. Bewkes engaged directly with Judge Leon, leaning forward in his chair and making eye contact as he explained how the media industry is being challenged by Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Netflix. He described the Justice Department's theory that the merged company would threaten to withhold Time Warner content from rival cable operators as ""ridiculous."" Among the biggest problems for Time Warner as a stand-alone television and movie producer is that it does not have access to viewer data to target advertising and other valuable customer information the same way that Amazon and Netflix do, Mr. Bewkes said. ""We don't have emails, contact information, billing information … any of these things,"" he said. At the center of the antitrust trial are arguments over consumer and competitive harms, with attention focused on economic analyses presented by both sides last week. The Justice Department and several consumer groups said the deal would hurt consumers, who would have to pay bigger bills as a result of higher prices for Time Warner programs. The companies have argued that the Justice Department's lawsuit is at least a decade behind the times. Time Warner said companies like Google and Facebook have the most valuable data on users but they are not willing to share that information. Mr. Bewkes said he has also unsuccessfully tried to buy data on viewers from distributors like Comcast, which was only willing to sell limited sets. These trends prompted Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Bewkes in the summer of 2016 to meet to discuss business options, Mr. Bewkes said Wednesday. In late August 2016, over a three-hour lunch on the 10th-floor dining room of the Time Warner building in New York, they agreed a merger made the most sense. The companies' boards approved the plan soon after. The companies announced their deal in October 2016. AT&T and Time Warner said they were surprised that the Justice Department blocked the merger, saying it is highly unusual for the federal government to block a so-called vertical merger of companies that don't directly compete. Judge Leon, who has not commented much throughout the trial, has said the action was a ""rare breed of horse"" but not a ""unicorn."" Mr. Bewkes and Mr. Stephenson have previously suggested that the Justice Department was influenced to block the deal by presidential politics. President Trump said during his election campaign that the deal should be denied. Mr. Trump has also repeatedly bashed CNN for its coverage of his administration. The Justice Department has denied any political interference in its suit to block the deal."
1,2018-04-18," CULVER CITY, Calif. — It was as if they were stepping into 1940, the heart of Hollywood's golden age. The stucco bungalow where Orson Welles puffed on his pipe between ""Citizen Kane"" scenes shimmered in the sun. White roses bloomed along a path leading to the cottage where Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh changed into their ""Gone With the Wind"" costumes. You half expected Cecil B. DeMille to come bounding out of the nearby studio administration building, a mansion modeled after Mount Vernon, to bawl out an underling. Yet a gathering here last week was not about Hollywood's past as much as its future. The official purpose was to commemorate the $12 million restoration of four studio buildings. But the visitors may as well have come to cut the ribbon on a new era in the entertainment industry — one marked by the ascent of streaming giants like Amazon Studios, the compound's new tenant. ""This historic place has become newly relevant,"" a beaming Jeffrey Cooper, Culver City's mayor, told the crowd as Jennifer Salke, the Amazon Studios chief, sliced a green-and-white sash with gargantuan scissors. ""So exciting!"" Ms. Salke said, shaking Mr. Cooper's hand. Two of her Amazon Studios lieutenants, Albert Cheng and Jason Ropell, clapped nearby. Amazon is only renting Culver Studios, as the 14-acre lot is called. Hackman Capital Partners, a real estate investment company, has owned the rectangular property since 2014 and lured Amazon with a plan to spend $600 million on seven new studio buildings and other upgrades by 2021. But Amazon's decision to move its entertainment division to the compound under a 15-year lease — the company had been using nondescript offices in Santa Monica — demonstrates the degree to which the tech giants have woven themselves into the fabric of Hollywood. You can no longer separate one from the other. ""This is mixing old media and new media in a completely harmonious way,"" Michael Hackman, chief executive of Hackman Capital Partners, said by phone on Wednesday. The majestic administration building, for instance, looks much as it did in the 1930s and '40s, when DeMille and David O. Selznick, who produced ""Gone With the Wind,"" had their offices inside. Only now, the movies in the framed posters hanging inside ""the mansion,"" as the building is known in film circles, are owned by Amazon, including ""Manchester by the Sea,"" ""The Handmaiden"" and ""The Big Sick."" ""I like the sense of history because it holds us to a standard,"" Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and chief executive, said when a reporter asked him about the Culver Studios move at an Oscar-season cocktail party. Culver Studios may have a grand past — ""Raging Bull"" and ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" were made here, along with the pilot for the original ""Star Trek"" television series — but the complex also epitomizes the troubles the movie business has encountered over the decades. As a string of owners struggled to adapt to changing audience tastes, new technology and rising costs, vast sections of the campus were sold. (Condominiums now occupy part of the area where Selznick ignited monumental outdoor sets to simulate the burning of Atlanta.) As waves of consolidation buffeted the movie business and fewer films were made, idling some of Culver Studios' stages, the facility turned to television production to pay its bills, much like Hollywood as a whole. By 2004, when a struggling Sony sold the property, years of underinvestment had taken a toll. The old star bungalows were in poor repair. Soundstages were outdated. The mansion smelled like Grandma's house. ""It needed a lot of work, to say the least,"" Mr. Hackman said. (Contrary to popular belief, the mansion was not Tara in ""Gone With the Wind."") Amazon, which has roughly 700 entertainment employees, began moving staff here late last year. More will follow as buildings are completed. ""It's about recognizing the traditions and legacy of Hollywood, while also recognizing that we have the ability to reshape it,"" Mr. Cheng, chief operating officer of Amazon Studios, said of the decision to make Culver Studios the unit's headquarters. Last month, Amazon said it would also lease a four-story building that is going up across the street, giving its Hollywood division a total of 355,000 square feet of office space in Culver City. (Apple recently leased a building three blocks away for its own original content group.) Amazon revealed Wednesday that more than 100 million people globally had a Prime membership, which includes access to its streaming service, and the company is expected to spend $5 billion on movies and television programming this year, according to the J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth. Its 44 original series include ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" and ""The Man in the High Castle."" Amazon has at least 10 movies in various stages of production, including ""Life Itself,"" a highly anticipated romance set for release on Sept. 21. The streaming-service boom has given other old, independently owned soundstage facilities a new lease on life. Bookings have spiked at the Lot, a 1920s-era compound that once belonged to United Artists; Amazon has rented it for shows like ""The Last Tycoon"" and ""Goliath."" Hulu is using Sunset Gower Studios, vacated by Columbia Pictures in 1972, to tape ""I Love You, America,"" starring Sarah Silverman. A few years ago, there was no sadder movie property in Los Angeles than Sunset Bronson Studios, a dilapidated 10-stage facility that Warner Bros. occupied until decamping for Burbank in 1930. Last year, Netflix moved onto that lot, attracted by $200 million in upgrades and a new, 14-story office tower. Another five-story building for Netflix is under construction at Sunset Bronson, which is owned by Hudson Pacific. But nothing quite matches the restoration of Culver Studios, in part because Hackman Capital has paid lavish attention to detail. ""They even took pains to recreate the same texture and color of the cement,"" said Margarita Jerabek, director of historic resources at ESA, a planning firm involved in the project. She pointed to steps leading into the bungalow once used by Gable and Leigh as a dressing room. That white structure, notable for its green shutters and bordered by a tightly clipped lawn, sits just outside the 99-year-old mansion, which was built by Thomas Ince, a silent-film innovator whose 1924 death was suspicious. According to ""Movie Studios of Culver City,"" a 2011 book by the historians Julie Lugo Cerra and Marc Wanamaker, people have long reported sightings of Ince's ghost on the property. ""I personally have not seen him yet,"" Mr. Cheng said. ""But I'm sure he's happy. We plan to take very good care of our new home."""
0,2018-04-19," Is Silicon Valley going to war? In 2013, Amazon beat IBM for a contract to host the United States intelligence community's data cloud. Microsoft now markets Azure Government Secret, its cloud-computing service designed specifically for federal and local governments, to the Defense Department and intelligence agencies. And last year, Google signed a contract with the Pentagon for Project Maven, a pilot program to accelerate the military's use of artificial intelligence. These partnerships might ease anxiety in the Defense Department about China's artificial-intelligence advances and ominous, state-led fusion of civil and military technology development. But a comparable fusion of the United States government and Silicon Valley would be a mistake. This is not so much because it would compromise Silicon Valley values, as more than 3,000 Google employees argued in a recent letter about Project Maven to the company's chief executive, Sundar Pichai. Rather, it's because the United States' edge in techno-military competition exists in great part because we have a tech sector that is not dominated by the state and its needs. Narrowing the focus of the United States tech sector to the needs of the military would serve neither party. On the contrary, it would make the nation weaker. To be sure, defense contracts are hardly new in Silicon Valley, and Google's recent moves might be seen as heralding Silicon Valley's return to its natural home in defense contracting. But that would be to misunderstand both Silicon Valley history and today's technology. The internet and much of digital computing did indeed emerge from decades of United States defense contracts, beginning as long ago as World War I. Yet the Pentagon itself sloughed off the internet — not knowing quite what to do with it, and rightly judging it to be insecure — to the National Science Foundation. When the internet became a commercial concern, the National Science Foundation off-loaded it to the Department of Commerce. Government might have given birth to the internet, but it sure didn't raise it. The emergence of a civilian, entrepreneurial tech culture in the 1970s owed as much intellectually, if not (at first) financially, to the antiwar movement and the 1960s counterculture — hardly friends of the military-industrial complex. Out of this the dominant, highly creative ethos of geek antiauthoritarianism grew. It is hard to believe that closer ties with the military would perpetuate this culture of innovation. The technology involved in projects like Azure Government Secret and Project Maven is also very different from the data-sharing projects of the 1960s. Those older technologies would not have been created in the absence of government funding. Today's projects, in contrast, are all basically A.I. plays. Very little of this is defense-specific, but all of it is useful for defense and espionage. Unlike, say, weapons development, A.I. research is inherently dual-use. United States tech giants would be pursuing it with or without government contracts. Silicon Valley does not need the Pentagon to initiate these endeavors. The Pentagon is in a different position. It came around very reluctantly to the idea that it is dependent on private industry for the defense of the country and the projection of American power. But come around it has, in no small part thanks to China. China's state interest in A.I. was initially economic, but military uses were never far behind. As Elsa B. Kania, a researcher at the Center for a New American Security, explained in an influential report, ""A.I. is a high-level priority within China's national agenda for military-civil fusion,"" a strategy that should allow the Chinese armed forces to benefit from private-sector advances in A.I. The United States military seems to have been spooked. In a 2017 memo, the deputy secretary of defense, Robert O. Work, wrote that while the Defense Department had made ""tentative steps"" in A.I., ""we need to do much more, and move much faster."" The memo announced the formation of Project Maven to do just that. This month, Gen. Stephen Wilson, the vice chief of staff for the Air Force, said that China is taking a ""whole of nation"" approach to A.I. and the United States should, too. Yet we shouldn't forget that civil-military antagonism and the deep American tradition of distrusting the state have been crucial to the United States' ability to innovate. There are good reasons why defense-tech giants of the 1960s, '70s and '80s like Raytheon and Grumman missed out on such major tech advances as Web protocols, the smartphone, personal computers and various types of encryption — all of which would eventually have great military significance. The biggest reason was that none of these advances were directed at waging war; indeed, many aimed at transcending the power of the state. After the Cold War, the Soviet Union's extraordinary technological capacity dissipated in large part because it had been so reactive: The Soviets had let their adversary determine the pace and scope of their own innovation. The United States should not make that mistake."
1,2018-04-19," Sit on a log by the Madidi River in Bolivia at dusk and you can hear what an Amazon forest should sound like. The music includes red howler monkeys, breathy thumps from the mutum jungle fowl, droning cicadas, eerie calls locals attribute to deadly bushmaster vipers and the unhinged excitement of elusive titi monkeys. Around your feet, the beach is crisscrossed by jaguar tracks and those of the pony-size tapir, a shy beast that, if you keep quiet, will saunter out of the forest and swim across the river. This is what scientists call an ""intact forest landscape."" It's a swath of at least 500 square kilometers (about 193 square miles, equal to 70,000 soccer fields) of unbroken forest. Because of their size, these areas have maintained all their native plant and animal life and biophysical processes. These forests still adorn parts of our planet's tropical midsection, notably the Amazon, Congo Basin and the island of New Guinea. And they form a northern belt, the boreal forests of Canada, Russia, Alaska and Scandinavia. Intact forests today total around 11.8 million square kilometers (about 4.6 million square miles), according to estimates by a group of researchers and organizations, including Greenpeace, Global Forest Watch, World Resources Institute, Transparent World, University of Maryland, World Wildlife Fund of Russia and Wildlife Conservation Society. That's roughly the United States and Mexico combined. It's about a quarter of the planet's total forest area, the rest of which is fragmented by roads, mines, cities and agriculture. Over 7 percent has been lost since 2000. Keeping the rest is a key to turning around three stubborn global trends: climate change, the sixth great extinction crisis and the loss of human cultures. In the tropics, intact forests hold 40 percent of the aboveground forest carbon even though they make up only 20 of those latitudes' forests. And intact forests have been shown recently to absorb enough carbon to offset many Amazon countries' (like Peru) total emissions. When forests become fragmented, edge effects (forest damage at created edges), drying and fire cause over 150 million tons of annual emissions — more than result from outright deforestation. The United States Environmental Protection Agency estimates suggest that those emissions cost us $6.3 billion in lost crops, flood damage, fires and other impacts. In the boreal region, forests protect permafrost, which, if it thaws, will be a huge source of heat-trapping methane emissions. Aside from maintaining the global climate, intact forests stabilize weather locally and regionally, which sustains livelihoods for millions of people. Carbon has been fashioned by evolution into a staggering array of plants and animals, many of which are threatened by the current spasm of extinctions. The great intact forests host the most diverse ecosystems and robust populations of top predators, wide-ranging migrants and undiscovered species. They are evolutionary workshops still going full tilt. In places like the western Amazon, intact forests climb mountainsides, giving species altitudinal ladders to survive climate change. The planet's cultural diversity also depends on its big forests. Of the world's approximately 6,900 languages, around a quarter are from the three great tropical forest regions (which have just 6 percent of the land area): 330 languages in the Amazon, 1,100 in New Guinea and its environs and 242 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where most of Africa's intact forests are. Unesco estimates that a language is lost every two weeks. Many are blinking out as the forests that sustain their speakers are eroded. Humanity's very ability to think certain thoughts depends on our great forests. When the renowned Harvard botanist Richard Evans Schultes first arrived in the Amazon (in 1941), he found that some Indians used the same word for ""green"" and ""blue"" but had 18 terms for varieties of a sacred vine that had been identified by baffled scientists as a single species. Forest conservation solutions are practical and affordable. First, roads need to give big forests a wide berth. The principal underlying driver of fragmentation is road-building, which carves forests into progressively smaller patches and has accounted for 81 percent of losses since 2000. And they usually lose money. One study found that a major new highway in the Brazilian Amazon would return around 6.5 cents on each dollar of investment. Money is better spent by intensifying transportation near towns and existing farms, where the infrastructure can serve more people. A 2014 global study in Nature showed that needed road networks could be developed without fragmenting forests. Second, forest peoples' land rights need to be supported, for both ethical and practical reasons. There are almost no forests without people; intact forest wildernesses are forests with few people whose traditions and economies are woven into the landscape. Recent Amazon research shows that legally recognized indigenous territories are extremely effective at preventing deforestation, even where deforestation pressure is high. Parks and nature reserves were also revealed to be effective, especially when tailored to local needs. Third, the adage that you can't manage what you don't measure applies here. A continuous, near-real-time system of monitoring must be put in place to track where intact forests are being cut so that governments, forest communities and private organizations can react early. How will we pay for a future with forest wilderness? Part of the answer lies in programs to avert climate change. A recent economic study indicates that a large share of intact forests could be preserved at a cost of $20 per ton of carbon. That's less than half of one indicative benchmark figure: the $52 midpoint price projected by California for its regulated carbon emissions market in 2030. But for funds to flow, climate policies need to adapt. They now provide little incentive to conserve large, often remote forest areas. That's because the forests are beyond the immediate frontier of expanding agriculture and therefore not recognized by climate protection regimes as targets for campaigns to avoid deforestation. It's difficult to project the baselines of intact forest loss and degradation far into the future, and those predictions are needed to calculate the climate benefits of protecting them. But the United Nations Green Climate Fund and forested countries and donors should embrace that challenge and fill the funding gap. It takes four days and a balsa wood raft to get to that beach in the Bolivian Amazon, which is a big part of the reason its big trees are still standing. Similarly epic journeys will get you to forest gems around the world, where, if you listen, you'll understand a little more about where we came from and where we need to go from here."
0,2018-04-20," The Sarayaku Kichwa who live in the Ecuadorean Amazon believe in the ""Living Jungle,"" where rivers, land, animals and even the wind are interconnected. ""Everything in the jungle is alive and has a spirit,"" said Misha Vallejo, who has been documenting this indigenous community for three years. ""If you destroy something, you will see the consequences somewhere else."" Like at news conferences, at international forums and on social media. These venues have been used by this indigenous group to fight oil exploration in one of the world's most diverse ecosystems. They scored a victory in 2012 when the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled that Ecuador's government had wronged them when it granted oil exploration concessions in the region without consulting their people. The government apologized and reached a financial settlement.  But now the Sarayaku Kichwa are fearful of a repeat of past wrongs as a Chinese firm, with the government's blessing, has been drilling for oil in an area that overlaps with their territory. ""The Sarayaku said the apologies have been forgotten,"" Mr. Vallejo said. ""They are worried it will be the same fight they had before, which was serious.""  Before Mr. Vallejo, a member of the Runa Photos collective, went to the area three years ago, he had to convince members of the community of his intentions. They had previously welcomed people posing as representatives of a nongovernmental organization, only to discover they were actually working for an oil company. ""They were like spies,"" Mr. Vallejo said. ""So the community takes a lot of precautions."" One way to prove himself, he said, was to accept the condition they have for outsiders who want to learn about the area: Newcomers have to share some bit of knowledge or help with a project. On his first trip, Mr. Vallejo made photographs for a catalog of traditional plants in the community's herbarium. Members of the community who had left to study have returned to apply their newly acquired skills and help preserve their culture and the environment. The financial settlement they reached with the government allowed them to set up a local bank, and they have also undertaken projects to provide each home with a solar panel that can power a light and radio. And while they may be far from the city, they are not cut off. An administration building has a satellite internet connection and a generator, which attracts people who want to charge their phones, tablets or laptops (which, apart from connecting them to supporters and allies in the environmental movement, are also good for watching movies). ""This super global tool, you might think was a bad influence, but they use it for their campaigns,"" Mr. Vallejo said. ""It's interesting how there is this influence of foreign culture, and the majority of people there, especially the young, have Facebook and Instagram accounts. They connect to the Western world and borrow some things. For example, when they have feasts, they paint their faces. Used to be they painted spirits. Now, one kid paints his face like a member of Kiss.""  Though outsiders would call them poor, considering their isolation and lack of amenities, they do not. Mr. Vallejo learned this when he went out with them on a five-day hunting trip into the jungle. They set out with no food, except salt, and the knowledge that the jungle would provide. After catching a deer and a caiman one night, they ate it for breakfast. ""It was a deer soup,"" Mr. Vallejo recalled. ""They gave a piece of meat bigger than my head. I said, 'It's too much!' In Quito, I'd pay $3 and get a tiny speck of meat. Here, they told me: 'People say we're poor, but look at how much the jungle provides. We're not poor, we're rich. But it's a different kind of wealth.'"""
1,2018-04-20," In the relatively cozy confines of Australian television production, it's not surprising that actors would turn up in one show after another. Especially given how many of them go off to work in the United States. (G'day, Thor.) Even by Aussie standards, though, Patrick Brammall is busy. And his recent work is all over American streaming video. On Saturday, Netflix introduces ""The Letdown,"" a comedy in which Mr. Brammall has a choice guest role as a loudly impatient drug dealer. Netflix is already home to the two seasons of ""Glitch,"" a paranormal tale that won Australia's top drama-series awards and stars Mr. Brammall as a small-town cop trying to manage the sudden return of a number of the local dead. On Hulu, you can see both seasons of the original ""No Activity,"" a cop comedy he created (with Trent O'Donnell) and starred in, winning an Australian Academy award for best actor. He then brought ""No Activity"" to the United States, starring in a remake for the CBS All Access streaming site that's been renewed for a second season. All this multinational creativity has taken place in the last three years. (Six-episode seasons help.) Mr. Brammall is blandly handsome and on the comfy side of fit, with a knack for playing exasperation in both comic and dramatic situations. His characters are harried, generally well-meaning upholders of the establishment, whether a policeman or a dealer outraged over an intrusion on his assigned turf. His American equivalents might include Chris Pratt and Ryan Reynolds, but he hasn't played superheroes, and any swagger his characters possess is unearned. In ""The Letdown,"" his function is to help convey the degradation that motherhood has brought to the life of the heroine, Audrey, played by Alison Bell. (It's like a middle-class version of Showtime's ""SMILF."") When she parks on a quiet stretch of street hoping her baby will take a nap, Mr. Brammall's Scott descends on her in a cloud of righteous indignation, demanding that she move. Rather than risk waking up the child, Audrey of course agrees to buy some drugs. ""Glitch"" is an entirely different kind of series, a large-ensemble drama predicated on big fuzzy ideas about life, death and destiny in which the separate back stories of multiple characters are rationed out in frequent flashbacks. Mr. Brammall plays the uncalm center of the storm, the police constable James, who is called to the cemetery in the first episode because people are clawing out of their graves. One of them is James's ex-wife, who died four years before (and was the best friend of his new wife). James spends his time running in desperate circles to preserve the anonymity of the returnees and to protect them from threats that include a curious pharmaceutical corporation, mysterious assassins and an invisible, deadly barrier surrounding the town. The show's ideas outpace its execution (not unusual in Australian TV), especially in the second season. But it's not bad as cultish science-fiction curiosities go, with the intellectual suspense balancing the soap-opera mechanics of the returnees tracking down the loose ends of their previous lives. ""No Activity,"" clearly the most personal of Mr. Brammall's projects, renders the buddy-cop comedy in sketch form. (His credits also include a sketch-comedy show, ""The Elegant Gentleman's Guide to Knife Fighting,"" which is streaming on Netflix and Amazon.) Nearly every scene is a static two-character dialogue, between pairs of cops, dispatchers, small-time crooks and, in Season 2, trussed-up husband-and-wife kidnap victims. As the title implies, there's virtually no action — the show consists of the meandering, generally pointless, often smutty conversations that take place while the characters wait for something to happen. (Perhaps reflecting the enclosed spaces and immobility, there's a lot of talk about masturbation.) The primary talkers are Mr. Brammall and Darren Gilshenan as Hendy and Stokes, marginally competent detectives on an endless stakeout, constantly promised by unseen handlers that ""someone big"" is about to show up. Mr. Brammall is, per usual, the straight man, offering futile protests in response to Stokes's winsomely idiotic and offensive riffs. The tables turn in one episode, though, when Stokes is replaced in the car by a taciturn American (played by Jake Johnson of ""New Girl""). Trying for sophisticated small talk, Hendy stumbles onto race as a topic, and Mr. Brammall, with crack timing, stutters out the thoughts of the Australian everyman: ""I know you have to be very sensitive about that thing in your country because you shoot the black — you shoot the people — you shoot people of various ethnic — all sorts."""
2,2018-04-20," Each week, Kevin Roose, technology columnist at The New York Times, discusses developments in the tech industry, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here. Hello again! I'm finally getting back to a somewhat normal existence after last week's Facebookpalooza. I even filed my taxes with several hours to spare, which is a first for me. This week, as Mark Zuckerberg presumably took a very long nap, we heard from another tech billionaire — Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, whose empire (and net worth) makes Mr. Zuckerberg's look relatively modest. Every year, Mr. Bezos' shareholder letter is treated by many Amazon fans as a kind of papal encyclical — an update on company news, interspersed with nuggets of management advice and details of Amazon's inner workings. This year's letter, which was released on Wednesday, has already drawn glowing reviews. Noting that he reads a lot of shareholder letters, my colleague Andrew Ross Sorkin called it ""one of the most engaging I've ever seen."" The CNBC host Jim Cramer said it may have been ""the best I have ever read by any C.E.O."" What was so special about it? Well, for one, it underscored just how unfathomably big Amazon is. Amazon has 560,000 employees, and the company added 130,000 jobs in 2017 alone. For context, that means that Amazon added more than a Facebook's worth of employees during every quarter last year. The company also disclosed, for the first time, the number of Prime subscribers it has: more than 100 million. Those members bought five billion items in 2017, making it the company's biggest year on record. While the median salary at Facebook, a company full of well-fed engineers, is a whopping $240,430, Amazon's median worker salary is only $28,446, reflecting its reliance on an army of low-paid workers at its fulfillment centers. Amazon has been criticized for grueling labor conditions and creepy employee-tracking practices, but the workers keep showing up. As a result, Amazon has become America's second-largest private employer, behind only Walmart. As Jason Del Rey at Recode noted, many of Amazon's fulfillment center employees likely aren't Prime subscribers, since the service has ""skewed way more popular among higher-income households"" than among working-class families. Amazon is trying to broaden its appeal beyond the mass affluent by introducing monthly payment plans and discounts for people on government assistance, but there is still room for competition on the lower end of the market. (Personally, I'm fascinated by Wish, the online dollar store that has given American consumers direct access to a flood of cheap goods produced in China.) Other notable findings from Mr. Bezos' letter: ■ Amazon doesn't allow PowerPoint slides during meetings. ""Instead, we write narratively structured six-page memos,"" then silently read them before meetings begin, Mr. Bezos wrote. ■ Mr. Bezos spent a lot of time talking about his standards — specifically, high ones. ""I believe high standards are domain specific,"" he wrote, ""and that you have to learn high standards separately in every arena of interest."" He continued: ""You can consider yourself a person of high standards in general and still have debilitating blind spots."" ■ Mr. Bezos gave updates on Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods, and said Amazon was working on ways to ""recognize Prime members"" at Whole Foods checkout counters, which sounds both exciting and extremely creepy. ■ Mr. Bezos took inspiration from an unlikely source — a ""handstand coach"" who helped a friend of his learn how to do a full handstand. The coach, he wrote, warned his friend that realistically, she would need to spend six months practicing. The story taught him that ""to achieve high standards yourself or as part of a team, you need to form and proactively communicate realistic beliefs about how hard something is going to be."" One thing notably absent from Mr. Bezos' letter was any mention of HQ2, the company's much-ballyhooed search for a second headquarters. Amazon officials reportedly visited Newark this month, and have also visited Philadelphia and other finalist cities as they try to make a final decision this year. Amazon's economic dominance — made clear by the staggering facts and figures in Mr. Bezos' letter — makes the billions of dollars in tax breaks and incentives that have been offered to Amazon by job-hungry cities look even more ridiculous. If there's one company that doesn't need your city's largess, it's Amazon. A few other tech stories of note this week: ■ Cambridge Analytica, the sketchy political data firm that has been at the center of Facebook's recent privacy scandal, has sought to develop its own cryptocurrency and conduct an initial coin offering, because of course it has. ■ Speaking of Facebook, my colleague Sapna Maheshwari reports that its advertising team has been quietly reaching out to big clients, trying to keep them from jumping ship as the social network struggles with its public image. Carolyn Everson, a Facebook ad executive, has reportedly ""received many public messages of support and praise for her leadership on Twitter and on her Facebook page from agency executives and chief marketing officers, including those at General Electric and Toys 'R' Us."" Truly, I am touched. ■ Marissa Mayer, the former chief executive of Yahoo, emerged from the Witness Protection Program to give an interview to my colleague David Gelles.

0,2018-04-22," One of Amazon's antagonists seized the moment last month with an unusual newspaper advertisement addressed to President Trump. The ad, from a nonprofit that advocates less government, attacked a Defense Department technology contract that Amazon intends to bid on, calling it a lucrative handout for the company. A top think tank critic of Amazon's market power also credited Mr. Trump on Twitter this month for blasting the internet retailer's relationship with the United States Postal Service. And the head of a leading labor union said more Americans in both parties should speak out, as Mr. Trump has, about Amazon's harmful effect on jobs. As Mr. Trump has become Amazon's basher in chief with his frequent Twitter attacks on the company and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, the president has also become an unlikely ally for an array of Amazon critics. Most of them — from think tanks to advocates for local businesses — have struggled for years to build any momentum for their arguments, since Washington officials mostly held Amazon up as a beacon of innovation and shoppers saw little to dislike in its prices, selection and convenience. Now ""what Trump is essentially doing is telling the political ecosystem: Here is how you achieve your business ends,"" said Blair Levin, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former chief of staff for the Federal Communications Commission. ""He is signaling: If you want to go after Amazon, go ahead. Load up your guns."" But while Amazon's opponents now have the country's most powerful bullhorn on their side, they aren't entirely comfortable with the association. Some are concerned about the president's motivations for his attacks, which people close to Mr. Trump have said are often triggered by negative coverage of his administration in The Washington Post, a newspaper owned personally by Mr. Bezos. Mr. Trump has mingled his attacks on Amazon and the newspaper in some tweets, including one in early April slamming ""the Fake News Washington Post, Amazon's 'chief lobbyist.'"" Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, a think tank that has become a vocal critic of the power of tech companies, said he believed Amazon was worthy of action by regulators in part because of its power in the book market. But he also said he found Mr. Trump's efforts to ""personalize law enforcement"" troubling. ""What he's doing is a threat to democracy, but so is Amazon,"" Mr. Stoller said. ""That's the dilemma."" Still, early this month, after Mr. Trump launched another Twitter tirade against Amazon's deal with the Postal Service, Mr. Stoller jumped on board on Twitter. ""On the post office shipping charges Trump is correct and oddly aligned with postal employees while Bezos isn't, so I'm going to stick with the postal employees,"" he wrote. The most direct effort to tap Mr. Trump's hostility toward Amazon was an advertisement last month about the contract to provide cloud computing services to the Defense Department — worth up to $10 billion, by some estimates. The ad, with a picture of Mr. Bezos looking chummy next to Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, appeared in the president's favorite hometown tabloid. ""President Trump: Your Defense Department is set to award a no-bid, ten-year contract for all its IT infrastructure to Administration-enemy Jeff Bezos' Amazon,"" read the ad in The New York Post. ""I had never seen that before,"" Katell Thielemann, an analyst who follows the government technology contracting market for the research firm Gartner, said of the attack ad. The ad was placed by Less Government, which calls itself a nonprofit based in Washington, D.C. Seton Motley, who runs the group, did not respond to requests for comment. He has said in interviews that he funded the ad himself. It's unclear who backs the group, but there are large tech companies, some with connections to Mr. Trump, that have expressed their unhappiness with how the contract is structured. The contract came up in a dinner this month with Mr. Trump and Safra Catz, co-chief executive of Oracle, according to a person briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because the details are confidential. Ms. Catz told the president that the way the Defense Department had written the contract, awarding it to just one vendor, was an advantage to Amazon, the person said. So far, Mr. Trump hasn't publicly expressed concern about Amazon's bid for the contract. The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Trump recently escalated his attacks on Amazon with a presidential order to review the Postal Service's financial model, which he has denounced on Twitter as money-losing because of favorable deals worked out with Amazon. (The Postal Service denies that deals like its one with Amazon are unprofitable.) ""The playing field has to be leveled,"" he told reporters this month, promising to take a serious look at policies that might affect Amazon. Mr. Trump's Amazon attacks have amplified criticisms that have been building for years among research groups and trade organizations that represent Amazon's rivals. They have produced studies that say Amazon's warehouses — which employ more than 125,000 full-time workers in the United States — don't increase total local employment because of losses in other sectors. They also question the wisdom of subsidies to attract them. The American Booksellers Association, which represents independent bookstores, recently published a similar report on Amazon's economic impact. The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, one of the largest private-sector unions in the country, representing 1.3 million workers in grocery stores and related industries, said Amazon's investments in automation would hurt workers. Since it bought Whole Foods last year, Amazon has become one of the union's top concerns. Asked about Mr. Trump's attacks on Amazon, Marc Perrone, president of the union, said: ""Allowing Amazon's unchecked growth to continue will lead to the destruction of millions of American jobs. Which begs the question: Why aren't all Democrats and Republicans speaking out?"" A spokesman for Amazon declined to comment. When Mr. Trump bashes Amazon for not collecting taxes, he is echoing long-running criticism of the company by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan research organization. Amazon collects sales tax in states that have one for items it sells directly to shoppers, but in most states it does not when shoppers buy merchandise from independent merchants on Amazon. Other critics — from technology pundits to a former chief executive of Walmart U.S. — have called for antitrust action against Amazon by the government, including a breakup of the company. Amazon's defense is that — even as it has swelled into a giant, with over $177 billion in revenue last year — its share of overall retail sales is still small, estimated to be in the mid-single digits in the United States. This, along with Amazon's emphasis on keeping prices low, has made it challenging for opponents to spark action under current antitrust law, which is primarily focused on consumer harm. It's unclear if Mr. Trump can do much to get antitrust enforcers at the Federal Trade Commission or Justice Department, which are supposed to keep politics out of competition cases, to act against Amazon. But his executive order asking for a review of the Postal Service, including its relationship with customers like Amazon, could lead to changes unfavorable to the company."
0,2018-04-23,"  Good Monday. Here's what we're watching: • What might happen to Amazon's bottom line if it paid its workers more? • Sears shares jumped after ESL called on the Sears to sell the Kenmore brand. • Walmart is said to be close to gaining a majority stake in Flipkart. • Mike Bloomberg opened his wallet for climate change. • Learn more about ""transshipping,"" one of President Trump's big trade bugbears. Want this in your inbox each morning? Sign up here. Amazon surprised some last week when it disclosed in a filing that the median compensation of its employees was $28,466. The expectation in some quarters was that Amazon might have had a higher pay number, in part because it is a fast-growing, cutting-edge company. But Amazon's revenue is dominated by its retail operations, a business that typically has lower wages. What might happen to Amazon's bottom line if it paid its workers more? This question may become more pressing if labor shortages start to force companies to up their pay to attract and retain employees. Amazon does not disclose its total compensation expense, so it's not possible for outsiders to accurately compute what would happen to profits if it raised pay. But the disclosure of median pay provides a little insight. Under S.E.C. rules, public companies must now disclose the median pay figure for all their employees. In annual filings, that number is then compared with the pay of the chief executive. In Amazon's case, the $1,681,840 that Jeff Bezos earned in 2017 was 59 times that of the median employee, a lower ratio than exists at other large public companies. One way to get a rough proxy for a company's overall compensation expense is to multiply its median pay number by its total number of employees. For Amazon, that would produce a purely hypothetical compensation expense of $16.1 billion (566,000 employees times $28,466.) Increasing Amazon's median pay number by 10 percent would bump the $28,466 up to $31,313, and the putative compensation expense would rise to $17.7 billion. Such an increase would have cut Amazon's $3.8 billion of pretax income in 2017 by 42 percent to $2.2 billion. A 20 percent raise would have slashed those earnings by 85 percent. How does Amazon stack up against Walmart? The C.E.O. of Walmart, Doug McMillion, made $22.8 million in the company's latest fiscal year. That sum was 1,188 times as large as the median employee's pay of $19,177 (a number that excludes some foreign employees.) At Walmart, increasing the hypothetical compensation expense would have less of an impact on earnings. A 10 percent increase would reduce Walmart's latest annual pretax profits by 28 percent, while a 20 percent pay increase would lower profits by 56 percent. There are two ways to view such numbers. One is that retail is a cutthroat business and wages cannot rise by much if a company is going to be healthily profitable. The other is that large retailers have used their heft to lower as many of their costs as possible, including wages. — Peter Eavis Strong advertising sales during the first quarter helped Google-parent Alphabet beat analysts expectations. The company's bottom line also received a lift from a change in accounting for its investments in startups. • Net profit jumped 73% to $9.4 billion in the first quarter, up from $5.4 billion a year ago. • Earnings per share came in at $13.33 per share, beating analyst estimates of $9.28 per share. • The company reported a $3 billion, or about $3.40 a share, gain on equity securities in the first quarter. • Sales rose to $31.1 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $30.3 billion. • Traffic costs hit $6.3 billion, up 35% from a year earlier. Shares of Alphabet bounced around after hours. The stock rose as much as 2.2 percent but is now down slightly. Critics' corner Robert Cryan of Breakingviews writes: Shares of Sears Holding are up about 4 percent in recent trading on Mr. Lampert's latest attempt to save the troubled retailer. In a letter to the Sears board, Mr. Lampert, whose ESL Investments hedge fund owns a controlling stake in the company, said ESL would also be willing to buy the retailer's home-services and its appliance-parts units. Mr. Lampert offered to pay Sears $500 million for the home-services and appliance-parts units, but did not mention a price for the Kenmore brand or the real estate. He noted that the company had been trying to sell the assets for nearly two years, but had failed to find other buyers. Mr. Lampert is Sears's chief executive. Any deal involving Sears and Mr. Lampert is complicated by his dual roles running both the retailer and the hedge fund, which is also a major Sears lender. Mr. Lampert said in his letter that he would recuse himself from any board discussions about his proposal. Any deal would need to be approved by a majority of Sears shareholders not affiliated with ESL, the letter said. Sears has already sold some assets, closed hundreds of stores and laid off workers across the country as offset falling sales. The company sold its Craftsman tool brand to Stanley Black & Decker for $775 million last year. — Michael Corkery The European Commission said Monday that it has opened an in-depth investigation into Apple's acquisition of Shazam, the maker of an app that identifies songs after listening to just a few seconds of them. Margrethe Vestager, the European Union's competition commissioner, said in a statement: The European Commission is concerned that Shazam's strong position in music recognition would enable Apple to ""obtain access to commercially sensitive data about customers of its competitors."" The European Commission has until Sept. 4 to finish its investigation. Apple reached a deal to buy Shazam for roughly $400 million in December. The U.S. retail giant is reportedly close to buying a majority stake in Flipkart, the top e-commerce company in India, at a $20 billion valuation, according to Bloomberg. Existing investors like Tiger Global Management and SoftBank have agreed to sell substantial portions of their shares, giving Walmart a stake of 60 percent to 80 percent. Why it's important: Both Walmart and Amazon have hungrily watched India, where the e-commerce market trails only the U.S. and China in terms of size but where foreign retailers have struggled. But don't expect Amazon, Flipkart's biggest rival, to give up. Move over, Spotify: Tencent Music reportedly plans to interview potential underwriters for a U.S. I.P.O., with a valuation exceeding $25 billion, according to WSJ. (It could also be the latest instance of a spinoff helping its Chinese parent's financial fortunes.) Elsewhere in deals: Elliott Management wants Hyundai to reorganize its divisions and pay out more dividends. HNA cut its stake in Deutsche Bank amid its downsizing. How China is buying into Europe. Deutsche Telekom plans to fight Vodafone's plan to buy Liberty Media's German and Eastern Europe cable division. The parent company of Poker Stars agreed to buy Sky Betting & Gaming for $4.7 billion to get a foothold in Europe. Fresenius walked away from its $4.3 billion deal for Akorn, a maker of cancer drugs. Just over a month after cutting a deal with Carl Icahn (an agreement that Mr. Icahn's frenemy Bill Ackman said was ""a deal with the devil""), the consumer brands conglomerate has reached an accord with Starboard Value as well. What's in the peace agreement: Newell will name three new directors. Two — Gerardo Lopez, the C.E.O. of Extended Stay America, and Robert Steele, a former senior executive at Procter & Gamble — are independent. The third, Bridget Ryan Berman, a former C.E.O. of `Armany and executive at Google and Victoria's Secret, was agreed upon by Starboard and Mr. Icahn. How it came together: In a joint news release, Mr. Icahn said that Newell asked him to parley with Starboard. Key to reaching a truce was Mr. Icahn giving up two seats that he had taken on Newell's board. What the parties said about the deal • Michael Polk, Newell's C.E.O.: ""This agreement will enable the Company to now focus exclusively on the execution of our transformation plans and our efforts to strengthen our financial and operational performance."" • Mr. Icahn: ""I am pleased that we were able to facilitate peace between the company and Starboard. Given that the company has so many more pressing priorities, this is clearly the best outcome for all shareholders."" • Jeff Smith, Starboard's C.E.O.: ""We are confident this newly reconstituted board will bring a refreshed sense of urgency, oversight, and accountability to Newell."" The market reaction: Shares in Newell were up over 3 percent in premarket trading on Monday. — Michael de la Merced Even after the Trump administration withdrew from the Paris climate accord, Mr. Bloomberg insisted that the U.S. keep up its financial obligations to the U.N. body overseeing the pact — using $4.5 million of his own money. ""I'm going to send them a check for the monies that America had promised to the organization as though they got it from the federal government,"" Mr. Bloomberg told CBS's ""Face the Nation."" The former N.Y.C. mayor has shown he has no problem speaking out on his personal causes, even if they're in opposition to President Trump's policies. And he's willing to put his own money to work as well. What Mr. Bloomberg isn't doing: Running for president — at the moment. ""I think I can as a private citizen help in some of those things and that's what I want to do with my life,"" he said. ""If you talk China, I've watched where the reporters have been writing 2 percent of our steel comes from China. Well, that's not right,"" President Trump said last month, before criticizing transshipping. The practice, which disguises the origins of metals and other imports, is a reason behind the U.S.'s fight with China — and  the E.U., South Korea and Canada have moved to crack down on illicit uses of the maneuver. (Certain instances can be legal.) Meanwhile, Steven Mnuchin is weighing a trip to Beijing, in the hopes that talks could avoid a full-blown trade war.

1,2018-04-23," Q. I keep getting these ""Congratulations!"" messages about winning prizes from Amazon.com, even when I'm not using the site. Why is this? A. Those persistent pop-up messages are not from Amazon, but are part of a wave of malicious display advertisements — also known as ""malvertising"" — invading desktop, Android and iPhone browsers. The intrusive ads can also appear when browsing links that are posted on Facebook.  Malvertising has been a problem for years, but lately has become more pervasive on mobile devices. Symantec, a security company, noted this year that the ""congratulations"" malware has been making a strong push onto Android devices with a Trojan horse called Android.Fakeyouwon. In January, the cybersecurity company Confiant also outlined how the recent malware was spread across the web by fraudulent advertising agencies, which placed tainted ads on legitimate sites. If you select the pop-up's O.K. button or try to dismiss the box, the browser is typically redirected to a page that promises prizes for participation in a quiz.  Interacting with the quiz may infect your system with malware or give the scammers access to your Facebook friends list. If you get a ""congratulations"" box on your screen with no way out, forcibly quit the browser to escape. If scam messages are regularly popping up on your screen, your computer or device may be infected. To disinfect your system, run an anti-malware utility like Malwarebytes AdwCleaner for Windows; Malwarebytes for the Mac scans for adware, too. Microsoft has a Malicious Software Tool for Windows. Apple's support site has guides for blocking pop-ups in the Safari browser and clearing the history and website data from an iOS device.

0,2018-04-24," Former F.B.I. director James Comey's book, ""A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,"" has dominated headlines for more than a week, and became an instant blockbuster, selling more than 600,000 copies in all formats during its first week on sale. Mr. Comey's publisher, Flatiron Books, has ordered multiple reprints to meet demand, and now has more than a million copies in print. The early sales figures for Mr. Comey's book dwarfed other recent political best sellers. Hillary Clinton's memoir, ""What Happened,"" sold more than 300,000 copies in all formats in its first week on sale.

Mr. Wolff's book, which came out in January, has sold more than 2 million copies to date. Mr. Comey has no doubt benefited from wall-to-wall television coverage. He has given revealing interviews on every major news network, drawing angry tweets from President Trump, which in turn prompted more news coverage of the book. That cycle will likely drag on as Mr. Comey continues his book promotion tour this week with an appearance at a CNN Town Hall and an interview on Fox News Channel. [Click here to read The Times review of the book.] But the book is also, not surprisingly, polarizing, much like Mr. Comey himself.

2,2018-04-24," SAN FRANCISCO — Amazon packages get delivered to all sorts of places. Front porches? Naturally. Cubicles? Of course. Inside locked homes? Yes, that, too. Now add a new one: the trunk of your car. Starting Tuesday, people in dozens of cities across the United States can start getting their Amazon orders delivered to a parked car, provided their vehicle has the proper technology. With a few taps on a smartphone screen, the courier can unlock the car and drop the box inside the trunk or on the back seat. The new service is aimed at anyone who doesn't want to risk having their package swiped from their front porch or who can't receive an Amazon order at work, perhaps because an employer doesn't allow it or because the company mailroom is not secure. On Monday, the company showed how it worked: An Amazon driver fetched a box from the back of a van and headed toward her delivery destination — the trunk of an empty, gleaming Volvo S90 sedan in a parking lot. After she hit a couple of buttons on an app, the trunk was unlocked and the package went inside, then was locked in the car, where — had this not been a staged demonstration — it would have waited for its owner. Amazon has dived into delivery convenience and security with gusto. To reduce package theft, it has installed lockers outside physical stores where customers can pick up orders. And last year, it introduced Amazon Key, which lets its couriers unlock customers' front doors and drop packages inside. The new in-car delivery service, which will be available in 37 cities and surrounding areas, is a variation of Amazon Key. For in-car delivery to work, customers must have a 2015 or later Chevrolet, Buick, GMC or Cadillac vehicle with an active account with OnStar, the roadside assistance and navigation service from General Motors. Car owners with 2015 or newer Volvos with a similar service, On Call, can also receive in-car deliveries from Amazon. Couriers can use those assistance services to find the cars through satellite location-tracking and unlock the trunk. Amazon said the service will be expanded to other carmakers over time. The company conducted a small pilot test of in-car delivery in Germany in partnership with Audi and DHL several years ago. The company says its systems will allow couriers to unlock vehicles only once for each scheduled delivery, to prevent unauthorized access. Still, the service will require a hefty amount of trust that a courier won't swipe any valuables. The in-car service requires fewer protections than Amazon's in-home delivery service, which requires customers to have an internet-connected front door lock and security camera to deter any shenanigans by couriers once they're inside. ""We believe in offering customers choices,"" said Rohit Shrivastava, general manager of Amazon Key. ""This product may not be for everyone."" Although statistics on the prevalence of package theft are elusive, police departments across the country say it has become commonplace, especially as internet shopping has become mainstream behavior. Package thieves have even earned a snappy moniker, ""porch pirates."" James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, said Amazon has for years been ferociously tackling every obstacle it can identify to customers buying more goods online. ""This goes back to one-click ordering,"" he said. ""The company knows that the less friction you have, the better."" Customers won't be able to get in-car deliveries if they park inside gated and underground parking garages where satellite signals often can't penetrate. The service seems aimed especially at people who leave their vehicles in the lots of large, easily accessible suburban office parks. Car owners, who are frequently discouraged from leaving valuables in their vehicles, may rightly be concerned receiving an Amazon package to their cars when they're not present could make them a target. Amazon said customers shouldn't worry — it will take care of a broken window or lock that happens as a result of a delivery to a car. ""If the damage is caused by a delivery and a customer calls, we will make sure it's right,"" Mr. Shrivastava said."
0,2018-04-25," When Amazon announced in January that Nashville had made the list of 20 finalists being considered for its second North American headquarters, city leaders cheered. They saw the project as the next step in Nashville's transformation from country-music capital into a regional and even national economic force. To some locals, Amazon represented something else: more people, more traffic and, most of all, higher rents in a city where a rising share of residents were already struggling to afford a place to live. ""With the onslaught of new people, with the onslaught of higher-income earners, I just think it's going to further exacerbate what's already a crisis situation,"" said Paulette Coleman, a local affordable-housing advocate. Ms. Coleman has reason to worry. A new analysis from the real estate site Zillow estimates that rents in Nashville would rise 3.3 percent per year if the city landed the Amazon campus, almost four times as fast as currently projected. After a decade, that could translate into Nashville residents paying $400 more per month in extra rent because of the project. Other cities could also see big increases if Amazon picks them. Monthly rents in Boston and Los Angeles could jump by even larger amounts in dollar terms — albeit from a higher starting point — reflecting a shortfall in rental housing construction. Denver — like Nashville, a midsize city that has seen brisk population growth in recent years — could see its already rapid rate of rent increases hit nearly 6 percent per year, triple the overall rate of inflation. ""I definitely think it has the possibility of pushing us over the tipping point,"" said Felicia Griffin, executive director of United for a New Economy, a Colorado nonprofit that has opposed the Amazon project. Some potential locations would be less severely affected. Atlanta and Chicago, big cities that have made it relatively easy to build new housing in recent decades, would see only a small rent increase if they won the Amazon project.  And Indianapolis, where population growth has been slow and housing is plentiful, would see no effect on its rents at all, according to Zillow's model. Even in those cities, however, neighborhoods near the Amazon campus would most likely see significant rent increases. (The study did not look at the effect on prices of owner-occupied homes.) Amazon has provided few details about what it plans for the new campus, known as HQ2, other than that it could eventually be a base for up to 50,000 employees earning an average of about $100,000. The company hasn't said whether it prefers to build downtown, as it has at its current headquarters in Seattle, or will opt instead for a suburban office park — a decision that could have significant implications for the project's effect on local housing costs. Though it mentioned the issue only in passing in its request for proposals last fall, Amazon says it will take such costs into account, and has met with affordable-housing groups in several of the finalist cities. Zillow cautions that its estimates are rough, based on a simple model that looks at how rents in each city have responded to past influxes of workers. If the cities respond differently to Amazon's arrival — for example, by building more housing — the impact on rents could be smaller than Zillow's model estimates.  But there are also reasons to think Zillow's analysis could understate Amazon's potential impact. The model looks only at the effect of the jobs that the new campus is expected to create directly. If Amazon's presence draws other businesses to the area, rents could rise even faster. That's what has happened in Seattle, where a mini-Silicon Valley has sprung up around Amazon's downtown campus. Facebook, Google and other internet giants have opened satellite offices nearby, and start-ups — including Zillow itself — have their headquarters there.  The boom has been good for Seattle's economy, which has experienced years of steady job growth, low unemployment and, unlike much of the country, strong wage gains. But it has also become a far less affordable place to live. Rents in Seattle now rival those in Boston and New York, and home prices are rising faster there than in any other big city. Amazon says it has contributed more than $40 million to affordable-housing projects in the city, as part of obtaining approval for its plans. Whichever city wins the HQ2 sweepstakes will enjoy one big advantage over Seattle: advance warning. Aaron Terrazas, a Zillow economist who led the rent analysis, said Amazon's growth caught Seattle by surprise, and the city struggled to build enough housing to accommodate the influx of young, affluent tech workers. Whichever city is chosen, Mr. Terrazas said, needs to move quickly to build. ""What's so important is once a city is selected that they start to get ahead of the curve,"" Mr. Terrazas said. So far, however, cities have been focused mostly on attracting Amazon in the first place. City and state governments have rolled out the red carpet for the company, offering tax incentives and other inducements. But the public response has been more lukewarm, particularly in cities where rising housing costs have already led to concerns about affordability and gentrification.  A recent Elon University poll of residents in the finalist cities found that while relatively few residents outright oppose Amazon moving to their city, only 43 percent strongly supported such a move. Residents in many cities said they were concerned that Amazon's arrival would increase the cost of living and opposed offering special incentives to attract the company. In Nashville, the debate over HQ2 has gotten caught up in a broader discussion of gentrification, race and the consequences of growth. Residents long described Nashville as a small town disguised as a big city. But over the last decade, the city's tourism industry has taken off, and some of those tourists liked Nashville enough to stay. For years, the Nashville metropolitan area grew by more than 100 residents per day, with many of them moving into newly built downtown apartment complexes. As in other cities that have experienced such booms, the growth has led to tensions. Longtime residents, many of them African-American, have been displaced, and the city's homeless population has grown. A recent study commissioned by the mayor's office found that the city had lost 18,000 affordable housing units since 2000. That gap could grow to 31,000 units by 2025 if current trends continue — without taking Amazon into account. ""There are many neighborhoods in Nashville where the fight is lost,"" said James Fraser, a Vanderbilt University professor who has been active in the city's affordable-housing movement.  Adriane Harris, who leads housing policy for the Nashville mayor's office, said concerns about gentrification were legitimate. But she said there were two sides to the affordability equation: housing costs and income. Nashville's tourism economy depends heavily on low-wage service workers. The promise of HQ2 is that it could be the foundation of a new, more lucrative industry. ""If we're only addressing housing, then I don't think we're getting to the root of the issue,"" Ms. Harris said. ""Wage growth is critical in this conversation."" Affordable-housing groups, however, worry that current Nashville residents won't be, for the most part, the beneficiaries of the high-paying jobs that Amazon promises. Fabian Bedne, a Nashville City Council member, said the city should ask the company to help mitigate its impact, perhaps by financing affordable-housing programs. ""We welcome technology, we welcome great jobs to the city, and I think people would even welcome Amazon, but it would have to be a trade-off there,"" Mr. Bedne said. ""People don't want to sign a suicide pact."" Jenny Schuetz, a Brookings Institution economist who has studied housing policy, said cities would be wise to start planning for HQ2 even before Amazon announced its decision, which is expected this year. The good news, Ms. Schuetz said, is that the steps cities should be taking to prepare for Amazon are largely the steps they should be taking anyway, like improving transit systems and easing regulations that make it hard to build in the places people want to live. Amazon, Ms. Schuetz added, should also take housing costs, traffic congestion and related issues into account. After all, she said, Amazon won't benefit if its workers can't find places to live, or if they are viewed by existing residents as a hostile force. ""It's going to be a long-term relationship,"" Ms. Schuetz said. ""To retain good workers over the long haul, you should care about what housing costs could be."""
0,2018-04-26," SEATTLE — Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and chief executive, long ago figured out how to keep Amazon's sales figures shooting skyward. Now he is doing the same with profit. The company, which once seemed to have only a passing interest in turning a profit, said its net income for the first quarter more than doubled. Although Amazon is best known as an internet shopping destination, its cloud computing and advertising businesses were big contributors to the jump in profit. Mr. Bezos singled out the performance of the company's cloud computing business — known as Amazon Web Services, or A.W.S. — referring in a statement to a ""remarkable acceleration"" in growth in the segment for a second consecutive quarter. Amazon often boasts of its commitment to lowering prices — part of the reason its profits have been so limited until now — but on Thursday it announced a price hike for one of its most important offerings. The company said it was raising the price of its Prime membership service 20 percent, to $119 from $99. Prime memberships include two-day shipping at no extra cost, a video streaming service and other benefits. Amazon's shares surged 7 percent in after-hours trading following the release of the quarterly news. The company reported that its net income for the first quarter, which ended March 31, was $1.63 billion, or $3.27 per share, compared with net income of $724 million, or $1.48 per share, in the same period last year. Revenue jumped 43 percent to $51 billion, up from $35.7 billion a year earlier. The average estimate of financial analysts, compiled by Thomson Reuters, was for revenue of $49.87 billion and earnings of $1.27 a share. ""This was an unusually strong quarter for Amazon, where results came in both better for revenue and profits across the board,"" said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. Like Facebook, which has faced a grilling in Congress over its data protection practices, Amazon has faced criticism in Washington. President Trump has regularly slammed the company, saying it was killing jobs and not collecting enough taxes. But as with Facebook's users, Amazon's customers have apparently not been swayed by criticism of politicians, though many of Mr. Trump's attacks happened after the end of the quarter. Amazon's revenue received a big lift from the company's acquisition of Whole Foods Markets last year. The company's physical stores business, most of which is from Whole Foods, added $4.26 billion in revenue for the quarter. Revenue from A.W.S., meanwhile, rose 49 percent to $5.44 billion from the same period a year earlier. That increase is larger that what the A.W.S. business was seeing just a few quarters ago. It is unusual to see revenue growth increase significantly at Amazon's size and in a hypercompetitive market, and it seems to have prompted Mr. Bezos to single out the business in his statement. Mr. Mahaney, the RBC analyst, said, ""That's rare to see him say something like that."" The increase in the cost of Prime memberships came shortly after Mr. Bezos announced, in the company's annual shareholder letter, that Amazon had more than 100 million Prime subscribers globally. During the first quarter, revenue from subscription services, including Prime, jumped 60 percent to $3.1 billion. Amazon said the price on Prime will go up on May 11 for new members, and starting June 16 for renewals of membership for existing members. The company said the increase, the first for its annual plan in four years, was the result of significantly increased costs for the service. Those include the billions of dollars that Amazon has poured into financing new television shows and movies which have been added to its video streaming service. On Thursday, it announced with the National Football League a renewed agreement for Amazon to exclusively stream Thursday night football games to Prime subscribers. In a call with financial analysts, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, said that four years ago, Prime members could receive free two-day shipping on about 20 million products from Amazon. Now that figure is 100 million. ""There's all kinds of new features that we've continually added to the Prime program,"" Mr. Olsavsky said. ""It's much different than it was in 2014."""
1,2018-04-26," Walmart is nearing a deal to acquire a majority stake in India's leading online retailer, a bold move that would open another front in its escalating war with Amazon. The Indian company, Flipkart, is a start-up that sells everything from clothing to smartphones in the country's blossoming e-commerce market. The two sides are in advanced discussions, and a deal could be announced soon, according to three people briefed on the matter. Exact terms are not yet final, and the talks are fluid, said these people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the negotiations were continuing. Two of the people said that the deal would value Flipkart at about $20 billion and that Walmart was looking to acquire a stake of at least 60 percent. The deal would be an aggressive and, some analysts say, risky foray by Walmart into one of the world's last great open markets for online retailing. Although India has a significant middle class, most of the nation's enormous population is still far too poor to afford much more than basic necessities. Flipkart has posted billions of dollars in losses while trying to build its business. Still, Walmart missed out on China's e-commerce boom, and it does not want to make the same mistake with India — especially with its rival Amazon already a strong player there. Only about 2 percent of India's retail sales are online now, but tens of millions of Indians are getting onto the internet every year via cheap smartphones and rock-bottom mobile data prices. Amazon has committed at least $5.5 billion so far to building its India presence, fighting to gain market share among the country's young, increasingly tech-savvy shoppers. After starting an Indian site, Amazon.in, from scratch in 2013, Amazon blew past local players like Snapdeal and is now a close No. 2 to Flipkart in sales. Walmart's interest in India is the latest extension of the retailer's battle with Amazon. Rooted for decades in its network of stores, Walmart has been trying to bolster its online offerings. In just the past few years, it has acquired the hip, largely online clothing brands Bonobos and ModCloth, started a higher-end mattress and bedding line sold exclusively online and expanded home grocery delivery to 100 American cities. Based in Bangalore, Flipkart was founded in 2007 by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal. The two men, who are not related, worked briefly at Amazon's back-office operations in India before deciding to form their own company. Like Amazon, Flipkart initially started selling books online before expanding into a vast array of products. On its way to becoming India's top online retailer, it successfully navigated problems such as customers' preference for paying in cash and the country's spotty roads and delivery networks. While Walmart operates stores around the globe, India would be a relatively new frontier for the huge retailer. The company operates wholesale stores in India, but it has no public-facing retail or e-commerce presence. Flipkart would be one of Walmart's largest acquisitions since it acquired Asda, a large British grocery chain, in 1999. That deal would be valued at about $16 billion today, adjusted for inflation. Analysts point out that Walmart has made very few large acquisitions in its 56-year history and that some of those deals remain works in progress. Walmart made a big splash in 2016 when it purchased the e-commerce site Jet.com for $3.3 billion. Jet, based in Hoboken, N.J., was supposed to be Walmart's answer to Amazon's appeal with higher-income, urban-dwelling millennials in the United States. But there are signs that Walmart is still trying to fully integrate Jet into its larger e-commerce strategy. After reporting that its e-commerce sales growth had slowed in the fourth quarter, Walmart said it would focus on driving new customers through its main Walmart.com site, not through the Jet platform. Acquiring Flipkart would give Walmart an instant leg up on Amazon in India, but it is still likely to face stiff competition from its primary rival. Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, views India as his chance to make up for the company's failure to establish a major presence in China, just like Walmart. That likely means the online giant will double down on its investment there now that Walmart has come onto the scene. ""I don't think they should do it,"" Scott Mushkin, a retail analyst at Wolfe Research, said of Walmart's potential deal for Flipkart. ""Amazon is like an A.T.M. machine. I wouldn't want to be competing with Amazon in India."" In addition to pouring billions into its Indian e-commerce site, Amazon is also investing in original content from Bollywood movie studios and has developed local versions of crucial products, such as its Prime video streaming and Echo voice-activated speakers. Amazon's assault was so intense that a couple of years ago, some analysts were predicting that Flipkart would be crushed. Complicating matters, Flipkart was racked by management turmoil. But Tiger Global, one of Flipkart's earliest and largest investors, pushed for the appointment of one of its own executives, Kalyan Krishnamurthy, as chief executive in January 2017. Mr. Krishnamurthy is credited with steadying the company and improving the customer experience. SoftBank, a Japanese investment firm that has been making large bets in India over the last few years, also agreed to provide $2.5 billion in fresh capital last summer. Walmart would bring an even larger potential source of funding to Flipkart as it tries to keep growing. ""For the ecosystem, this is good,"" said Satish Meena, a senior analyst in New Delhi for Forrester, a technology research firm. ""There is more money and more expertise coming into the system. And customers will get more products at a lower price."" The e-commerce market in India, which includes categories like travel, was about $38.5 billion last year, and it is expected to grow to $50 billion in 2018, according to a recent study by Deloitte and the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India. ""The whole game now is scale,"" said Bill Dreher, a retail analyst at Susquehanna International Group."
0,2018-04-27,"  Good Friday. Here's what we're watching: • Does Amazon have its shipping costs under control? • What will come out of the Merkel-Trump meeting? • Why Deutsche Bank was so late to make necessary cuts. • More complaints have emerged about NBC News's response to harassment allegations. Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. Amazon's shipping costs have suddenly become a hot subject, not just to President Trump, but also to the 100 million people who have Amazon Prime. Higher shipping costs are a reason Amazon is raising the cost of Prime membership to $119 a year from $99. But a 20 percent hike is a lot for even a popular service, and it could turn customers off. So why did Amazon do it? The e-commerce giant's results provide some clues. Members of Prime get free shipping, though their membership fees partially pay for that perk. As the Prime program covers more goods, it's getting more expensive for Amazon. ""Our two-day shipping, it's now available on over 100 million items, up from 20 million as recently as 2014,"" Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon's C.F.O., said on a conference call Thursday when announcing the increase in the Prime membership fee. The cost pressures from shipping are getting uncomfortable for Amazon. Worldwide shipping costs totaled $6.1 billion in the first quarter of this year, equivalent to 22.5 percent of Amazon's sales from its online stores during the period. That's up from 2017, when quarterly shipping costs averaged 19.9 percent of online sales. By bringing shipping costs back down to 20 percent of online sales, Amazon could, in theory, save over $2.5 billion a year (2.5 percent of annualized first-quarter sales comes to roughly $2.8 billion.) To save money, Amazon could offer free shipping on fewer goods, but that could undermine the company's efforts to bolster sales. And Amazon doesn't need to do that if it can increase its Prime fees, to help recoup the higher shipping costs. But the fee increase may not be enough. Charging 100 million Prime members an extra $20 per year, in theory, raises ""only"" $2 billion. - Peter Eavis The German chancellor is meeting with President Trump today, in an 11th-hour attempt to avoid a U.S.-Europe trade battle. European leaders are feeling pessimistic about that. (After all, President Emmanuel Macron of France didn't seem to manage it, and he's a Trump favorite.) More on her challenge, from the NYT: Or as a former State Department official told the NYT, ""Merkel is going to Washington and it looks like the U.S. just doesn't care."" But a foreign relations expert said, ""Never underestimate Merkel."" In related news: Oleg Deripaska hopes European governments can convince the U.S. to ease sanctions on his aluminum producer, Rusal. Sprint and T-Mobile are in advanced discussions about merging, and a deal could be announced as soon as this weekend, people briefed on the matter said on Friday. A combination of the two companies would complete one of the telecommunications industry's most long-awaited transactions and would create the third-largest wireless carrier in the United States, with more than 127 million customers. Sprint and T-Mobile have tried to negotiate a merger twice before. Analysts have argued, and Sprint and T-Mobile themselves have acknowledged, that the companies need greater scale and more resources to better compete against the industry's leaders, Verizon and AT&T. Should the deal be completed, only three companies would dominate the market in the United States for cellphone service. It is unclear whether the transaction would get regulatory approval. A previous round of merger talks ended in 2014, having drawn strong opposition from the Obama administration. — Michael de la Merced The hedge fund mogul had been a 21st Century Fox director since 2015, but didn't say why he was leaving, according to a joint statement by his firm, ValueAct Capital, and the company. (He did add that he supports the $52.4 billion sale of Fox assets to Disney.) What Mr. Ubben had to say: ""The management and board of FOX has done a superb job of steering the company through a time of transition for the entertainment industry."" What Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch had to say: ""Jeff has been an important partner during a transformational period. Our board and, ultimately, our shareholders, have benefited enormously from his many contributions."" — Michael de la Merced Economic growth cooled during the first quarter, offering a preliminary glance at how last year's sweeping package of tax cuts is affecting consumers and businesses this year. The economy grew at an annual rate of 2.3 percent for the first three months of 2018. The pace was below the 2.9 percent annualized rate recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, but equal to the performance for all of last year. It also falls short of President Trump's goal of at least 3 percent. • Consumer spending rose 1.1 percent, its smallest gain since 2013. • Nonresidential fixed investment — what businesses spend on equipment, software, buildings and intellectual property — increased at a solid 6.1 percent. • Business spending on equipment climbed 4.7 percent, down from 11.6 percent in the fourth quarter. • Employment cost index rose 0.8 percent. Bigger picture Economists on Wall Street and in Washington have repeatedly warned that the economy's upward streak is unlikely to extend beyond the next year or two. Over the longer term, the Fed expects real annual growth in the United States to fall to 1.8 percent. The Congressional Budget Office's 10-year outlook comes to the same disappointing conclusion. The nation's debt has topped $21 trillion and is growing, a level many view as unsustainable. And if the Federal Reserve follows through on its plan to raise interest rates, the cost of paying off that debt will grow larger.  Yesterday's announcement by the German lender that it was retrenching was a long time coming — too long, for many critics. Peter Eavis has some potential reasons it decided to retreat so late in the game: • Hubris: Unlike rivals, Deutsche Bank didn't raise capital after the financial crisis, ultimately leaving it significantly weaker. By the end of last year, its tangible equity capital ratio was still below JPMorgan Chase in 2011. (Perhaps Germany's banking regulator should have applied more pressure, as Switzerland's did.) • Fear: Did Deutsche Bank's leaders worry about scaling back the investment bank because of its huge importance for revenue? (Last year, it provided 54 percent.) And about the cost of unwinding some trades? Who could benefit from Deutsche's pullback? JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup on the debt side, and Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan on the equity side, according to analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. The news organization asserted that the complaints that led to Matt Lauer being ousted from the ""Today"" show were the first of their kind.

A company spokesman disputed this. • Linda Vester, a former correspondent, told Variety that she had been sexually harassed by Tom Brokaw. He denied the accusation. What NBC News has done: Brought in a consultant for in-person sexual harassment prevention seminars and pledged to share the results of an internal review.

0,2018-04-29," SEATTLE — When 10 representatives from Amazon visited the Denver area in late January, they did what you'd expect from a company scouting for a place to put its second headquarters. They toured more than a half-dozen potential sites for a new campus and talked about the technical talent available in the area. But they also did something that surprised local officials: Quiz them on how, if Amazon chooses to settle there, the company could avoid the problems it confronts in Seattle, the only hometown it has ever known. If Amazon moves in, bringing up to 50,000 high-paying jobs to town over time, how would the officials deal with traffic on its roads? And how would the company's tax dollars contribute to the creation of affordable housing in the region? ""I think they feel in Seattle they're the scapegoat every time there's an issue in the community and traffic,"" said Sam Bailey, vice president of economic development at the Metro Denver Economic Development Corporation, which is managing the area's bid for Amazon's second headquarters. Amazon's search for a second headquarters has been a pageant of finalist cities doing everything they can to woo the company and the good jobs and huge construction projects it would bring. The most controversial part of the process has been the big tax incentives that some state and local governments have offered Amazon, seen by critics as ineffective corporate giveaways. Amazon wrapped up its visits in mid-April to all 20 finalist locations for its HQ2, as Amazon calls its second headquarters. The company is now following up with the cities, from Los Angeles to Indianapolis to Toronto, seeking further information as it narrows its search. The company has a long wish list, including plentiful flights at local airports, a stable, business-friendly government and nearby recreational opportunities for employees. But local officials did not anticipate Amazon's interest in how to tackle some of the troubles that have turned it into a polarizing symbol of Seattle's booming economy. The e-commerce giant is celebrated by many in Seattle for being the city's biggest employer and adding tremendous wealth to the area. But it is villainized by others for bringing too much change, too quickly. In Denver, Amazon and local officials talked at length about public transit options and the creation of bike lanes, said Mr. Bailey. They even discussed the possibility of Amazon financing a new light-rail station for its system, though no commitments were made, he said. In Atlanta, the company spoke to a representative of the Westside Future Fund, a nonprofit working to prevent displacement in an area being redeveloped. The fund will pay for the increases in property taxes for residents who have lived in the area since at least 2016 so that they're not priced out of their homes. In Amazon's visit to Toronto, the company discussed its potential impact on the labor market and the affordability of housing, said Ed Clark, the business adviser to Kathleen Wynne, the premier of the province of Ontario. ""We're all concerned about what could be gentrification or displacement, how do we deal with that,"" said Aisha Glover, president and chief executive of the Newark Community Economic Development Corporation, which is involved in the New Jersey city's bid. Adam Sedo, a spokesman for Amazon, confirmed that public transport and housing affordability were important topics in conversations with the finalist locations but declined to elaborate further. The company employs about 45,000 people in Seattle, spread out among more than 30 buildings near the downtown area. Despite a construction frenzy, building of new homes hasn't kept up with demand, leading to soaring housing costs in Seattle, where rents are now close to those in Boston and New York and home prices are growing faster than those in any other large city. While Amazon is not the only reason for all the change, it has become the most convenient target for groups worried about home prices and paralyzing traffic. ""There was clearly a sensitivity both to the real and to the perceived impact when they come in to a place,"" Mr. Clark said, referring to Amazon's discussions in Toronto. The company says it has given $40 million for affordable housing projects in Seattle. In a new office building it is constructing, Amazon has agreed to give a rent-free space to a homeless shelter for families. The company says its employees are big users of public transportation, with 17 percent of its local employees living in the same ZIP code in which they work. ""The pace of change has been so fast and housing supply has not kept up and the transit system has not kept up,"" said Alan Durning, executive director of Sightline Institute, a nonprofit research group in Seattle focused on sustainability. ""There's a visceral public reaction to the whole rapid pace of change in the city symbolized by, and perhaps blamed too much on, Amazon."" In May, Seattle's City Council plans to vote on a tax — dubbed the ""Amazon Tax"" by locals — on the city's largest employers. The tax is expected to raise $75 million annually, with most of the money being funneled into building affordable housing. The remainder will go to support services for the homeless. This month, supporters of the plan staged a rally in front of Amazon's  glass spheres in Seattle holding signs that read ""Tax Amazon"" and ""Tax Bezos,"" referring to the company's chief executive, Jeff Bezos. Asked why Amazon was discussing affordable housing with officials of the finalist cities for its second headquarters, Kshama Sawant, a socialist member of the Seattle City Council, said it was because of what's happening in the company's hometown. ""It's because they're getting massive pushback from ordinary people in Seattle,"" said Ms. Sawant. Growing cities with thriving local tech scenes are already grappling with affordable housing challenges, even without Amazon. Mr. Clark, the adviser involved in Toronto's bid, said it helps that Amazon isn't ducking the problem. ""To have someone coming in and worried about this issue and wanting to work with you to solve the issue is a big plus,"" he said."
0,2018-05-01," As Amazon dances through courtship rituals with the 20 cities hoping to host its second headquarters, the company is also charging ahead on a slate of other real estate projects. This week, the e-commerce giant announced a significant expansion of its offices in Boston and Vancouver, British Columbia, planning for a total of 5,000 new tech jobs. Earlier in April, it said it would open its fourth fulfillment center in Nevada, bringing more than 1,000 jobs to North Las Vegas. In March, it revealed plans to build its first such facility in Missouri. ""They've been on a pretty blistering pace, getting a lot of space everywhere,"" said Greg Melich, an analyst with MoffettNathanson. Building research and development centers to support new technology, while also enlarging its vast network of distribution centers, has increased Amazon's capital expenditures so that they now roughly equal Walmart's, Mr. Melich said. In Boston, Amazon confirmed on Tuesday that it would move into 430,000 square feet in WS Development's Seaport project, bringing 2,000 jobs in machine learning, speech science, cloud computing and robotics engineering. That will double its technology work force in the metropolitan area. The emphasis on speech science is a sign that Amazon is betting that its Alexa digital assistant is at the vanguard of voice-based commerce, a form of shopping that Mr. Melich said was poised to grow at a rapid clip the way mobile buying did several years ago. Boston is one of the finalists in the heated competition to lure Amazon's new headquarters, known as HQ2. The project promises up to 50,000 new jobs and more than $5 billion in investment — but has also raised concerns about rising property prices and intensifying urban congestion. It was not clear if Amazon's investment in the Boston Seaport project offered any clues to the city's chances of landing HQ2. The company is expected to announce its selection this year. ""Everyone wants the cake, which is the headquarters, but if not, they'll take the icing,"" said Dennis Frenchman, a professor of urban design and planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Boston officials approved $5 million in property tax incentives over 15 years for Amazon to occupy its Seaport offices, and have dangled another $5 million in breaks if the company agrees to more local expansion and job creation. On Monday in Vancouver, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, helped Amazon announce a new 416,000-square-foot-office, to open in 2022 at the Post, a site redeveloped by the QuadReal Property Group. The facility will add 3,000 tech jobs to Amazon's current head count in the area. Vancouver did not land on Amazon's short list of possible headquarters locations. But it is a three-hour drive from Seattle, where Amazon is based, and a short flight from the California tech centers where Amazon likes to recruit employees. Vancouver has also drawn attention from Microsoft, which is based across the border in Washington State. Microsoft helped back the creation of a direct seaplane service between Seattle and Vancouver that began last week. The company said in September that it would pitch in $50,000 to supplement $300,000 in Washington State funding for a study of how to link the Pacific Northwest to Vancouver via high-speed rail."
1,2018-05-01,
0,2018-05-03," SEATTLE — Amazon abruptly escalated a fight with its hometown on Wednesday, halting major expansion plans in Seattle because of a tax being considered by the City Council. The new tax would charge large employers in the city about $500 per employee, with the money going to help alleviate a housing crisis. The tax is squarely aimed at Amazon, which is Seattle's largest employer and frequently blamed by many residents for the city's soaring housing costs. The company said it would halt construction of a new building it was planning to erect downtown and reconsider occupying another that is already under construction, putting 7,000 or more jobs in jeopardy. Late Wednesday morning, Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, said that ""pending the outcome of the head tax vote by City Council, Amazon has paused all construction planning"" on a large building in downtown Seattle that was scheduled to begin construction later this year. Mr. Herdener also said Amazon was ""evaluating options"" to lease out space it had planned to use in another building that is already going up elsewhere downtown. The decision took city officials and developers by surprise. In a statement, Seattle's mayor said she was alarmed by Amazon's announcement and added that she planned to work with members of Seattle's business, labor and community leaders in the coming days to find common ground. The council is expected to vote on the tax proposal on May 14. ""I'm deeply concerned about the impact this decision will have on a large range of jobs — from our building trades, to restaurant workers, to nurses, manufacturing jobs and tech workers,"" said Mayor Jenny Durkan. ""At the same time, our city must urgently address our homelessness and affordability crisis and lift up those who have been left behind."" Amazon's decision comes as officials in other communities across the country are jockeying to bring Amazon's business to town. The company is shopping for a second headquarters elsewhere in North America, saying it has outgrown Seattle. And just this week it announced plans to hire thousands more employees in Vancouver and Boston. The plan the Seattle City Council is  discussing would apply only to companies with at least $20 million or more annually in taxable gross receipts. The so-called head tax would be transformed into a payroll tax in 2021. Three-quarters of the estimated $75 million that the tax raises would go to building almost 1,800 affordable housing units in the city, with the rest funding services for the homeless, the City Council said. Amazon, Seattle's largest employer with more than 45,000 local employees, would owe $20 million to $30 million annually from the head tax and perhaps significantly more when the payroll tax kicks in. For months, Amazon has been quietly lobbying behind the scenes against the tax proposal. Its unexpected announcement could be nothing more than a negotiating tactic to help extract concessions from the council. Mike O'Brien, a member of the Seattle City Council, said Amazon representatives told him on Wednesday morning that they were pausing their expansion projects in the city, without leaving room for discussion. ""They're not really asking for anything,"" he said. ""They're just telling us what they're going to do."" Mr. O'Brien said Amazon should not be solely blamed for the homeless problem in Seattle, but that the company bears some responsibility. ""From my point of view, we have a crisis in our town around housing affordability and homelessness,"" he said. ""They're closely related and it's related to the booming tech industry in Seattle."" He added, ""I need to run a city that has room for prosperous businesses, but doesn't do it at the expense of people getting pushed into poverty."" Greg Johnson, the president of Wright Runstad & Co., a development firm that is constructing the building that Amazon said it may lease out, said an Amazon executive told him of the plans on Tuesday night. Amazon has a lease for about 720,000 square feet in the 58-story tower. ""What's troubling is the 4,500 people Amazon was going to put in the building, they're now considering elsewhere, and I don't think it's elsewhere in Seattle,"" Mr. Johnson said. Seattle had a tax on hours worked by employees in the city starting in 2008, though it was phased out after several years. States typically grant the authority to tax at the local level, and 13 states allow some form of local income tax, according to Bill Fox, a professor at the University of Tennessee who specializes in state and local taxation issues.  Other cities with booming tech economies, like San Francisco, are also seeing housing prices soar because of intense local resistance to allowing more development. In Seattle, people unable to keep up with the costs live in their cars or in tents by the sides of freeways. Those who are better off park recreational vehicles in industrial neighborhoods. In 2017, the Seattle area had the third largest homeless population in the country after New York and Los Angeles, according to an annual report to Congress by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. After years of criticism for being disengaged from the civic life of its hometown, Amazon has in recent years attempted to show a more compassionate side in Seattle. It has agreed to allow a homeless shelter for families, Mary's Place, to occupy space rent-free in another building that it is putting up. That is one of several buildings that Amazon still intends to complete. Still, even within Amazon itself, there are haves and have-nots. While it is common for employees at its headquarters in Seattle earn $100,000 to $200,000 a year, workers at its fulfillment centers are paid only a tiny fraction of that. The company recently disclosed that median pay at Amazon last year was $28,446. Amazon's search for a second headquarters has also fanned criticism of the company, in large part because of the hefty tax incentives many of the 20 finalist locations have offered in an attempt to lure the company. Mr. O'Brien, the Seattle city council member, described Amazon's search as shopping around to see which city will give it the best deal. ""We need companies that want to locate in a city and are willing to work together,"" he said."
1,2018-05-03," When it comes to antitrust enforcement, one of the guiding principles is the effect on consumer prices. So the antitrust question of the moment is this: Will combining AT&T with Time Warner or Sprint with T-Mobile so diminish competition that prices go up? While regulators and a federal judge ponder that question, the great disrupter — Amazon — is already raising prices. Last week, it said its Amazon Prime service, which includes its extensive video offerings along with free shipping and other benefits, would cost $119, a 20 percent increase from the current $99. To justify the move, Amazon cited higher costs and the fact that it's only the second increase since it introduced its Prime service, for $79, in 2005. Still, Amazon's move suggests a degree of pricing power that its anxious rivals can only envy. Amazon said it now had over 100 million Prime customers, and its first-quarter profit, announced last week, jumped more than 120 percent, sending its stock price soaring. Netflix, too, has been raising prices, doing so most recently in October. As the seemingly unstoppable Amazon juggernaut rolls on, there's no doubt that media and telecommunications markets are converging and undergoing radical transformation. AT&T wants to combine its distribution channels with Time Warner's content creation, a transaction known as vertical integration because the two companies aren't direct competitors. While antitrust challenges to vertical combinations have been rare, the Trump Justice Department sued to block the AT&T-Time Warner merger on grounds that the combined companies might threaten to withhold Time Warner content to extract higher prices from rival distributors (a claim the companies have dismissed as economic nonsense). But Amazon is already vertically integrated — it creates content and distributes it over the internet. So are Netflix, Google (with YouTube) and Facebook (with its Watch feature and other offerings). Which is why the so-called FANG companies (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) loomed large at the just-completed AT&T-Time Warner trial and may well figure in a Sprint-T-Mobile decision, even though none of the technology giants is directly involved or is a party to the litigation. AT&T's chief executive, Randall Stephenson, repeatedly referred to the technology giants during the trial, and made clear that they are what drove the merger. ""The media and entertainment industry is going through some rather significant disruption,"" he testified. ""It's coming from predominately folks in the tech sector."" The Time Warner chief executive, Jeff Bewkes, made the same argument. ""They have the content, the programming, and they have the technological capability of delivering it straight to you,"" he said, adding that by ""they"" he meant the FANGs. ""And they can communicate with you about that relationship and what to watch and how to value the program."" In closing arguments this week, AT&T and Time Warner's lead trial lawyer, Daniel Petrocelli, argued that a combined company could use the kind of data about its users that is routinely collected by the tech companies to enhance its programming and offer more targeted advertising. It could use the resulting higher revenues to reduce consumer prices by what he estimated to be $500 million per year. The government's lead lawyer, Craig Conrath, provided a counterargument: ""The fact that AT&T may want to compete in some other market, that doesn't give them a free pass to reduce competition in the pay-TV market,"" he said. (The pay-TV market has traditionally included subscription TV providers, including cable and satellite, but not over-the-internet providers like Amazon and Netflix.) AT&T sees Netflix, YouTube and Amazon as ""the wolves at the door,"" said Scott Hemphill, an antitrust expert at the New York University School of Law. ""That's the center of their theory."" Time Warner's content companies, like HBO, CNN and the Turner channels, ""are just islands of content unmoored from the consumer,"" he said. Of course, the argument can be made that AT&T doesn't need to buy a company like Time Warner — it could create a media content company of its own. That's what Amazon and Netflix did, and both companies now outspend Time Warner on original programming. But from a consumer standpoint, it doesn't really matter. ""The major tech platforms are becoming vertically integrated as they create their own content to push out over their distribution platforms,"" Rich Greenfield of the investment firm BTIG wrote in a recent research note. ""In turn, is it O.K. to be vertically integrated if you build your way in, but not to buy your way into it? What if instead of an acquisition of Time Warner, AT&T just spent $8 billion a year on content creation, the way Netflix is — would that be legal, but buying Time Warner is not?"" Whether the FANG companies compete in the same markets with AT&T and Time Warner is of more than academic interest — it could well influence Judge Richard Leon's decision, which he said he would deliver no later than June 12. If Judge Leon does take such an expanded view of the market, AT&T and Time Warner would most likely prevail. Even if he does find some violations, he could impose conditions on the merger rather than block it entirely, much as Comcast had to accept conditions on its purchase of NBC Universal. Making a case that the proposed Sprint-T-Mobile merger would benefit consumers is far more difficult. The deal has drawn near-unanimous opposition from antitrust experts. The Sprint-T-Mobile tie-up, in contrast to AT&T-Time Warner, would be a horizontal merger — a combination of direct competitors, that way reducing the number of players operating in the market. Those kinds of deals have traditionally received more antitrust scrutiny. The government rejected the same merger less than four years ago, and the result was robust competition and lower prices for wireless services — exactly what antitrust regulators fervently hope for. Before that, in 2011, the government blocked a proposed merger of AT&T and T-Mobile. So the question is whether the markets in which they compete have so changed since then that a merger now wouldn't harm consumers. The two companies will need to argue that the market is no longer just the four wireless providers, but now includes the technology giants and broadband and cable companies like Comcast. A merged Sprint and T-Mobile would command only a small share of such a vastly expanded market, and wouldn't have the power to raise prices. That may arguably be the case for video, which can now be streamed over wireless handsets, but not for voice calls and texting, at least not yet. Sprint and T-Mobile are talking up the potential for 5G technology to further blur the lines between traditional markets, but widespread use of 5G is still years in the future. Courts and antitrust regulators ""don't usually consider merger defenses that depend on the existence of undeployed technology,"" said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and the Wharton School. ""Our crystal balls aren't that good. We don't have the power to gaze five years down the road, especially when it comes to fast-changing technology."" While Professor Hovenkamp said he understood the argument AT&T and Time Warner were making about Amazon, ""this whole generic idea that companies need to merge to go up against Amazon may play to a general audience, but if you take it to its logical conclusion, it could be used to validate nearly every merger."" Perhaps T-Mobile and Sprint could hold off a few years, and return with evidence that they're actually competing with the big tech companies rather than merely anticipating that competition. Then again, given the vagaries of the Trump administration's antitrust policies, ""they may feel there's no reason not to roll the dice now,"" Mr. Hovenkamp said."

1,2018-05-04," Three months after departing the Amazon series ""Transparent"" amid accusations of sexual harassment, the actor Jeffrey Tambor is poised to return to television. Mr. Tambor, who left his Emmy-winning role on ""Transparent"" after being accused of harassment by a fellow cast member and a former assistant, will appear regularly during the forthcoming season of ""Arrested Development"" on Netflix, according to a spokesman for 20th Century Fox Television, the studio behind the show. The season, the show's fifth, was filmed last year, before the allegations were made against Mr. Tambor, the spokesman said. It is not clear if there were any discussions about pulling Mr. Tambor from the show or not using the scenes in which he appeared. A Netflix spokeswoman did not immediately respond to inquiries. Mr. Tambor plays the patriarch of the Bluth family, the dysfunctional clan at the center of the show. Last year, Netflix fired Kevin Spacey from ""House of Cards"" after he faced numerous allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct. The next and final season of ""House of Cards"" will appear later this year, without Mr. Spacey. A premiere date for the new season of ""Arrested Development"" has not been announced. But Mitchell Hurwitz, the creator of the show, said this week that the return would be ""real soon."" The first three seasons of the series, which was a critical hit and beloved by its fans but struggled to find an audience, aired on Fox between 2003 and 2006.

0,2018-05-07," This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. I spent some of last week digging into the financial statements of Barnes & Noble, and I was shocked at how bad they are. Revenue from its website and from Nook (the company's e-reader) has plummeted. Sales inside its stores are falling, too. It's plausible that Barnes & Noble will not survive. Some of its problems stem from poor decisions by its management. But keep in mind that Borders — once the country's other big bookstore chain — went out of business in 2011. So some larger forces are at work here. What are they? The growing power of gigantic technology firms like Amazon. They're strong enough to create existential problems for their rivals. And as much as many of us — including me — may enjoy Amazon's service, I think it's also important to recognize the larger problems that Big Tech behemoths are causing. Amazon's growing dominance isn't good for the book business or for the country. My column this morning explains why. I hope you'll read it and, if you have thoughts, send me an email at leonhardt@nytimes.com. On the same subject, I recommend a Yale Law Review article by Lina Khan. (Don't worry: Despite being a law review article, it's well-written and easy for non-lawyers to understand.) You can also read a 2017 Times op-ed by Khan; a 2015 letter on Amazon's business practices by Authors United and the Open Markets Institute; and a story in yesterday's Times about Margrethe Vestager, a Danish regulator trying to crack down on Big Tech. The Rudy chronicles. In The Washington Post, Jennifer Rubin — herself a former lawyer —writes that Rudy Giuliani is severely out of his depth when discussing campaign-finance law.

""Trump's primary legal strategy is a public-relations one,"" Cassidy writes. Either way, the Rudy-and-Trump show has bothered even some of the president's most reliable cheerleaders, including Fox News and The Wall Street Journal's editorial board. That's in large part because ""Trump and his allies seem incapable of telling a consistent story—or even of sticking to the stories they tell,"" Politico's Jack Shafer writes.

""Which means the G.O.P. is often more popular the less it attempts to legislate at all."""
1,2018-05-07," SEATTLE — Facebook and Google are under the microscope for the ways their technologies can spread misinformation, while Amazon's growing market power is a regular target of President Trump. And Apple pioneered the modern smartphone, a device increasingly seen as too addicting. Then there's Microsoft, a giant that spent most of the 1990s and early 2000s as tech's biggest company and villain. It now seems to be auditioning for a different role: the industry's moral conscience. Among the five most valuable tech companies, Microsoft is the only one to avoid sustained public criticism about contributing to social ills in the last couple of years. At the same time, Satya Nadella, its chief executive, and Brad Smith, its president, have emerged as some of the most outspoken advocates in the industry for protecting user privacy and establishing ethical guidelines for new technology like artificial intelligence. On Monday, the conscientious side of Microsoft was on display again at Build, a three-day conference for developers in Seattle. Mr. Nadella announced a program, A.I. for Accessibility, that will award $25 million over five years to researchers, nonprofits and developers who use artificial intelligence to help people with disabilities. Mr. Nadella, whose adult son was born with cerebral palsy, has written about how his son's disability helped make him more empathetic. Echoing a theme he talked about at the conference last year, Mr. Nadella said the industry had a responsibility to build technology that empowered everyone. ""We need to ask ourselves not only what computers can do but what computers should do,"" he said. Microsoft's new role is partly due to the fact that the company isn't a major player in social media, video streaming and smartphones — the products behind the current dark mood around tech. It no longer squeezes the oxygen out of markets as Amazon can. But while the company's power has diminished since a couple of decades ago, when it controlled computing through Windows, Microsoft remains an influential voice. On Monday, its market capitalization of $733 billion made it the third most valuable technology company, behind Apple and Amazon and ahead of Google parent company, Alphabet, and Facebook. ""The irony for Microsoft is that they lost in search, they lost in social networks and they lost in mobile, and as a consequence, they have avoided the recent pushback from governments and media,"" said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. ""This has given Microsoft the freedom to take the high road as the ethical leader in technology."" Since taking the reins at Microsoft in 2014, Mr. Nadella has brought a more sensitive style of leadership to the company than his two predecessors, Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates. That shift has proved to be more suitable for Microsoft in this era. Two decades ago, Microsoft was depicted as a bully that ran roughshod over competitors in a landmark antitrust suit brought by the federal government, followed by similar cases brought by the European Union and private companies. Mr. Smith was brought in to make peace in Microsoft's antitrust battles, and Mr. Nadella was the company's first chief executive to start in the job since those suits were settled. In a phone interview, Mr. Smith, who is also Microsoft's chief legal officer, called its legal problems in past decades a ""gut-wrenching experience"" that had shaped Microsoft in its current form. ""It made Microsoft a better and more responsible company,"" he said. This year, Microsoft published a book that outlined some of the harmful effects that could come from artificial intelligence, such as bias in job recruiting. It has litigated four lawsuits against the United States government over the past five years in efforts to defend customers' privacy rights. One of them, a fight over law enforcement access to data stored in an overseas Microsoft data center, went to the Supreme Court, which dropped the case after Congress enacted a law that mooted it. ""Not only did Microsoft learn from its mistakes, Satya is a unique and caring individual,"" said Tim O'Reilly, a tech industry publisher and conference organizer. ""He understands deeply that Microsoft must help others to succeed."" The closest analog among Mr. Nadella's peers is Tim D. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, who has painted Apple as a staunch defender of its customers' privacy. He has jabbed at Facebook and Google, both advertising-supported businesses that profit from the personal data they collect from their users, a contrast to Apple's business model of selling devices. Facebook and Google, which owns YouTube, have defended their advertising businesses for allowing them to deliver services for free. They've promised to add more human moderators and invest in software tools that can screen out misinformation and other prohibited content. Mr. Cook has not turned his ire toward Microsoft, which gets most of its revenue from software, hardware and cloud computing services. The company has investments in internet services that are supported in part by advertising, including its Bing search engine and LinkedIn, the social network for professionals it acquired in 2016. Mr. Nadella has been more hesitant than Mr. Cook to publicly criticize other technology companies, turning to more subtle types of persuasion. A low-key leader, Mr. Nadella peppers his speeches and interviews with references to literature, warning that careless creators of technology could contribute to a dystopian world of George Orwell's ""1984"" or Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World."" His lieutenant, Mr. Smith, has become a ubiquitous ambassador for Microsoft on the big social issues facing technology in Washington, in Brussels and on the conference circuit. Microsoft is still occasionally cast in the role of villain. A California man who sold recycled electronic waste recently pleaded guilty for creating thousands of unauthorized discs that helped people restore the Windows operating system on refurbished PCs. The recycler, who has been sentenced to 15 months in prison, has said Microsoft supported the case against him, which was brought by federal prosecutors, because he threatened part of its business. Microsoft published a long blog post that portrayed his actions unfavorably. Still, the Microsoft of 2018 is a long way from the company that was once portrayed as a corporate predator. ""Microsoft lived through negativity that these companies are experiencing now, and it doesn't want to go back to those days,"" said Vivek Wadhwa, a distinguished fellow with Carnegie Mellon University's Silicon Valley campus. Mr. Smith of Microsoft said the greater scrutiny on the tech sector would not always fall on the same companies. ""At any given moment, there may be one or two companies in the spotlight,"" he said. ""I don't think one should assume the same one or two are always going to be in the spotlight or always on the defensive."""
0,2018-05-09," MUMBAI — Walmart said on Wednesday it reached a $16 billion deal to buy a majority stake in Flipkart, India's leading e-commerce platform, in a sizable bet on a vibrant but risky new market. The deal, struck 19 months after talks began, will plunge America's largest operator of physical retail stores into direct competition with Amazon. While Flipkart is currently the market leader, Amazon's relatively new India site is quickly closing the gap. Walmart announced that it would buy an initial stake of 77 percent in Flipkart and invest $2 billion in fresh capital into the Indian firm. The two companies said they are in continuing talks with other investors to purchase a stake, which might reduce Walmart's eventual shareholding in Flipkart. The transaction — the worst-kept secret in Indian business — is a milestone for India's internet industry. Although a handful of internet start-ups have achieved multibillion-dollar valuations on paper, this is the first time than any of them have cashed out in a big way. The benefits to Walmart are less certain. Although India's population is rapidly coming online, the number of people with enough income to shop online is still tiny. In announcing the deal, Walmart warned its shareholders that the purchase would reduce its net income by at least $750 million this year and by more than double that amount next year. Walmart's strength has always been its physical stores. It has repeatedly stumbled in its e-commerce efforts in the United States, even as Amazon has become a juggernaut responsible for nearly half of that country's online sales. Flipkart, a pioneer in services like accepting cash on delivery for online purchases, has faced its own challenges. Amazon's entry into India in 2013, backed by more than $5.5 billion in capital from the parent company, pummeled Flipkart with fast delivery, low prices and extra features such as Prime video streaming. Indeed, when Walmart first began discussions to invest in Flipkart, the Indian company was desperate for capital and willing to sell shares at a much lower price. Now, Walmart is paying a hefty premium to buy its way into the pole position in India's e-commerce market, but it has not yet outlined any strategy that would keep it ahead of Amazon there. Walmart also operates 21 wholesale stores in India that sell discounted goods to the mom-and-pop shops that dominate the retail landscape. Regulations prevent the company from opening retail stores in India like it has in the United States, but Walmart may expand its wholesale operations to ease government concerns that it wants to put the small stores out of business. Flipkart's investors and many of its employees will reap huge profits from the deal with Wal-Mart. Flipkart's co-founder, Sachin Bansal, is selling his entire 5.5 percent stake in the company, becoming an instant billionaire. Other early investors like Tiger Global and Accel will also be well rewarded for their early support. Even the SoftBank Vision Fund, the investment vehicle run by Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, will book a tidy gain despite its short time as an investor. It invested $2.5 billion in Flipkart in August, and Mr. Son told investors Wednesday that the stake will now be sold for about $4 billion."
1,2018-05-09," CHICAGO — Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is one of the most successful businessmen of all time. He has amassed an unfathomable fortune, reportedly $131 billion. This presents a predicament. Mr. Bezos commands far more money than any one person could possibly spend, far more than any one family dynasty could possibly spend. What should he do with all this money? Unfortunately, Mr. Bezos appears to have come up with a terrible response. ""The only way that I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel,"" he said in a recent interview. He has founded a company called Blue Origin that builds reusable rockets. He wants to send tourists into space and envisions a future in which heavy industry — and millions of workers — will be based out there. Mr. Bezos called Blue Origin ""incredibly important for civilization long term."" How much does Mr. Bezos plan to spend on this gonzo space adventure? He said he would start with $1 billion a year. He has every right to do that. I fear that he will go further and shoot much of his fortune into space. That would squander a staggering opportunity to serve humanity. How big is this opportunity? Ignoring inflation, let's assume that the annual investment returns to his fortune are about 5 percent. He can spend more than $6 billion every year, pretty much indefinitely. Consider a few obvious ways this money could help people here on Planet Earth: If Mr. Bezos wants to strengthen America's future scientific prowess, he could finance intensive math tutoring for about two million high school students every year — forever. Randomized trials here in Chicago indicate that such programs bring large academic benefits. They also substantially reduce racial disparities in school performance, helping to create a fairer, more prosperous America. If he wants to nourish the high-tech sector that enabled his fortune, he could endow eight M.I.T.-size universities around the world and still have billions left over. If he prefers to improve global health, he would barely break a sweat providing $1.50 eyeglasses to a nearsighted Indian schoolgirl, a farsighted Nigerian truck driver and a billion others. Or he could buy a $2 mosquito net for everyone in Africa who needs one. On top of that, he could double the International Rescue Committee's annual expenditures to assist refugees, forever. He would still have enough left over to permanently double the budgets of World Health Organization programs that address communicable diseases, health emergencies, vaccinations and other global health threats. If he wants to improve American health, he could permanently double the National Cancer Institute's budget. Or he could triple the National Institutes of Health spending on mental health, alcohol and drug addiction. Maybe he wants to improve opportunities for young people. He could provide summer jobs for one million high-risk youth across America, every year, forever. And he'd still have enough left over to open a $1,000 individual development account for every infant born in America from now on. Maybe he wants to focus on climate change. He could accelerate the march of progress by awarding large cash prizes for innovations in energy storage and other technologies. There's no doubt that Amazon's customers and employees have benefited from Mr. Bezos's entrepreneurial success. But other than his admirable stewardship of The Washington Post, he has done conspicuously less to aid humanity than have many other tycoons, even those who command far less wealth. Mr. Bezos's comments and record regarding philanthropy reflect a surprising lack of creativity and strategic vision regarding what his fortune could accomplish. If he doesn't want to be personally involved in such philanthropy, he can always outsource. He can simply follow Warren Buffett's example and write a huge check to Bill Gates, who lives barely a mile away and knows a few things about philanthropy. Over the last generation, globalization, technological advancements and regulatory policies have allowed the richest Americans to accumulate unprecedented wealth. Hey, it's a free country. As long as they follow the law, billionaires have the right to do what they want with their wealth. Certainly Mr. Bezos is entitled to follow whatever personal quest catches his fancy. But if he's talking about investing in the future of civilization, he and every other fabulously wealthy person has an accompanying obligation to be methodical and evidence-based — to do better at doing good. Mr. Bezos will be remembered as a great businessman. It's up to him whether he will be remembered as someone who used his wealth and talent to make our world a better place for his children, and for ours."

0,2018-05-10," For months, the Trump administration has rightfully been trying to thwart attempts by some European governments to impose a new corporate ""digital tax"" on American high-tech giants. This campaign to block internet-inspired extraterritorial taxation — taxation of income earned outside of a jurisdiction — is strongly supported by the American business community. But the White House, in an odd twist that turns its European Union digital tax arguments upside down, just argued before the Supreme Court that the same kind of extraterritorial taxation is acceptable when carried out by American states on retail sales on the internet. Does the left hand of the Trump administration know what the right hand is doing on internet-related tax policy? Are American corporate leaders who have ignored the issue of internet sales taxes about to suffer a key setback in relation to the European Union tax grab? And does sound tax policy go out the window if the president seems to think Amazon is in the cross hairs? The implications of tax policy for internet business models is important: Many enterprises, large and small, are adopting a range of internet-enabled services. Good principles of taxation are the same at the state, national and international levels. They include the idea that each state or country has carte blanche to tax income, sales and whatever else it wants within its borders (as long as its taxpayers are O.K. with the burden), but they should not step on the toes of other political jurisdictions by taxing activity that happens across the border. Given the eternal lure of governments to tax people who can't remove them from office (remember the old ""No taxation without representation"" mantra?), this is a timeless concern. This is the issue at the heart of the Supreme Court case South Dakota v. Wayfair, a multibillion-dollar retailer with no physical facilities in South Dakota that is using the internet to serve South Dakota customers. If South Dakota were to win this case, extraterritorial taxation would be allowed by states. Retailers would be forced to abide by every state's in-state sales tax laws regardless of whether they have any in-state business operations. This has been a goal of states for over 50 years, and it's the third time the issue has reached the Supreme Court. The result of the last visit, in 1992, is referred to in tax circles as the Quill decision. State governments want to see Quill overturned because they're eager to collect more sales tax revenues to balance their books instead of cutting spending. The desire to tax out-of-state businesses has been consistent over the decades, but the pitch is now that the internet changes everything. It makes doing business over large distances too easy, some argue, so government shouldn't be constrained by outdated considerations like borders and geographical business locations. Rather than focusing on big internet businesses, the recent oral arguments in South Dakota v. Wayfair largely revolved around the impact on small businesses and artisans using the internet. Although South Dakota targeted a few relatively large retailers with the lawsuit that reached the justices, briefs representing the interests of over a million internet-enabled small businesses and artisans were filed in the case. Chief Justice John Roberts asked government lawyers about the impact on ""micro-businesses"" because tax enforcement costs related to audits and litigation are a major concern for small businesses dealing with their own state and local tax officials. But how about when being online makes every state government the same as your local government? The internet is global. This line of reasoning points to a world where even a very small business on the internet is taxed and regulated as if it has facilities and employees everywhere in the world. On this key point, the Trump administration's Justice Department came down strongly in favor of a world where an internet presence replaces traditional physical presence. An administration that did not protect small businesses from extraterritorial internet tax claims in the Supreme Court still aspires to protect the largest United States companies from the same kind of tax policy revisionism in Europe. The issue at hand is a European Commission proposal to impose a new 3 percent tax on the gross revenue of large firms that engage in a range of commercial internet activity in Europe. What accounts for such an incoherent approach to tax policy? The administration argues in the Supreme Court that the borderless nature of e-commerce should subject someone selling potholders on Etsy or vintage Air Jordans on eBay to taxes in every state — but then it opposes European governments using the same rationale to tax billions in revenue by the largest American multinationals. Are small retailers using the internet being lost in the haze of Mr. Trump's public hostility to Amazon and Jeff Bezos? The president has regularly tweeted about Amazon ""putting many thousands of retailers out of business."" Unsurprisingly, his arguments are highly suspect. Online sales represent only 9 percent of retail. State sales tax revenues are growing in line with economic growth. Moreover, as online retail increasingly converges with traditional store retailing, most online sales already include taxes, another factor raised by Chief Justice Roberts. A further twist is that a win by South Dakota will not undermine Amazon. Its national distribution network means it must collect sales taxes in every state. New rules are likely to help the company by increasing burdens on lesser-equipped small competitors. Justices Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer both hinted at this during oral arguments, noting that expanding tax duties on the legions of smaller businesses would be likely to benefit the largest online businesses and exacerbate concerns about dominance by the few internet giants. The internet is global. It's not going away. Governments everywhere want to increase their power to tax internet commerce out of a fear that some tax revenues will go the way of music CD sales and newspaper classified ads. Mr. Trump may think he's changing the rules to increase Amazon's tax bill and help states raise more revenues, but if he succeeds it will lead to many American technology companies writing much bigger tax checks to foreign governments for years to come."
1,2018-05-10," BERKELEY, Calif. — Many people have grown accustomed to talking to their smart devices, asking them to read a text, play a song or set an alarm. But someone else might be secretly talking to them, too. Over the last two years, researchers in China and the United States have begun demonstrating that they can send hidden commands that are undetectable to the human ear to Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa and Google's Assistant. Inside university labs, the researchers have been able to secretly activate the artificial intelligence systems on smartphones and smart speakers, making them dial phone numbers or open websites. In the wrong hands, the technology could be used to unlock doors, wire money or buy stuff online — simply with music playing over the radio. A group of students from University of California, Berkeley, and Georgetown University showed in 2016 that they could hide commands in white noise played over loudspeakers and through YouTube videos to get smart devices to turn on airplane mode or open a website. This month, some of those Berkeley researchers published a research paper that went further, saying they could embed commands directly into recordings of music or spoken text. So while a human listener hears someone talking or an orchestra playing, Amazon's Echo speaker might hear an instruction to add something to your shopping list. ""We wanted to see if we could make it even more stealthy,"" said Nicholas Carlini, a fifth-year Ph.D. student in computer security at U.C. Berkeley and one of the paper's authors. [Read more on what Alexa can hear when brought into your home] Mr. Carlini added that while there was no evidence that these techniques have left the lab, it may only be a matter of time before someone starts exploiting them. ""My assumption is that the malicious people already employ people to do what I do,"" he said. These deceptions illustrate how artificial intelligence — even as it is making great strides — can still be tricked and manipulated. Computers can be fooled into identifying an airplane as a cat just by changing a few pixels of a digital image, while researchers can make a self-driving car swerve or speed up simply by pasting small stickers on road signs and confusing the vehicle's computer vision system. With audio attacks, the researchers are exploiting the gap between human and machine speech recognition. Speech recognition systems typically translate each sound to a letter, eventually compiling those into words and phrases. By making slight changes to audio files, researchers were able to cancel out the sound that the speech recognition system was supposed to hear and replace it with a sound that would be transcribed differently by machines while being nearly undetectable to the human ear. The proliferation of voice-activated gadgets amplifies the implications of such tricks. Smartphones and smart speakers that use digital assistants like Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri are set to outnumber people by 2021, according to the research firm Ovum. And more than half of all American households will have at least one smart speaker by then, according to Juniper Research. Amazon said that it doesn't disclose specific security measures, but it has taken steps to ensure its Echo smart speaker is secure. Google said security is an ongoing focus and that its Assistant has features to mitigate undetectable audio commands. Both companies' assistants employ voice recognition technology to prevent devices from acting on certain commands unless they recognize the user's voice. Apple said its smart speaker, HomePod, is designed to prevent commands from doing things like unlocking doors, and it noted that iPhones and iPads must be unlocked before Siri will act on commands that access sensitive data or open apps and websites, among other measures. Yet many people leave their smartphones unlocked, and, at least for now, voice recognition systems are notoriously easy to fool. There is already a history of smart devices being exploited for commercial gains through spoken commands. Last year, Burger King caused a stir with an online ad that purposely asked 'O.K., Google, what is the Whopper burger?"" Android devices with voice-enabled search would respond by reading from the Whopper's Wikipedia page. The ad was canceled after viewers started editing the Wikipedia page to comic effect. [Read more on how we may soon be living in Alexa's world] A few months later, the animated series South Park followed up with an entire episode built around voice commands that caused viewers' voice-recognition assistants to parrot adolescent obscenities. There is no American law against broadcasting subliminal messages to humans, let alone machines. The Federal Communications Commission discourages the practice as ""counter to the public interest,"" and the Television Code of the National Association of Broadcasters bans ""transmitting messages below the threshold of normal awareness."" Neither say anything about subliminal stimuli for smart devices. Courts have ruled that subliminal messages may constitute an invasion of privacy, but the law has not extended the concept of privacy to machines. Now the technology is racing even further ahead of the law. Last year, researchers at Princeton University and China's Zhejiang University demonstrated that voice-recognition systems could be activated by using frequencies inaudible to the human ear. The attack first muted the phone so the owner wouldn't hear the system's responses, either. The technique, which the Chinese researchers called DolphinAttack, can instruct smart devices to visit malicious websites, initiate phone calls, take a picture or send text messages. While DolphinAttack has its limitations — the transmitter must be close to the receiving device — experts warned that more powerful ultrasonic systems were possible. That warning was borne out in April, when researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign demonstrated ultrasound attacks from 25 feet away. While the commands couldn't penetrate walls, they could control smart devices through open windows from outside a building. This year, another group of Chinese and American researchers from China's Academy of Sciences and other institutions, demonstrated they could control voice-activated devices with commands embedded in songs that can be broadcast over the radio or played on services like YouTube. More recently, Mr. Carlini and his colleagues at Berkeley have  incorporated commands into audio recognized by Mozilla's DeepSpeech voice-to-text translation software, an open-source platform. They were able to hide the command, ""O.K. Google, browse to evil.com"" in a recording of the spoken phrase, ""Without the data set, the article is useless."" Humans cannot discern the command.

0,2018-05-11," The latest picture by the prolific and ever-stimulating filmmaker Spike Lee, ""BlacKkKlansman,"" is in competition at the Cannes Film Festival. His other 2018 movie, ""Pass Over,"" is on Amazon Video and free to Prime members. It's a superb film, one that, as the saying goes, finds the director working at the height of his powers. (It's also a rare instance of an Amazon production debuting on the video site with no theatrical release.) ""Pass Over"" is an adaptation of a play by Antoinette Nwandu, produced at the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago, where it was directed by Danya Taymor. I call it an adaptation even though it is, in large part, a film of the play, shot during a stage performance, and featuring glimpses of audience members laughing or gasping during crucial scenes. Mr. Lee's movie begins with a group boarding a bus bound for the Steppenwolf. A shot of the corner of Martin Luther King Drive and 64th Street in Chicago, in daylight, changes in a match cut to the prop street sign on the stage. At the foot of the sign, Kitch (Julian Parker) frets while Moses (Jon Michael Hill) sleeps. When Moses wakes, these two young African-American men contemplate, with a lot of profanity, the aimlessness of their lives while trying to dodge stray bullets. ""I got plans, you hear me? Big ole plans,"" one of them boasts. While their dialogue is stocked with allusions to redemption, their despair is such that the place they wish to ""pass over"" is revealed as the valley of death. The question becomes how to break the death spiral the characters feel trapped in. Mr. Lee shoots the stage from various intimate angles. His techniques here explode the notion of a ""filmed play."" He puts you with the characters, but also puts you with the audience; it's a multidimensional experience, with emotional resonances that once seemed unique to either theatrical or cinematic form. It is a remarkable and remarkably pertinent movie. ""Pass Over' is a fiction informed by actual events. ""Stranger Fruit"" is a documentary about one of those events. ""They shot that boy because they wanted to shoot that boy"" is the blunt conclusion of one of the interviewees in this documentary by Jason Pollock about the  killing of Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014 The movie is available on VOD; it will air on Starz on June 18 and will be streamable on the Starz app. This version of the film is a new one; when the picture was shown at the 2017 South by Southwest film festival, it contained previously unreleased surveillance camera footage of the convenience store that Mr. Brown visited the day before his shooting. The director's interpretation of the newly released footage caused some controversy, eliciting pushback from Ferguson officials and some media commentators. Mr. Pollock has expanded the film to take that controversy into account. The expanded version is slightly awkward, since Mr. Pollock leaves in the part of the film in which he calls the surveillance footage that was released by the police in the aftermath of Mr. Brown's death ""completely irrelevant."" There are several nits one can pick with this movie. Mr. Pollock's narration, particularly in the beginning, is prosaic. I found myself thinking more than once that contemporary documentary filmmakers interested in social justice would do better to aspire to Marcel Ophuls. Yet ""Stranger Fruit"" does tell a disturbing story and is frequently pretty smart in how it does so. Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager, was shot several times after a confrontation with a police officer, Darren Wilson, his body left on the street for hours after his death. In the wake of the shooting, local police presented narratives intended to cast aspersions on Mr. Brown's character and lay out a coherent rationale for his death. Mr. Pollock conducts several compelling interviews and has good ears and eyes for revealing juxtapositions. Mr. Wilson's protestation that ""You can't perform the duties of a police officer and have racism in you"" finds a devastating counterpoint in archival footage of a speech by Malcolm X in which he says, ""The police are able to use the press to make the white person think that 90 to 99 percent of the Negroes are criminals."" IN THE EARLY PART of this century there seemed to be a miniboom in low-budget filmmaking in the United States The most publicity went to a loose affiliation of directors sometimes grouped under the term ""Mumblecore."" One of them, the Alejandro Adams, based in California's Bay Area, produced work during this period that was too prickly and individual to categorize under any rubric. His feature films (four, so far) were recently put up on Amazon Video and are free for Prime members. (Three of these films were written with Marya Murphy, who also appears as a performer in two of the films, and was a co-producer of all of them.) ""Around the Bay,"" Mr. Adams's first film, is a portrait of a dysfunctional family that possesses, as the critic Vadim Rizov has observed, some of the rough power of a Maurice Pialat movie. ""Canary,"" Mr. Adams's next picture, is a slightly futuristic scenario about the marketing schemes of a firm selling human organs. It has conceptual hints of Godard's ""Alphaville"" and a chilly through-line concerning the banality of human awfulness. Mr. Adams's observations on this topic are applied to an oblique thriller framework in ""Babnik,"" about a Russian immigrant in California whose gambling debts put him in a tricky position: The other Russians he owes want him to make good on the debt by kidnapping a teenage girl — the men are also sex traffickers. Finally, in his 2012 film ""Amity,"" Mr. Adams plumbs the depths of toxic masculinity. The movie is about Greg, an aggressive Navy vet who attempts to reconnect with his teenage daughter by meeting her in a limo on the night of her high-school graduation. She rebuffs him, and Greg's evening turns into one of abrasive frustration as he verbally jousts with his driver and a group of women he picks up with the limo later that evening. It's a tense and uncomfortable experience, in all the right ways. Mr. Adams has a deceptive style; initially his films seem loosely shot, but the aggregation of seemingly tossed-off scenes tightens like a noose. The director has informed me that he's working on some new projects; I do hope they come to fruition. In the meantime, this is a distinctive and provocative body of work."
0,2018-05-15," SEATTLE — After intense lobbying by local businesses and a bold threat by Amazon to curtail development in its hometown, the Seattle City Council on Monday approved a smaller and more limited tax on big companies than originally envisioned. The new tax — dubbed the ""Amazon Tax"" by locals — will fund affordable housing and homeless services in a city whose economic boom, driven in no small part by Amazon, has priced many residents out of the area and forced some onto the streets. Amazon, which halted two major expansion projects in Seattle in protest over the larger tax increase, said it was disappointed even with the smaller tax package, although the company said it would restart the planning process for one of its new buildings. It was still exploring the possibility of subleasing a second building that a developer is currently building. The council had originally considered an annual ""head"" tax of $500 per full-time employee for Amazon and other large employers, but the amended measure that passed reduced that figure to $275. Instead of the $75 million a year the tax was originally expected to raise, it will bring in less than $50 million. The council also included a sunset provision that would require the tax to be reauthorized in five years. The compromise failed to defuse tensions between Amazon and the city it has called home for the last 24 years. Even though the company decided to resume one of its building projects, Drew Herdener, an Amazon vice president, said in a statement, ""We remain very apprehensive about the future created by the council's hostile approach and rhetoric toward larger businesses, which forces us to question our growth here."" But the company's tactics in Seattle has also garnered concern among other cities bidding to bring Amazon's second headquarters to town. Twenty finalist locations across North America have been aggressively wooing Amazon to win up to 50,000 high-paying jobs that its second headquarters would bring. In some of those places, there is opposition growing over the tax incentives that some city and state governments have agreed to give Amazon in return for being selected. And Amazon's hardball politics in Seattle has further soured some local leaders. ""I absolutely find it unacceptable to see politically threatening behavior as is occurring there,"" said Robin Kniech, a member of the City Council in Denver, one of the finalists for Amazon's second headquarters. ""It certainly doesn't send a message that you expect to be a part of the community."" Ms. Kniech was one of more than 50 local lawmakers in the United States who sent an open letter to Seattle leaders and residents on Monday supporting the tax and criticizing Amazon's resistance to it. ""By threatening Seattle over this tax, Amazon is sending a message to all of our cities: we play by our own rules,"" the letter said. The unanimous vote in favor of the amended tax proposal occurred at a raucous public meeting at which advocates for the homeless and affordable housing — some holding placards saying ""Tax Amazon"" — argued in favor of a stiffer tax on the company and other businesses. Representatives of businesses warned that the tax would drive employers out of town, while others speakers questioned whether Seattle's city government could be trusted to spend the additional tax revenue wisely. Mr. Hederner, the Amazon vice president, said sharp increases in the city of Seattle's revenues have outpaced the population growth of the city during the same period. ""The city does not have a revenue problem — it has a spending efficiency problem,"" he said. ""We are highly uncertain whether the City Council's anti-business positions or its spending inefficiency will change for the better."" The lower tax was the result of feverish negotiations over the weekend between members of the City Council and Seattle's mayor, Jenny Durkan, who had opposed the council's earlier tax proposal. The mayor had publicly hinted that she would veto the original tax proposal because of the risks she said it posed to the local economy. Several members of the nine-person City Council said they were reluctantly voting in favor of the smaller tax because there were not enough votes to override a mayoral veto of the larger tax plan."
0,2018-05-16," SEATTLE — Amazon Prime is the kitchen sink of membership programs. The internet retailer keeps cramming new benefits into it — music and video streaming, fast shipping and online photo storage. Next up: ridiculously inexpensive halibut steaks from Whole Foods. On Wednesday, the company will unveil the next stage of its step-by-step makeover of Whole Foods Markets, the grocery chain it acquired last year, with a collection of store discounts aimed at Prime members. Whole Foods customers who are also Prime members will get 10 percent off hundreds of sale items in stores, including tilapia, organic baby kale and chicken breasts. Amazon is rolling out the discounts in Whole Foods stores in Florida on Wednesday and will expand them to across the country starting this summer. It's also offering Prime members much deeper discounts on a handful of items that will change weekly, some of which are eye-catching. For instance, this week in Florida, wild-caught halibut steaks will be $9.99 a pound, about half the regular price. One pound of organic strawberries will be $2.99, or $2 less than usual. Customers who buy one 12-pack of 365 Everyday Value sparkling water will get a second one for free. ""I think this is one of the most important launches we've had for Prime since Prime Video,"" Cem Sibay, vice president of Amazon Prime, said in an interview. Amazon has already fiddled with prices at Whole Foods to refashion its image as wallet-busting seller of healthy foods. It has made seasonal and permanent discounts on some items for all customers, not just those who subscribe to Prime. Prime members who use an Amazon-branded Visa card get 5 percent cash back on all their Whole Foods purchases, while also getting two-hour home delivery of Whole Foods groceries through the company's Prime Now service. Amazon has more than 100 million Prime customers worldwide and recently announced that it would increase the membership fee for the service, to $119 a year from $99, to pay for all the new benefits it is adding to it. Sucharita Kodali, an analyst at Forrester Research, said the discounts were likely to hurt the profit margins at Whole Foods — but that was besides the point if the move strengthens Prime, a major focus of Amazon these days. ""I don't know that it will be great from a profitability standpoint, but I don't know that they really care,"" she said. ""It's more customer engagement and customer satisfaction. Maybe it gets them more Prime customers, more Whole Foods usage and more units per cart."""
0,2018-05-17," Walmart, hoping to quell investors' fears that its strategy for competing with Amazon had veered off course, said on Thursday that its e-commerce push was back on track in the year's first quarter. Online sales rose 33 percent in the first three months of 2018, helping to drive the retailer's overall revenue above analysts' expectations. The increase in e-commerce sales, while slower than in previous quarters, improved on the 23 percent growth rate that Walmart reported at the end of 2017. The company recently redesigned its flagship website, though Walmart said it was too early to quantify how much the redesign was helping to generate new sales. ""We are really encouraged by our progress and execution this quarter,"" Marc Lore, the head of Walmart's e-commerce business in the United States, said in a conference call. Investors were unimpressed by the results. Despite the fact that the company's adjusted earnings per share of $1.14 beat analysts expectations of $1.12, Walmart's stock price was down by more than 1.8 percent in early afternoon trading on Thursday. The company is trying to offer all things to all shoppers as it tries to counter Amazon's online dominance — a nice physical store to shop in, an easy-to-use website and fast home delivery. ""This whole converged experience we think is really important,"" said Greg Foran, the head of Walmart's operations in the United States. It is an expensive proposition. For a company with a long history of squeezing expenses from its stores, Walmart's operating profit is now under pressure, as it makes investments in both e-commerce and in improving its big boxes. Earlier this year, the company raised its starting wage to $11 an hour to better compete for workers in the tightening labor market. One bright spot for e-commerce sales was online grocery pickup, which allows customers to order online and pick up their food at the store. Walmart is also increasing home deliveries of groceries. This week, Amazon made its own chess move, announcing special discounts for its Prime members when they shop at Whole Foods Markets. A big question facing Walmart — and other brick-and-mortar retailers scrambling to build out their online capabilities — is how much e-commerce sales are cannibalizing transactions that would have otherwise been made in its stores. The extra cost of home delivery cuts into the margins on each sale. Analysts say the company needs to find new customers now that its more than 5,000 Walmart and Sam's Club stores have largely saturated most of the United States. Last week, Walmart announced it was spending $16 billion to acquire a controlling stake in Flipkart, India's leading e-commerce site. With more than 300 million tech-savvy millennials, India is an enticing market for Walmart. But the push into India is also fraught with risks, given the country's problematic infrastructure and the reality that much of the population can barely afford basic necessities. Closer to home, Walmart is also trying to reach younger, urban and more affluent online shoppers, who have long been more of Amazon's core customer base than Walmart's. Mr. Lore said that Jet.com, an e-commerce site that Walmart acquired for $3.3 billion two years ago, is trying to make inroads in markets like New York City and San Francisco where Walmart has few, if any, stores. Jet, for example, recently started offering a larger range of Apple products. Walmart's more mainstream website is trying to expand its higher end brands also. In the coming weeks, the website will start selling about 125 brands from Lord & Taylor — a partnership model that Mr. Lore said the company was ""aggressively pursuing."""
1,2018-05-17," NEWPORT, R.I. — Long before Peter Blake was killed by a Brazilian pirate in the Amazon in 2001, he talked at the dinner table with his young son James about the privileges that came with successfully sailing around the world. ""He always told me that you couldn't put your elbows on the table until you've gone around Cape Horn,"" James Blake said. Blake, now 31, has joined the club at last: rounding ""the Horn"" this year during the Volvo Ocean Race, the grueling round-the-world event that his father competed in five times — and won once — when it was called the Whitbread. The Volvo started Oct. 22 with seven teams sailing from Alicante, Spain, to Lisbon. The race has 11 legs total with the ninth starting Sunday and the teams sailing from Newport to Cardiff, Wales. The race is scheduled to finish in The Hague in late June. Blake is in the midst of his first participation, and he is playing a very different role than his father, who was a skipper and central figure worldwide in yachting until his death at age 53. Blake is an onboard reporter, or OBR — one of 10 men and women hired by the race to deliver video, photography and written material from the boats. The OBRs are, by job definition, fly-on-the-deck observers and are not permitted to help with the performance of the yachts (although they can do lots of cooking). But impartiality can prove elusive when you share very cramped quarters and the perils of ocean racing during legs that can stretch to 7,600 nautical miles and last more than 20 days. ""The most important thing is telling the story, but it's a fine line we all have to dance between telling the good, the bad and the ugly,"" Corinna Halloran, a former onboard reporter, once said. That dance, never straightforward since embedded reporting became part of the Volvo in 2008, has been particularly challenging during this edition of the race, which has twice turned tragic. In January, a fisherman was killed after the Danish-American team, Vestas 11th Hour Racing, collided with a Chinese fishing boat. Then in March, John Fisher, a British sailor with the Hong Kong-based team Sun Hung Kai/Scallywag, was lost at sea and presumed dead after being swept overboard about 1,400 nautical miles west of Cape Horn. Largely for legal reasons, the race released little detailed information from on board Vestas after the January incident. Konrad Frost, the OBR on Scallywag during the fatal leg in March, stopped reporting after it became clear that Fisher had been lost. ""Konrad is a very experienced cameraman, and it was his judgment on what should and should not be captured,"" said Brian Carlin, the OBR team leader. ""Konrad stood down and did not continue, and I think that was only right."" Fisher's loss was an emotional blow. ""It's definitely been a big shock to everyone,"" Blake said. ""My initial thoughts were just with his family, because I have a little bit of experience with what they are going through."" Blake was 14 when his father was killed during an environmental research mission. The society's yacht, Seamaster, was anchored in Macapa near the mouth of the Amazon delta when a small band of masked river pirates came aboard with guns drawn and balaclavas in place. Peter Blake, in an attempt to protect his crew, fired a rifle and was shot twice in the back by Ricardo Colares Tavares, who was later sentenced to 36 years in prison in Brazil for the murder. Peter Blake became an icon in New Zealand, where sailing is an intermittent national obsession. He was imposing with a bushy mustache, and though plenty of Kiwi sailors won more regattas, he had a rumpled charisma and persistence. He finally won the Whitbread on his fifth attempt, sweeping all six legs during the 1989-90 edition as skipper of Steinlager 2. After managing an unsuccessful challenge for the 1992 America's Cup, he was the syndicate head in 1995 when Team New Zealand won yachting's most prestigious trophy for the first time. He played the same role off the water again in 2000 when the team successfully defended the Cup at home in Auckland. During those campaigns, his lucky red socks became a national symbol (and fund-raising vehicle), worn by Prime Minister Jim Bolger and other New Zealanders in honor of a small nation's ability to punch above its weight. James' older sister, Sarah-Jane, is an artist who is married to Alistair Moore, one of Peter Blake's former crew members on Seamaster. James and Sarah-Jane grew up sailing with their father and British mother, Pippa, on family cruises in places like New Zealand's Bay of Islands and Scotland's west coast. He holds dual British-New Zealand citizenship but was raised and educated mainly in the United Kingdom, where he remains based when he is not being buffeted by winds and doused by seawater with a camera or drone control in hand. ""These boats are very, very wet,"" James said. ""Sometimes it just feels like you are underwater."" Blake might not be an offshore racer, but he shares his father's adventurous streak. In 2012 he rowed from Australia to New Zealand with three companions, losing about 40 pounds during the 51 days it took to complete the crossing. He and a friend are attempting to develop a foiling kite boat to make a trans-Atlantic crossing. A cameraman by trade, he has focused, until now, on wildlife and historical documentaries, including work on the British polar explorer Ernest Shackleton. ""I've never really covered sport before,"" Blake said. ""Lots of sharks and whales, but this popped up, and it's a bit of a challenge really. I like filming expeditions and people going through a bit of hardship, so for me this has been a chance to look into that basically, and it's also been quite nice from a personal point of view seeing what Dad went through."" He was encouraged to apply for the Volvo OBR role by Leon Sefton, head of television and video for the race. Sefton is the son of Alan Sefton, a former journalist who became Peter Blake's biographer and aide-de-camp. The family connection surely did not hurt in making the final cut among the 140 candidates who made it through the initial vetting process. ""The Blake family is always an important part of this race, but James got here on his merits as a cameraman,"" Carlin said. ""It's just an added bonus that he happens to be Sir Peter Blake's son."" The OBRs rotate from crew to crew in this edition, and Blake has sailed with three different teams during the first eight legs of this race. He was aboard Dutch entrant Team AkzoNobel for the third leg from Cape Town to Melbourne, Australia, when the boat's mast track broke in December amid 50-knot squalls. ""We're in the middle of absolutely nowhere and you see this dip in how everyone is feeling, like we're screwed basically,"" Blake said. ""And I'd say within five minutes everyone was back up and running. There was a game plan, the humor was back and everyone got on with it, so that will really stick with me."" But the highlight so far for Blake was rounding the Horn: documenting the huge seas and seeing the albatrosses his father spoke about so often. ""You see these birds that put no apparent effort into being down there, and we're 10 men and women in a boat struggling just to stay afloat,"" Blake said. ""And you see them flying around up there, and you wonder what they're thinking of you. It's quite amusing."" Blake and the rest of the crew did manage to stay afloat, and when they arrived in Itajai, Brazil, in March they made their way to a restaurant to celebrate the return to terra firma. ""It was a nice meal out,"" Blake said. ""And everyone was putting their elbows on the table."""
0,2018-05-18," The name of Tig Notaro's new Netflix comedy special, ""Happy to Be Here,"" could be taken as sarcasm given her ups and downs over the last year. Ms. Notaro made headlines last fall for swinging hard at her most famous champion, Louis C.K., in an episode of her lauded Amazon series, ""One Mississippi."" It featured a male boss masturbating in front of a female underling, the very act that Louis C.K., an executive producer of the show, would end up being accused of and admitting to. Then in January, her show was canceled. Yet Ms. Notaro, who came to fame for mining her bilateral breast-cancer diagnosis for humor, and then baring her chest, post-double mastectomy, onstage, says ""Happy to Be Here,"" due Tuesday, is a genuine celebration of newfound joy. She spoke with me this week by phone from her home in Los Angeles, which she shares with her wife, Stephanie Allynne, and their twin boys, who are nearly 2. Here are edited excerpts from our conversation. There's a real sweetness to this special. I was struck that there was no mention of #MeToo, which was very fresh when the special was filmed. Was that a conscious choice?  It came from my life and my marriage and my children and my good health. It was just a very personal joy that inspired it. Obviously I'm aware of and have been  speaking out about events going on in the world outside of my personal life. I consider ""Happy to Be Here"" the final piece of a trilogy. When I released ""Live"" [her 2012 special], I was right in the middle of a lot of physical and emotional pain. ""Boyish Girl Interrupted"" [2015] was me crawling out of the rubble, trying to get footing in the world, getting together with Steph and coming to terms with my body. ""Happy to Be Here"" is one of the first things I say onstage. And I am happier than I've ever been. There was a real outcry after ""One Mississippi"" was canceled. Are there any chances of it being revived?  We would have very gladly done another season if given a chance. There's also something really nice about moving on from a show that had been tied to such a negative person who was producing it, even though before the pilot was shot, I was trying to distance myself from him. It was certainly like, ""Oh that's a bummer,"" but it was also a relief. Any chances of doing another show? I just want to do things that come naturally and feel good. I don't want to be, ""Ugh, I want to get another show out there."" I don't feel that way at all. My wife, Stephanie, and I really love working together; we've been developing and writing other projects. We have one particular very, very big project that should be announced any second. [The project they are writing, ""Hail to the Chief,"" a forthcoming Netflix film starring Jennifer Aniston as the president and Ms. Notaro as her wife, the first lady, was announced Friday.] Regarding that negative person — Louis C.K. — how did it affect things at Amazon? He wasn't involved, but his name was on it. That brought a lot of power, even if he wasn't working on it day to day. His people were involved day to day. I do want to give credit to Amazon. Amazon let us make exactly the show we wanted to make. Any examples of how that power was exerted? I don't want to go much into it. But one of the most powerful people in comedy was executive producer on the show, and the networks and studios were excited to have him. I meanwhile had found out he's not who I thought he was, and so I wanted that separation. You played a prominent role in bringing forth revelations about Louis C.K.'s misbehavior with women, both on your show and in subsequent interviews. What is your opinion of what happened to him and how the #MeToo movement unfolded?  We were in production on a TV show that was trying to crack that open and have that discussion and have the light shining on this behavior. Nobody in the ""One Mississippi"" writers' room thought for a second that this was being teed up at the same time as this huge movement was about to rear its head. We were shocked, and we were elated. I hope it continues. There are different signs that this is not stopping. I don't think that anger and frustration and those feelings can go away. I hope they don't. The attention and support for the victims needs to be continued, more than people worried about these abusers and what's next for them, how are they going to move on — shut up. What do you make of talk about if or how these disgraced men should come back? You know what? If any of these people come back, I would say, ""I can't wait to see who is actually going to support them."" That is going to be the glaring horror. Who is going to be, like, ""This is a pressing issue, and we need to get them back?"" If a janitor was so great at cleaning the building but also tended to masturbate in front of people, would the people at that building be like, ""Yes, he masturbated, but I've never seen anyone clean so thoroughly, and I was just wondering when he's going to get his job back, he's so good at it."" No, it would be, ""That's not acceptable."" It's fame and power that people are blinded by. Do you see yourself as having played a significant role in bringing his misdeeds to light? Did you get support afterward? No, I think it's just having knowledge that there's an abusive person, and I knew several people in that article. They're friends of mine, and I know the utter hell — utter hell — they've been put through. I don't need public support and I'm not doing it for that, but I did get private texts and emails from people. How, from your point of view, has the comedy scene embraced or pushed back against #MeToo?  Every time I turn around I'm surprised. You think somebody is the most progressive, powerful person and then they're like: ""Well, this guy didn't really do much. It's not Harvey Weinstein."" Yes, but put yourself in the mind-set of somebody walking around masturbating in front of people. Who is that? Who is that person doing this? One of the people that really has impressed me — and it's not like I'm discovering an unknown talent — is Samantha Bee. She's an unwavering voice that I hope doesn't go away. One of the things we have heard from some of the women who came forth about what happened to them with Louis C.K. was how little the comedy world supported them, with you being a notable exception. Why do you think that was? I think people are friends with him and know he might be back. I think that's an unfortunate thing that controls people."

He wasn't involved, but his name was on it. That brought a lot of power, even if he wasn't working on it day to day. His people were involved day to day. I do want to give credit to Amazon. Amazon let us make exactly the show we wanted to make. Any examples of how that power was exerted? I don't want to go much into it. But one of the most powerful people in comedy was executive producer on the show, and the networks and studios were excited to have him. I meanwhile had found out he's not who I thought he was, and so I wanted that separation. You played a prominent role in bringing forth revelations about Louis C.K.'s misbehavior with women, both on your show and in subsequent interviews. What is your opinion of what happened to him and how the #MeToo movement unfolded?  We were in production on a TV show that was trying to crack that open and have that discussion and have the light shining on this behavior. Nobody in the ""One Mississippi"" writers' room thought for a second that this was being teed up at the same time as this huge movement was about to rear its head. We were shocked, and we were elated. I hope it continues. There are different signs that this is not stopping. I don't think that anger and frustration and those feelings can go away. I hope they don't. The attention and support for the victims needs to be continued, more than people worried about these abusers and what's next for them, how are they going to move on — shut up. What do you make of talk about if or how these disgraced men should come back? You know what? If any of these people come back, I would say, ""I can't wait to see who is actually going to support them."" That is going to be the glaring horror. Who is going to be, like, ""This is a pressing issue, and we need to get them back?"" If a janitor was so great at cleaning the building but also tended to masturbate in front of people, would the people at that building be like, ""Yes, he masturbated, but I've never seen anyone clean so thoroughly, and I was just wondering when he's going to get his job back, he's so good at it."" No, it would be, ""That's not acceptable."" It's fame and power that people are blinded by. Do you see yourself as having played a significant role in bringing his misdeeds to light? Did you get support afterward? No, I think it's just having knowledge that there's an abusive person, and I knew several people in that article. They're friends of mine, and I know the utter hell — utter hell — they've been put through. I don't need public support and I'm not doing it for that, but I did get private texts and emails from people. How, from your point of view, has the comedy scene embraced or pushed back against #MeToo?  Every time I turn around I'm surprised. You think somebody is the most progressive, powerful person and then they're like: ""Well, this guy didn't really do much. It's not Harvey Weinstein."" Yes, but put yourself in the mind-set of somebody walking around masturbating in front of people. Who is that? Who is that person doing this? One of the people that really has impressed me — and it's not like I'm discovering an unknown talent — is Samantha Bee. She's an unwavering voice that I hope doesn't go away. One of the things we have heard from some of the women who came forth about what happened to them with Louis C.K. was how little the comedy world supported them, with you being a notable exception. Why do you think that was? I think people are friends with him and know he might be back. I think that's an unfortunate thing that controls people."
2,2018-05-18," If President Trump resumes his fight with Amazon, the ultimate loser is clear: It will be the American economy. Economists are a disputatious bunch, but across the political spectrum we agree on one thing: Politicians shouldn't be attacking specific companies based on their own whims or preferences. The president has attacked Amazon on two fronts. First, he asserted that Amazon has avoided paying taxes. Second, he claimed that the United States Postal Service loses money delivering Amazon's packages. These claims have been fact-checked and their merits argued at length. They do not stand up to close scrutiny. But putting the factual basis of these claims aside, there is another problem that may even be even bigger: The president was unnecessarily specific about a single company. Some economic interventions necessarily pinpoint particular companies. When talking about the major credit rating agencies, for example, it's hard to avoid talking about the big three: Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch. That isn't the case here. The issues the president raised about Amazon actually apply to large parts of the economy. For example, every retail transaction on the web raises the thorny issue of how to handle local sales taxes. But Amazon itself collects taxes for 45 states and the District of Columbia. Some retailers do not even do that. For example, the online store owned by the Trump Organization, Trumpstore.com collects taxes only on orders shipped to three states. But Mr. Trump has not complained about that store, or about most others. He does not appear to be fostering a policy discussion about local sales taxes in a connected economy; instead there is reason to suspect that the president has used his political muscle to target a firm he simply dislikes. Shortly after he began attacking Amazon on Twitter, the president issued an executive order demanding that the Postal Service review its finances. As The Times has reported, while that order made no mention of Amazon, it appeared that he was seeking ""to substantiate his repeated claim that the financial arrangement between the Postal Service and Amazon, its biggest shipper of packages, is a money loser."" Political interference in markets is always dangerous. But when it is narrowly targeted, it is particularly so. First, such interference creates unclear rules. Any sports fan knows the frustration of watching a game with arbitrary and unpredictable refereeing. Consistency is equally important for a well-functioning economy. Capricious refereeing complicates managerial decision-making. It distorts cost-benefit calculations, delaying decisions and wasting resources. Second, political targeting opens the door to various forms of corruption. When politicians play an outsized role in the economy, companies must curry their favor. This is obvious in many countries, particularly poor ones, where politicians interfere heavily in local economies by deciding such matters as which companies will get a license to operate and which will be audited by the tax authority. Managers must focus as much effort on catering to politicians as to customers, not just through campaign contributions but through bribes, both subtle and overt. These incentives don't merely warp the economy. They alter the political sphere, too. Companies have many tools at their disposal when they seek to influence politicians. A few weeks before an election, a company seeking to help a candidate can announce a major plant opening. Or it can cut prices in response to a politician's entreaties. In France, one study found that politically connected chief executives created jobs and opened factories when doing so would help local politicians win re-election. Another study found that American companies have directed their philanthropy to gain favor with congressmen. Taken to an extreme, political favor can become a corporate asset, one that easily depreciates in value. Raymond Fisman, now an economist at Boston University, demonstrated this by studying corporate performance during President Suharto's 32-year dictatorship in Indonesia. Professor Fisman found that when Suharto's health was reported to be poor, the shares of companies most closely linked to the ultimate leader declined the most sharply. As Professor Fisman put it, ""A large percentage of a well connected firm's value may be derived from political connections."" I am not saying that the United States in 2018 is equivalent to Suharto's Indonesia. In fact, a 2012 study by Professor Fisman and several colleagues, showed that political connections are not as valuable in the United States as they were in Indonesia. The American study used the same methodology and applied it to companies connected to the former Vice President Dick Cheney. Stock prices of such companies did not budge when his political fortunes rose — as when he was first chosen as the vice-presidential candidate — or when his health was impaired while in office. The heartening truth is that until now, the United States has, by and large, done a good job of insulating the economy from political interference. Should that insulation wear down, though, we will find ourselves in a troubling world. That's why President Trump's campaign against Amazon is worthy of continuing scrutiny. Moreover, the president's motivation for focusing on Amazon is open to question. One plausible hypothesis is that Jeff Bezos, the company's founder, owns The Washington Post, which has unflinchingly reported on the Trump presidency. It is noteworthy that the president often refers to The Washington Post as The ""Amazon Washington Post."" Any possible interference with freedom of the press endangers the economy — and much more. An efficient economy — and a democracy — requires uniform application of the law. We live in partisan times. But we all can root for the rule of law. It's not a particularly exciting cause, but it is in dire need of supporters."
0,2018-05-22," Madidi National Park in Bolivia goes from lowland to mountaintop, from 600 feet to almost 20,000 feet above sea level. It covers more than 7,000 square miles of wildly different habitats. It is, says Rob Wallace, an ecologist with the Wildlife Conservation Society in Bolivia, ""a place where the Amazon meets the Andes.""   It has cloud forests, lowland jungle, rivers, streams, wetlands. It even has glaciers. ""Madidi was put together on the hypothesis that it could be the world's most biologically diverse protected area,"" Dr. Wallace said. And, he said, it is — for mammals, birds, plants and butterflies.  In June 2015, a team of scientists, almost all Bolivian, set out on a three-year survey of life in the park, concentrating on 15 sites. The on-the-ground search, supported by the conservation society, was complemented by a less adventurous investigation — of the scientific literature. The goal of the project, Identidad Madidi, was to identify as many species that lived in the park as they could.  The results are in: The total number of species documented for Madidi is now 8,524. The team in the field found about 4,000 species, 1,362 of them never before recorded in Madidi. They estimate, based on other information of how species are distributed, that there are probably 11,395 living in the park, even though some of those have not yet been spotted. That includes all creatures with backbones, all plants and butterflies. Tackling all the insect species was a step too far.  Among the finds were 124 species and eight subspecies believed to be new to science, like the spiny rat, whiptail lizard and orchid below.  They documented 13 new species of butterfly. The Corinna Daggerwing was known before.  Of course, the conclusion of the survey raises a question: Why does it matter which park is most diverse?  [Like the Science Times page on Facebook.| Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Bolivia is not headed for a World Cup-style confrontation with other protected areas, like Manu National Park in Peru, which has been considered the most diverse up to now, or Yasuni National Park in Ecuador, which is still ahead of Madidi in amphibians and reptiles like the Bolivian coral snake, which is highly venomous.  Fish, including the completely harmless pupfish below, are still being counted.  In fact, the conservation society provides support to both those parks and many others. But national pride can be a motivator for conservation and Dr. Wallace said that the survey was initiated largely because ""people in Bolivia did not know how special Madidi really was."" The survey made scientific sense because having a baseline record of diversity in any protected area is important for understanding what happens as climate and development around the area change. For researchers interested in how species interact with one another and their environment, the first step is knowing about the species themselves, like the Madidi titi monkey, discovered in the park in 2000 by Dr. Wallace and Humberto Gómez, and deemed a new species in 2004. The river otter is more well-known.  Species counts are never definitive, however. How many people are counting, what areas they choose to sample, time of year, changes in environment over time — all can affect the final totals. Manu National Park, or Yasuni National Park, or another protected area could conduct new counts and totals could change. The point, of course, is to protect as many species as possible, in Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador or anywhere on the planet. But a little national pride in one's own preservation efforts can only help protected animals and plants to flourish. "
1,2018-05-22," SEATTLE — In late 2016, Amazon introduced a new online service that could help identify faces and other objects in images, offering it to anyone at a low cost through its giant cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services. Not long after, it began pitching the technology to law enforcement agencies, saying the program could aid criminal investigations by recognizing suspects in photos and videos. It used a couple of early customers, like the Orlando Police Department in Florida and the Washington County Sheriff's Office in Oregon, to encourage other officials to sign up. But now that aggressive push is putting the giant tech company at the center of an increasingly heated debate around the role of facial recognition in law enforcement. Fans of the technology see a powerful new tool for catching criminals, but detractors see an instrument of mass surveillance. On Tuesday, the American Civil Liberties Union led a group of more than two dozen civil rights organizations that asked Amazon to stop selling its image recognition system, called Rekognition, to law enforcement. The group says that the police could use it to track protesters or others whom authorities deem suspicious, rather than limiting it to people committing crimes. Facial recognition is not new technology, but the organizations appear to be focusing on Amazon because of its prominence and what they see as a departure from the company's oft-stated focus on customers. ""Amazon Rekognition is primed for abuse in the hands of governments,"" the group said in the letter, which was addressed to Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive. ""This product poses a grave threat to communities, including people of color and immigrants, and to the trust and respect Amazon has worked to build."" With the letter, the A.C.L.U. released a collection of internal emails and other documents from law enforcement agencies in Washington County and Orlando that it obtained through open records requests. The correspondence between Amazon and law enforcement officials provides an unusual peek into the company's ambitions with facial recognition tools, and how it has interacted with some of the officials using its products. Many of the companies supplying the technology are security contractors little known to the public, but Amazon is one of the first major tech companies to actively market technology for conducting facial recognition to law enforcement. The efforts are still a tiny part of Amazon's business, with the service one of dozens it offers through Amazon Web Services. But few companies have Amazon's ability to effectively push widespread adoption of tech products. ""The idea that a massive and highly resourced company like Amazon has moved decisively into this space could mark a sea change for this technology,"" said Alvaro Bedoya, executive director at the Center on Privacy & Technology at the Georgetown University Law Center. In a statement, a spokeswoman for Amazon Web Services stressed that the company offered a general image recognition technology that could automate the process of identifying people, objects and activities. She said amusement parks had used it to find lost children, and Sky News, the British broadcaster, used it last weekend to automatically identify guests attending the royal wedding. (The New York Times has also used the technology, including for the royal wedding.) The spokeswoman said that, as with all A.W.S. services, the company requires customers to comply with the law. The United States military and intelligence agencies have used facial recognition tools for years in overseas conflicts to identify possible terrorist suspects. But domestic law enforcement agencies are increasingly using the technology at home for more routine forms of policing. The people who can be identified through facial recognition systems are not just those with criminal records. More than 130 million American adults are in facial recognition databases that can be searched in criminal investigations, the Center on Privacy & Technology at Georgetown Law estimates. Facial recognition is showing up in new corners of public life all the time, often followed by challenges from critics about its efficacy as a security tool and its impact on privacy. Arenas are using it to screen for known troublemakers at events, while the Department of Homeland Security is using it to identify foreign visitors who overstay their visas at airports. And in China, facial recognition is ubiquitous, used to identify customers in stores and single out jaywalkers. There are also concerns about the accuracy of facial recognition, with troubling variations based on gender and race. One study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology showed that the gender of darker-skinned women was misidentified up to 35 percent of the time by facial recognition software. ""We have it being used in unaccountable ways and with no regulation,"" said Malkia Cyril, executive director of the Center for Media Justice, a nonprofit civil rights organization that signed the A.C.L.U.'s letter to Amazon. The documents the A.C.L.U. obtained from the Orlando Police Department show city officials considering using video analysis tools from Amazon with footage from surveillance cameras, body-worn cameras and drones. Amazon may have gone a little far in describing what the technology can do. This month, it published a video of an Amazon official, Ranju Das, speaking at a company event in Seoul, South Korea, in which he said Orlando could even use Amazon's Rekognition system to find the whereabouts of the mayor through cameras around the city. In a statement, a spokesman for the Orlando Police Department, Sgt. Eduardo Bernal, said the city was not using Amazon's technology to track the location of elected officials in its jurisdiction, nor did it have plans to. He said the department was testing Amazon's service now, but was not using it in investigations or public spaces. ""We are always looking for new solutions to further our ability to keep the residents and visitors of Orlando safe,"" he said. (On Thursday, Amazon added a note on the YouTube page for the video of Mr. Das that said he ""got confused and misspoke about the City of Orlando's use of A.W.S. technologies."") Early last year, the company began courting the Washington County Sheriff's Office outside of Portland, Ore., eager to promote how it was using Amazon's service for recognizing faces, emails obtained by the A.C.L.U. show. Chris Adzima, a systems analyst in the office, told Amazon officials that he fed about 300,000 images from the county's mug shot database into Amazon's system. Within a week of going live, the system was used to identify and arrest a suspect who stole more than $5,000 from local stores, he said, adding there were no leads before the system identified him. The technology was also cheap, costing just a few dollars a month after a setup fee of around $400. Mr. Adzima ended up writing a blog post for Amazon about how the sheriff's office was using Rekognition. He spoke at one of the company's technical conferences, and local media began reporting on their efforts. After the attention, other law enforcement agencies in Oregon, Arizona and California began to reach to Washington County to learn more about how it was using Amazon's system, emails show. In February of last year, before the publicity wave, Mr. Adzima told an Amazon representative in an email that the county's lawyer was worried the public might believe ""that we are constantly checking faces from everything, kind of a Big Brother vibe."" ""They are concerned that A.C.L.U. might consider this the government getting in bed with big data,"" Mr. Adzima said in an email. He did not respond to a request for comment for this article. Deputy Jeff Talbot, a spokesman for the Washington County Sheriff's Office, said Amazon's facial recognition system was not being used for mass surveillance by the office. The company has a policy to use the technology only to identify a suspect in a criminal investigation, he said, and has no plans to use it with footage from body cameras or real-time surveillance systems. ""We are aware of those privacy concerns,"" he said. ""That's why we have a policy drafted and why we've tried to educate the public about what we do and don't do."""
0,2018-05-25," They're always listening. They're on the internet. But what happens when digital assistants like Alexa go rogue? Could they share our private conversations without our consent? Privacy advocates have long warned this could happen, and now it has. A woman in Portland, Ore.,  told KIRO7, a television news station in Washington, that her Amazon Echo device had recorded a conversation then shared it with one of her husband's employees in Seattle. Skeptics were quick to say we told you so, as the news rocketed through the connected world. Now, Amazon says it knows what happened: As the woman, identified only as Danielle, chatted away with her husband, the device's virtual assistant, Alexa, mistakenly heard a series of requests and commands to send the recording as a voice message to one of the husband's employees. ""Echo woke up due to a word in background conversation sounding like 'Alexa,'"" Amazon said in a statement. ""Then, the subsequent conversation was heard as a 'send message' request. At which point, Alexa said out loud 'To whom?' At which point, the background conversation was interpreted as a name in the customer's contact list. Alexa then asked out loud, '[contact name], right?' Alexa then interpreted background conversation as 'right'. As unlikely as this string of events is, we are evaluating options to make this case even less likely."" [Earlier: Amazon explains why Alexa was laughing at customers.] In a follow-up interview, though, Danielle told KIRO7 that the Echo that shared her conversation was right next to her at the time with the volume set to seven out of 10. It never requested her permission to send the audio, she said. The family had several Echoes in their home, using them to control the heat, lights and security system. But, two weeks ago, Danielle's husband received a call from the employee in Seattle, who reported receiving audio of their conversation. ""At first, my husband was like, 'No, you didn't,'"" Danielle told KIRO7. ""And he's like, 'You sat there talking about hardwood floors.' And we said, 'Oh gosh, you really did!'"" The family disconnected the devices and contacted Amazon, prompting an investigation. Now, Danielle is asking for a refund. ""I'm never plugging that device in again,"" she told KIRO7. ""I can't trust it."" If you own an Echo and are concerned about what it might be recording, an Amazon help page explains that you can review, listen and delete the audio and other interactions in the settings menu. [How Amazon and Google are working to listen for your heart's desires.] The news was met with a mix of alarm and humor on social media. Amazon's main home assistant devices — the Echo, Echo Plus and Echo Dot — are each equipped with seven microphones and noise-canceling technology. Amazon and Google are the leading sellers of such devices. This is not the first report of an Echo mishearing commands, with unusual results. Amazon offered a similar explanation in March after several users reported hearing Alexa laugh at random times. The assistant, the company said, had ""in rare circumstances"" mistakenly heard ""Alexa, laugh."" As a result, Amazon changed the phrase for that command to ""Alexa, can you laugh?"" and had the device verbally acknowledge such requests. This month, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, said in a published paper that they had proved that the technology could be exploited, too. The researchers said that they were able to hide commands in recordings of music or spoken text that went unnoticed by humans but were understood by personal assistants such as Apple's Siri, Google's Assistant and Amazon's Alexa."
1,2018-05-25," President Trump has declared war on Amazon, the nation's second most valuable company. Amazon is creating more jobs than all but a handful of entire states. And nearly every major city in the country is vying to land the second headquarters of this global retailer and the 50,000 high-paying positions it promises to bring. It is perhaps the biggest job engine in the United States, and the president is using the power of his office to hurt it. And he's doing this while going out of his way to help Chinese jobs, those at the rogue telecom giant ZTE. ""Too many jobs in China lost,"" Trump tweeted. He said that in the midst of a dubious round of deal-making that resulted in a promise from him to help the foreign phone company and coincided with a pledge from China of a $500 million loan to a Trump-linked property. That deal looks very much like a bribe, as my colleague Paul Krugman noted. But let's back up and take a look at the Amazon assaults. For added perspective, just substitute ""Obama"" for ""Trump"" and consider how it would look. Amazon is no saint, certainly, with low wages at some warehouses and a business strategy that has hurt many small retailers while helping others. All the major tech companies could use a clamp of regulation to restrain their intrusions into daily life and commerce. But Mr. Trump isn't the least bit concerned about any of that. Those issues are too complex for him. He sees the world as a brute with power. Everything goes through a love-me, hate-me prism. Sycophants are rewarded. Dissidents are crushed. Diplomacy, as he just showed with his laughable, incoherent dance with North Korea, is much harder. Trump hates Jeff Bezos, the founder and chairman of Amazon. It's possible he hates him for his success; Bezos transformed a mailbox bookseller into the world's largest online retailer. There are far more Amazon Prime members in this country than people who voted for Trump. As a businessman, Trump stumbled through multiple bankruptcies, defrauded students at a phony ""university"" and even ran a casino into the ground. But the more likely reason Trump hates Bezos is that he owns The Washington Post, which has a much different way of covering the president than Fox News, where Trump gets most of his misinformation. The Post is protected by the First Amendment, as is the neighborhood blog, the fact-deficient world of talk radio and random opinions of every citizen. So, instead of going after the newspaper, Trump is going after its owner — who has nothing to do with the news operation, as Martin Baron, the executive editor of The Post has said. Trump reportedly pushed the postmaster general, Megan Brennan, to double the rates that the Postal Service charges Amazon for shipping — even though those rates are bound by contract and are beneficial to the struggling agency. A case can even be made that if it weren't for Amazon, the Postal Service might be out of business. ""He's off the hook on this,"" Vanity Fair quoted one insider as saying. ""It's war."" This is what unrestrained strongmen do: use the state to punish — or silence — their enemies. It's the same thing Trump is doing by demanding that the Justice Department investigate the people who are investigating him. Trump couldn't be more clear on this point. The free press, he says, is the ""enemy of the people."" His aim, he told Lesley Stahl of ""60 Minutes,"" is ""to discredit you all and demean you all so when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you."" A newspaper to Trump's liking is The National Enquirer, whose publisher, David Pecker, is a Trump lackey, doing dirty work to protect the president from the embarrassment of his personal behavior. Autocrats reward friends. In Trump's promising to lift restrictions on ZTE — which was punished for doing business with North Korea and Iran — the United States got completely rolled by China. But in turn, China put money on the table that would help the Trump family business. Country last, Trump first. When Trump was just a no-class developer who used his private fixers to go after his enemies, and lied five ways before breakfast, it was of no consequence to the rest of us. No more. ""If our leaders seek to conceal the truth, or we as people become accepting of alternative realities that are no longer grounded in facts, then we as American citizens are on a path to relinquishing our freedom."" So said former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. It was too little, too late. But better than the complicity-by-silence of Republicans in Congress. Paul Ryan, your spine is calling you. Mitch McConnell, your past words are here for pickup and in need of some defense. Anyone who thought autocracy would arrive with back-room deals or sleight-of-hand machinations at midnight should think again. Trump crosses a new line every week, in plain sight. Democracy dies in sunlight."
2,2018-05-25," Amazon releases a new adaptation of Joan Lindsay's acclaimed 1967 novel. And Gillian Jacobs plays a New Yorker abroad in ""Ibiza."" PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK on Amazon. Natalie Dormer, known for her portrayal of Margaery Tyrell on ""Game of Thrones,"" stars in this latest adaptation of Joan Lindsay's 1967 novel, which also inspired a 1975 film. Ms. Dormer plays the headstrong headmistress of an Australian girls' boarding school who, one fateful Valentine's Day, arranges for a group of pupils to be taken out for a picnic at the real-life geological formation referenced in the title. Then, a mysterious disappearance occurs. The six episodes of this adaptation's first season artfully capture the story in warm, soft tones that lend a dreamlike quality, distorting the line between the real and the imagined. As for whether the tale itself is fact or fiction? In her book, Ms. Lindsay was pointedly dismissive of that question. A passage at the beginning of the novel reads: ""As the fateful picnic took place in the year nineteen hundred, and all the characters who appear in this book are long since dead, it hardly seems important.""

Amazon and Google are the leading sellers of such devices. This is not the first report of an Echo mishearing commands, with unusual results. Amazon offered a similar explanation in March after several users reported hearing Alexa laugh at random times. The assistant, the company said, had ""in rare circumstances"" mistakenly heard ""Alexa, laugh."" As a result, Amazon changed the phrase for that command to ""Alexa, can you laugh?"" and had the device verbally acknowledge such requests. This month, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, said in a published paper that they had proved that the technology could be exploited, too. The researchers said that they were able to hide commands in recordings of music or spoken text that went unnoticed by humans but were understood by personal assistants such as Apple's Siri, Google's Assistant and Amazon's Alexa."
4,2018-05-25," President Trump has declared war on Amazon, the nation's second most valuable company. Amazon is creating more jobs than all but a handful of entire states. And nearly every major city in the country is vying to land the second headquarters of this global retailer and the 50,000 high-paying positions it promises to bring. It is perhaps the biggest job engine in the United States, and the president is using the power of his office to hurt it. And he's doing this while going out of his way to help Chinese jobs, those at the rogue telecom giant ZTE. ""Too many jobs in China lost,"" Trump tweeted. He said that in the midst of a dubious round of deal-making that resulted in a promise from him to help the foreign phone company and coincided with a pledge from China of a $500 million loan to a Trump-linked property. That deal looks very much like a bribe, as my colleague Paul Krugman noted. But let's back up and take a look at the Amazon assaults. For added perspective, just substitute ""Obama"" for ""Trump"" and consider how it would look. Amazon is no saint, certainly, with low wages at some warehouses and a business strategy that has hurt many small retailers while helping others. All the major tech companies could use a clamp of regulation to restrain their intrusions into daily life and commerce. But Mr. Trump isn't the least bit concerned about any of that. Those issues are too complex for him. He sees the world as a brute with power. Everything goes through a love-me, hate-me prism. Sycophants are rewarded. Dissidents are crushed. Diplomacy, as he just showed with his laughable, incoherent dance with North Korea, is much harder. Trump hates Jeff Bezos, the founder and chairman of Amazon. It's possible he hates him for his success; Bezos transformed a mailbox bookseller into the world's largest online retailer. There are far more Amazon Prime members in this country than people who voted for Trump. As a businessman, Trump stumbled through multiple bankruptcies, defrauded students at a phony ""university"" and even ran a casino into the ground. But the more likely reason Trump hates Bezos is that he owns The Washington Post, which has a much different way of covering the president than Fox News, where Trump gets most of his misinformation. The Post is protected by the First Amendment, as is the neighborhood blog, the fact-deficient world of talk radio and random opinions of every citizen. So, instead of going after the newspaper, Trump is going after its owner — who has nothing to do with the news operation, as Martin Baron, the executive editor of The Post has said. Trump reportedly pushed the postmaster general, Megan Brennan, to double the rates that the Postal Service charges Amazon for shipping — even though those rates are bound by contract and are beneficial to the struggling agency. A case can even be made that if it weren't for Amazon, the Postal Service might be out of business. ""He's off the hook on this,"" Vanity Fair quoted one insider as saying. ""It's war."" This is what unrestrained strongmen do: use the state to punish — or silence — their enemies. It's the same thing Trump is doing by demanding that the Justice Department investigate the people who are investigating him. Trump couldn't be more clear on this point. The free press, he says, is the ""enemy of the people."" His aim, he told Lesley Stahl of ""60 Minutes,"" is ""to discredit you all and demean you all so when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you."" A newspaper to Trump's liking is The National Enquirer, whose publisher, David Pecker, is a Trump lackey, doing dirty work to protect the president from the embarrassment of his personal behavior. Autocrats reward friends. In Trump's promising to lift restrictions on ZTE — which was punished for doing business with North Korea and Iran — the United States got completely rolled by China. But in turn, China put money on the table that would help the Trump family business. Country last, Trump first. When Trump was just a no-class developer who used his private fixers to go after his enemies, and lied five ways before breakfast, it was of no consequence to the rest of us. No more. ""If our leaders seek to conceal the truth, or we as people become accepting of alternative realities that are no longer grounded in facts, then we as American citizens are on a path to relinquishing our freedom."" So said former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. It was too little, too late. But better than the complicity-by-silence of Republicans in Congress. Paul Ryan, your spine is calling you. Mitch McConnell, your past words are here for pickup and in need of some defense. Anyone who thought autocracy would arrive with back-room deals or sleight-of-hand machinations at midnight should think again. Trump crosses a new line every week, in plain sight. Democracy dies in sunlight."
5,2018-05-25," Amazon releases a new adaptation of Joan Lindsay's acclaimed 1967 novel. And Gillian Jacobs plays a New Yorker abroad in ""Ibiza."" PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK on Amazon. Natalie Dormer, known for her portrayal of Margaery Tyrell on ""Game of Thrones,"" stars in this latest adaptation of Joan Lindsay's 1967 novel, which also inspired a 1975 film. Ms. Dormer plays the headstrong headmistress of an Australian girls' boarding school who, one fateful Valentine's Day, arranges for a group of pupils to be taken out for a picnic at the real-life geological formation referenced in the title. Then, a mysterious disappearance occurs. The six episodes of this adaptation's first season artfully capture the story in warm, soft tones that lend a dreamlike quality, distorting the line between the real and the imagined. As for whether the tale itself is fact or fiction? In her book, Ms. Lindsay was pointedly dismissive of that question. A passage at the beginning of the novel reads: ""As the fateful picnic took place in the year nineteen hundred, and all the characters who appear in this book are long since dead, it hardly seems important."" IBIZA (2018) on Netflix. In the opening of this romantic comedy, Frank Sinatra sings ""New York, New York"" as the camera lands on Harper (Gillian Jacobs, of ""Love"" and ""Community""), a thirtysomething employee at a New York public relations firm. She's running her hands through her hair, apparently in frustration at her job; the rift between Sinatra's gussied-up glorification of city life and the experience of modern young New Yorkers is strikingly, hilariously apparent. What's further from reality is what happens next: Harper gets called in to speak with her boss, who informs her that she's getting sent on a business trip to Ibiza. Thankfully for us, Harper brings along good company in her friends, played by Vanessa Bayer (""Saturday Night Live"") and Phoebe Robinson (""2 Dope Queens""). THE TOYS THAT MADE US on Netflix. In the first episodes of this documentary series, released last year, the narrator, Donald Ian Black, explored the histories of four famous toy lines — G.I.

0,2018-06-13," ALEXANDRIA, Va. — Karleen Smith used to work at the Macy's in Landmark Mall, putting price tags on summer dresses, housewares and the latest styles of shoes.  On Saturday, Ms. Smith, 57, returned to her former store, not as an employer or a customer, but as a resident.  The former Macy's in this vacant shopping mall outside Washington has been transformed into a homeless shelter.  ""It's weird to be moving into this building. I used to work here,"" she said inside the shelter's common room, which was once the men's department. ""It's called survival.""  As shopping malls struggle to survive in the era of Amazon, communities are looking for new uses for all the retail space. Some empty stores are finding another life as trampoline parks, offices, college classrooms and churches.  At the vacant Macy's in Alexandria, the Carpenter's Shelter, a nonprofit group, moved into its temporary home last weekend, 15 months after the last shopper rang out. The former store now provides 60 beds, hot meals and showers for families and for single men and women who are having trouble finding a place to live in a city with a scarcity of affordable housing. The Macy's logo and signature star are visible above the shelter's entrance, while some of the floors are covered in the store's faded carpet and white tiles. Toilets and sinks were pulled from a former Lord & Taylor and relocated to the shelter.  The shelter takes up only a corner of the original Macy's, which occupied two cavernous floors. A fire door at the back of the shelter leads to the rest of the dim store, where the perfume and jewelry counters are still intact and a giant Estee Lauder advertisement remains illuminated. The Landmark Mall was once at the vanguard of shopping.  Opened in 1965, the mall housed the region's most fashionable department stores, Hecht's, Woodward & Lothrop and Sears & Roebuck. Boys came to buy their first suit at the haberdasher, and teenage girls could get their shoes dyed to match the color of their prom dress. Alexandria's former mayor William D. Euille remembered playing the clarinet in the high school band at the mall's opening ceremony. ""It was the economic engine of the city,"" he said. Landmark tried to adapt over the years. It began as an open-air shopping center and went through an overhaul in the 1980s to enclose the property.  The department stores would change, reflecting the evolving retail landscape. Regional players were replaced by national chains like Lord & Taylor and Macy's. Eventually, the mall succumbed to retail's propensity to chase after newer, flashier spaces. Developers built larger malls with more upscale brands nearby in Pentagon City and Tysons Corner, siphoning customers away from Landmark.  Landmark's original anchor stores either have been bought out, went bankrupt or are clinging to life — like many in the retail business. Last year, 6,985 stores closed in the United States, a record number, according to Coresight Research, a retail analysis and advisory firm. This year, retailers are on a pace to close roughly 10,000 stores. In its final years of operation, the Landmark's tenants included two dollar stores and a tax preparer. Only the Sears is still operating. A lone, blue inflatable figure dances on the store's roof, beckoning shoppers. There had been plans to revamp the mall by returning it to its roots as an open-air shopping destination. But that proposal never got off the ground, after its former owner General Growth Properties filed for bankruptcy in 2009, and the mall was sold.  Landmark's current owner, the Howard Hughes Corporation, plans to tear down the mall and build a mixed-used space that could include offices, retail and other attractions that are still being finalized. It could take many more years to complete the planning, permitting and construction process for such a huge project.  ""It's a great piece of real estate,"" said Mark Bulmash, a senior vice president of development at Howard Hughes. The delay has created an opportunity for the Carpenter's Shelter, which began housing the homeless in the basement of a local Catholic church in 1982. The group needed a temporary space while it constructs a permanent facility in a different part of Alexandria that will include 97 affordable rental housing units and a shelter. The mall was one of a few areas in Alexandria where zoning allowed for a shelter. After being approached by a member of the shelter's board, Howard Hughes agreed to lease a portion of the former Macy's to the shelter rent free through 2019 and advised on the construction.  ""They didn't have to stick their neck out for this, but they did, and we are grateful,"" said Shannon Steene, the shelter's executive director. Saturday was move-in day for the residents. On a humid, hazy morning, residents loaded onto a chartered city bus at the old shelter and headed for the mall.  Keith Ham, 43, who has been living the shelter for about three months, said his family did not believe where he was moving. ""They say, 'Macy's at the mall?'"" ""And I say, 'For real, Macy's at the mall.'"" Jahlil Commander, 16, dribbled a basketball outside the shelter's front entrance and watched a movie crew set off a smoke machine in the parking lot. Some of the mall property is also being leased out to a production company filming a ""Wonder Woman"" sequel.  Jahlil and his two brothers are sharing a windowless room at the shelter after their mother fell behind on rent.  ""We have a predicament,"" their mother, Shannon Commander, said. ""This is where we come to reset and figure things out.""  Ms. Smith, the former Macy's worker, rested on the floor of the common room under a frayed green blanket. Before coming to the shelter, Ms. Smith had been living in a car and showering in a recreation center. ""I was tired,"" she said.  Ms. Smith, who worked at Macy's as a seasonal hire during the holidays 10 years ago, remembers the store fondly.  On a slow day, she would try on makeup at the cosmetics counter and spray herself with samples of perfume. She said she could never afford to buy anything of her own. ""All I could do was admire it."" As Ms. Smith waited to move into her new room, the electricity cut out to a portion of the shelter and the staff set up battery powered camping lanterns to light the way for movers. Volunteers brought crockpots with taco makings for dinner and put together goody bags for the children staying there.  The accommodations are sparse and some residents could not hide their disappointment that the bedrooms do not have windows. But 4-year-old Mikias Aiychew was so excited to see his new room at the shelter that he could hardly sit through their weekend Jehovah's Witness gathering, his mother said. Dressed in a gray suit vest and small brown dress shoes, Mikias played with a plastic castle in the shelter's new family room.

0,2018-06-17," Late on a recent night, more than 600,000 people watched one of the most popular video game players, Tyler Blevins, engage in Fortnite Battle Royale with a celebrity guest: Drake. Mr. Blevins streams his near-daily video game sessions live on Twitch, a website acquired by Amazon in 2014 for $1.1 billion. He makes more than $500,000 a month on the platform, thanks to his 250,000 paid subscribers, and some of his sessions can last 12 hours. Mr. Blevins, who plays under the name Ninja, is popular not only because of his gaming skill, which is considerable, but because of his draw as a host. Drake was deferential to Mr. Blevins as they teamed up before an audience that peaked at roughly 667,000 viewers, a ratings record (since broken) for a nontournament live stream. As the game progressed, the world-famous rapper played a supporting role, collecting supplies for Ninja, seemingly content to lend a hand to a master at work. Like others who make significant money on Twitch, Mr. Blevins is a born talker, and he bantered with the fans as he and Drake played. Drake joined the conversation, too. He told the commenters that he liked pineapple on his pizza and explained that he was a Ninja fan before Twitch, back when Mr. Blevins, 27, first found fame among gamers on YouTube and Instagram. The popularity of the March 14 Drake-Ninja summit illustrated how dominant Amazon remains in the game-streaming world, despite intense competition from a roster of tech giants: Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Twitter. Streamlabs — a San Francisco tech company whose software allows viewers to tip streamers, giving the company insight into an opaque ecosystem — suggests that Amazon's lead may be all but insurmountable. Its data shows that, in the last quarter, the average number of people watching Twitch's streams at any given moment increased to 953,000, up from 788,000. Twitch's archrival, YouTube Gaming, averaged 272,000 concurrent viewers, down from 308,000 in the previous quarter, Streamlabs reported. YouTube pushed back against the data, but declined to provide numbers of its own. ""We have truly gotten bigger every single month in live gaming, and live gaming viewership is up over two times, year over year,"" said Ryan Wyatt, a YouTube vice president in charge of gaming content. (Ali Moiz, the Streamlabs chief executive, stood by his company's report. ""They should publish their data, if they think this is wrong,"" he said of YouTube.) Twitch began in 2011 as an offshoot of Justin.tv, a lifecasting site founded by two Yale graduates, Emmett Shear and Justin Kan. They started the platform after they found that viewers were more interested in watching their lifecasters play video games than eat or sleep. Big tech companies came courting, and Amazon beat out Google. In the four years since the sale, video gaming as a spectator sport has gone mainstream, and Twitch has captured the majority of those who want to watch it live. For the dedicated fans, the live, freewheeling sessions on Twitch have the appeal of a major sporting event crossed with a talk show. The interaction between the host and viewers is one key to the site's success, making for an involved viewing experience that is markedly different from the prerecorded and edited videos of game sessions that have long been popular on YouTube. On Twitch, the player's face, when visible, typically inhabits a small part of the screen, and the world of the video game takes center position. On the right side of the screen, endless comments from the viewers — mostly male, mostly young — appear in a continuous scroll. Until Twitch came along, YouTube, a subsidiary of Google, was the main hub for gamers. But its focus was on recorded, edited gaming sessions, which are markedly different in tone from the long-form streams that have riveted Twitch fans. In an effort to win over the live audience, Google created YouTube Gaming a year after Amazon entered the fray. Craig Riches, who plays under the name PythonGB, has posted his Minecraft videos on YouTube proper since 2010. Despite his affiliation, he said the Amazon-owned site remained well ahead of Google's foray into live game-streaming. ""It's no secret that YouTube Gaming is still playing catch-up to Twitch's platform,"" said Mr. Riches, 23. The hosts on Twitch, some of whom sign up exclusively with the platform in order to gain access to its moneymaking tools, are rewarded for their ability to make a connection with viewers as much as they are for their gaming prowess. Viewers who pay $4.99 a month for a basic subscription — the money is split evenly between the streamers and Twitch — are looking for immediacy and intimacy. While some hosts at YouTube Gaming offer a similar experience, they have struggled to build audiences as large, and as dedicated, as those on Twitch. ""You have this really unique live interaction you don't get with YouTube videos,"" said Meg Kaylee, a streamer and host on GameStop TV who built her career playing various games on Twitch after starting on YouTube. ""It's a completely different experience."" Citing Twitch's fervent audiences and the ""better job"" it does in communicating with talent, Ms. Kaylee, 20, added that she had never really considered signing up with YouTube Gaming. Other Twitch competitors include Mixer, a comparatively small service from Microsoft that hopes to capitalize on the success of the company's Xbox gaming console. Twitter has entered the field by bidding aggressively to broadcast e-sports on Twitter Live, while offering its live-stream platform, Periscope, as a gathering place for gamers. Facebook has also been scrambling to get in on the growing medium, courting individual gamers and adding the ability to tip streamers on Facebook Live as part of its ""gaming creator pilot program."" (Earlier this month, the company also launched a centralized portal for gaming content called Fb.gg.) Facebook Live, Periscope and Mixer all grew quickly in the last quarter, according to Streamlabs, but none have approached the scale of Twitch. The number of those watching game streams on Facebook's platform, for instance, increased to 56,000 from 27,500, according to the firm's estimates. Even with the rise of live streaming, gamers have continued to do big business posting recorded videos on YouTube's main site, which reports 1.8 billion ""logged in"" users a month, across all types of content. That makes it much larger than Twitch, which claims around 100 million monthly viewers. Mr. Wyatt, the YouTube executive, noted the full scope of YouTube's gaming content, which includes the videos posted on the main site and the live streams on YouTube Gaming, in comparing it with the Amazon-owned platform. ""The size and scale and businesses is not comparable from YouTube to Twitch,"" Mr. Wyatt said. ""Everything that I've seen indicates that video-on-demand will be the biggest part of gaming content consumption."" He also pointed out that YouTube Gaming offered a different kind of programming: its live sessions last ""a couple hours at a time"" — a sharp contrast with the typical Twitch marathons. Still, YouTube created YouTube Gaming in direct response to Twitch. During its first few months, in 2015, the platform's hosts complained about the lack of ways to make money and asked for better tools for managing chat streams, which can easily descend into toxicity. ""It took them a really long time to bring out basic features you would have on Twitch,"" said Cole Riness, a professional YouTuber who specializes in family-friendly gaming videos. YouTube has taken steps to address complaints. Most notably, as of April, its subscription systems — for live and recorded content — have been unified. As for support, Mr. Wyatt said, ""I would argue that we certainly have equivalent moderation tools to any other service on the market."" Other challenges have proved more difficult for YouTube Gaming to solve. The site's copyright policing has frustrated some hosts, who have found themselves penalized, or even barred, because music was playing in the background of their sessions. Twitch has a reputation for being less punitive — or perhaps just less aware — where copyright issues are concerned. While YouTube has made millionaires out of the creators of popular videos through its advertising program, Twitch's hosts make money primarily from subscribers and one-off donations or tips. YouTube Gaming has made it possible for viewers to support hosts this way, but paying audiences haven't materialized at the scale they have on Twitch. Now that it seems well on its way to becoming synonymous with long-form live video gaming, Twitch's competitors may be running out of time to take their shot. Brandon Freytag, a former Twitch employee who is chief executive of Loaded, a talent agency that represents Mr. Blevins, said the most credible challenge to Twitch may come not from another tech company but from within. The most popular hosts, he noted, could be enticed to leave it for another platform, or create their own. They could also make demands of Twitch itself. The popularity of its stars is a force Twitch has yet to reckon with. For now, Mr. Freytag said, the calculus for hosts like Mr. Blevins is pretty simple: ""Everyone is on Twitch."""

0,2018-06-20," I'm not saying America's cities are turning into dystopian technocapitalist hellscapes in which corporations operate every essential service and pull every civic string. But let's take a tour of recent news from the metropolises. ■ In Seattle, the City Council decided last week to undo its plan to impose a $275-per-employee tax on local businesses, a measure it had approved unanimously last month as a way to address the city's homelessness and housing-affordability crisis. Why the retreat? Many of the city's businesses balked at the tax, including Amazon — and no one needed to remind Seattleites that Amazon is very publicly looking for a second city to plant its glass balls. So, the Council caved. ■ The mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, announced that he had tapped the Boring Company, Elon Musk's second side-hustle, to build a high-speed transportation tunnel from O'Hare International Airport to the city center. Boring said it would fully pay for the tunnel, using no public funds, but it is also very likely to hold a long-term lease to the project, capturing all revenue from the private system. ■ You've heard of the app-powered electric scooters that descended like locusts on some American cities last spring. The start-ups that run them made a bold bet: Deploy now; worry about legal niceties later. The bet is paying off. Officials in San Francisco, Austin, Tex., and Santa Monica, Calif., have rushed plans for legalization. Bird, the most ambitious of the scooter start-ups, is now raising money at a $2 billion valuation, just weeks after raising money at a $1 billion valuation. ■ Finally, Domino's Pizza announced a plan to pave America's potholes. I wish I were kidding. As part of the program, Domino's — which has been fashioning itself as a tech company now that it's battling food-delivery start-ups for mind share — will imprint its logo into the roadway, because apparently Domino's is the government now, and he who pays the paver gets to choose the toppings. (A Domino's spokeswoman told that me cities could forgo the logo.) O.K., so maybe I am saying that America's cities are turning into dystopian technocapitalist hellscapes. Across the country, cities are straining. Housing costs are exploding, transportation systems are overwhelmed, infrastructure is crumbling, and inequality is on the rise. Yet there's little support from federal or state authorities — ""infrastructure week"" is a punch line in Washington, not a policy. Efforts to raise money for local projects are under siege from conservative activists, while measures to build more housing are halted by liberal ones. Into this void march the techies, who come bearing money, jobs and promises of out-of-this-world innovation. But there's a catch. Corporations are getting wide latitude in determining the future of cities. They are controlling more key services and winning important battles with once-indomitable city governments. Local officials find themselves at the mercy of tech: They can't live without tech money, even if tech interests have a way of eclipsing every other civic priority. How did tech companies become America's most-powerful local power brokers? Techies once despised politics. But many in the industry now see cities as the ideal beachheads for their planned revolutions in transportation, logistics, housing and other areas. So the tech industry learned how to woo and to fight City Halls — and they started winning, all over. Here are some reasons. One reason tech companies can command greater say in local issues is that many other local institutions, from small businesses to local newspapers, have lost much of their influence — thanks, in large part, to the internet. In his new book, ""The Increasingly United States,"" Daniel Hopkins, a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, points out that social networks and digital media created a media ecosystem that is increasingly obsessed with national issues, and a political-finance system that allows donations to flow nationally. As a result, local issues are sidelined. ""When the framers of the Constitution designed the American political system, they assumed that people would care a lot more about local issues that were tangible and concrete than they would care about the distant ways of Washington,"" Mr. Hopkins said. ""Contemporary American politics is exactly the opposite — we are focused on the spectacle far away."" Mr. Hopkins argues that this has turned local politics sclerotic. For instance, in California, where I live, there's a huge political disagreement between people who favor building more housing and those who argue that development is itself the problem (that is, Yimbys versus Nimbys). Yet among politically connected elites here, I noticed more interest in various faraway congressional special elections than the race we just had for San Francisco mayor. The ""key question for voters is always their national loyalties,"" Mr. Hopkins said. There's much less room for voting based on what's happening nearby. What does this have to do with tech companies? While the fall of local media undermined interest in local issues, tech companies began to notice that their platforms gave them direct access to new levers of local influence. And they began to deploy those levers to withering effect. Uber wrote the script. Travis Kalanick, the ride-hailing company's founder and now-ousted chief executive, pushed into dozens of cities without asking permission. In many cities, the pushback was intense — Uber was disrupting local taxi cartels that had spent decades building their own political power base. But what Uber lacked in political support it made up for in local popularity. Through its app, the company had a direct connection to thousands of riders and drivers who were making a living from its service. They became the basis for ""Travis's Law"": When regulators tried to shut Uber down, the company could ""turn its riders into advocates and use grass-roots political pressure to ensure Uber's continued existence,"" as Bradley Tusk, the political operative whom Mr. Kalanick hired to fight local battles, writes in his coming book, ""The Fixer: Saving Startups From Death by Politics."" The plan worked beautifully. In New York in 2015, Mayor Bill de Blasio floated a proposal to cap Uber's growth. The mayor had the support of most of the City Council; Uber's fight looked impossible. But Mr. Tusk mobilized Uber's constituency, framing the issue in stark racial terms — if Uber failed, black and Latino drivers would lose an economic opportunity, and riders would be stuck with taxis that had long discriminated against them. Uber won and, by following its example, so would the rest of the industry. You might argue that this is all to the good: Cities are drowning in red tape, local leaders are naturally averse to change, and tech companies are doing exactly what innovative companies should do. Shouldn't we be celebrating these innovators? But tech power, at the local level, feels increasingly indomitable. With the mere threat of halting growth, Amazon can send shudders through cities across the country. Even Mr. De Blasio, once seen as a critic of tech, now swoons for Amazon; he lit up New York's landmarks in ""Amazon orange"" to woo Jeff Bezos to open the company's second headquarters there. Or, consider the scooters. Some people love our new e-scooter overlords, and others hate them. But whatever your position, the real problem is that they just appeared out of nowhere one day, suddenly seizing the sidewalks, and many citizens felt they had no real agency in the decision. They were here to stay, whatever nonusers felt about them. Which was all by design. The scooter companies were just following Travis's Law. In Santa Monica, Bird's scooters appeared on city streets in September. Lawmakers balked; in December, the city filed a nine-count criminal complaint against Bird. Bird responded with a button in its app to flood local lawmakers with emails of support. The city yielded: Bird signed a $300,000 settlement with Santa Monica, a pittance of its funding haul, and lawmakers authorized its operations. If you love the scooters, you see nothing wrong with this. But there was a time, in America, when the government paid for infrastructure and the public had a say in important local services. With Ubers ruling the roads, Birds ruling the sidewalks, Elon Musk running our subways and Domino's paving our roads, that age is gone."
1,2018-06-20," It's a marquee name for a marquee venture. Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase, the powerful triumvirate that earlier announced its hope to overhaul the health care of its employees and set an example for the nation, said on Wednesday that it had picked one of the country's most famous doctors to lead the new operation. Dr. Atul Gawande, a Harvard surgeon and staff writer for The New Yorker magazine, will become chief executive of the new company, which will be based in Boston, on July 9. He said he was not stepping down from his current medical and other duties to take the job. The choice of Dr. Gawande, a highly respected doctor and writer on health care, was met with surprise because he has little hands-on experience running a large health care organization, unlike some of the boldface names that have been floated as possible candidates. ""He's such a well-known health care luminary and keen observer, but this is a big leap,"" said Dr. Lisa Bielamowicz, a co-founder of Gist Healthcare, a consultancy in Washington. ""He hasn't led a huge team or company."" By moving into health care, the three corporations had signaled a widespread frustration, shared by many American businesses, with the country's convoluted, high-cost medical infrastructure. In forming the new venture, the alliance said it would ""operate as an independent entity that is free from profit-making incentives and constraints."" As desperate as employers are to see significant change, the alliance's three chief executives — Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett, and JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon — have offered little detail as to what they want, and their efforts so far have been received with skepticism. Corporations have long tried to reduce the cost and complexity of medical care, but making changes requires taking on powerful interests like big hospitals and insurance companies that want to preserve the status quo. The three companies represent roughly 1.2 million employees scattered across different markets, giving them little immediate leverage with health plans and hospitals. The selection of Dr. Gawande, who has spoken out loudly and clearly against some of the issues with health care, is the first concrete step taken by the three to fulfill their promise to shake up the system, which Mr. Buffett has described as ""a tapeworm of American economic competitiveness"" because of spiraling costs that continue to eat up more of the country's gross domestic product. ""We said at the outset that the degree of difficulty is high and success is going to require an expert's knowledge, a beginner's mind, and a long-term orientation,"" Mr. Bezos said on Wednesday. ""Atul embodies all three, and we're starting strong as we move forward in this challenging and worthwhile endeavor."" There is little doubt that Dr. Gawande will be able to outline what he has said he believes are the system's failings. ""Tapping Atul Gawande to head the new venture is a very positive sign,"" said Brian Marcotte, the chief executive of the National Business Group on Health, which represents large employers. ""He is a thought leader, thinks outside the box, and is passionate about fixing what ails our health care system."" Dr. Gawande is a professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School and a practicing surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""This work will take time but must be done,"" Dr. Gawande said in a statement. ""The system is broken, and better is possible."" He declined to be interviewed. He is also the executive director for Ariadne Labs, a joint project by Brigham and Women's and Harvard to further the adoption of measures that aim to improve patient safety, like surgical checklists. In a letter to friends and colleagues, Dr. Gawande said his role as chief executive ""will not require me to leave Ariadne Labs, Brigham Health, or Harvard. My plan is to transition from executive director of Ariadne to chairman, while remaining a surgeon on staff at the Brigham and professor at Harvard. I will also continue to write, including for The New Yorker magazine."" His articles, while influential, have not been immune to criticism. His 2009 New Yorker piece, ""The Cost Conundrum,"" which looked at unnecessary care in McAllen, Texas, by comparing spending patterns around the nation, was required reading in the Obama White House. But McAllen was a hot spot of medical fraud, and subsequent studies showed that the places identified as low-cost under Medicare could actually be high cost for those who are privately insured. Dr. Gawande was chosen for the position after leaders at Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan interviewed many professionals, Mr. Buffett said. The companies seemed to struggle publicly to find an executive, with prominent leaders like David T. Feinberg, the chief executive of Geisinger Health System, the innovative group in Pennsylvania, saying they were not taking the job. While Dr. Gawande does not have business experience, he has spent his career focusing on how to improve care for the sickest patients, said Dr. Bob Kocher, a venture capitalist who advised President Obama on health care policy. He pointed to Dr. Gawande's ability to attract other individuals to the venture. ""He understands the health care system as an insider,"" Dr. Kocher said. ""He has been a truth-teller."" But Dr. Kocher said that Dr. Gawande's public health experience in emphasizing preventive care is unlikely to yield the immediate savings companies like these three want. ""He is going to have to come up with a whole new tool kit,"" he said. The challenge he and the rest of the country face is how to overcome the pricing power of big hospital groups that dominate certain markets, and drug companies, Dr. Kocher said. Employers have also been resistant to limiting the choice of hospitals and doctors for their workers. Instead of finding someone who has experience running a health care business, ""they picked a very splashy name,"" said Craig Garthwaite, a professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. The fact that Dr. Gawande is not devoting all of his energies to the venture makes Mr. Garthwaite more skeptical. ""It starts to feel fundamentally unserious if you're not hiring a full-time C.E.O.,"" Mr. Garthwaite said. ""If you're transforming health care, you're reshaping the economy of Germany, effectively,"" he said. ""It's not a part-time gig."""
2,2018-06-20," I'm not saying America's cities are turning into dystopian technocapitalist hellscapes in which corporations operate every essential service and pull every civic string. But let's take a tour of recent news from the metropolises. ■ In Seattle, the City Council decided last week to undo its plan to impose a $275-per-employee tax on local businesses, a measure it had approved unanimously last month as a way to address the city's homelessness and housing-affordability crisis. Why the retreat? Many of the city's businesses balked at the tax, including Amazon — and no one needed to remind Seattleites that Amazon is very publicly looking for a second city to plant its glass balls. So, the Council caved. ■ The mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, announced that he had tapped the Boring Company, Elon Musk's second side-hustle, to build a high-speed transportation tunnel from O'Hare International Airport to the city center. Boring said it would fully pay for the tunnel, using no public funds, but it is also very likely to hold a long-term lease to the project, capturing all revenue from the private system. ■ You've heard of the app-powered electric scooters that descended like locusts on some American cities last spring. The start-ups that run them made a bold bet: Deploy now; worry about legal niceties later. The bet is paying off. Officials in San Francisco, Austin, Tex., and Santa Monica, Calif., have rushed plans for legalization. Bird, the most ambitious of the scooter start-ups, is now raising money at a $2 billion valuation, just weeks after raising money at a $1 billion valuation. ■ Finally, Domino's Pizza announced a plan to pave America's potholes. I wish I were kidding. As part of the program, Domino's — which has been fashioning itself as a tech company now that it's battling food-delivery start-ups for mind share — will imprint its logo into the roadway, because apparently Domino's is the government now, and he who pays the paver gets to choose the toppings. (A Domino's spokeswoman told that me cities could forgo the logo.) O.K., so maybe I am saying that America's cities are turning into dystopian technocapitalist hellscapes.

0,2018-06-25," Amid a growing outcry about privacy concerns by civil liberties groups, officials in Orlando, Fla., said Monday that the city's Police Department was, for now, ending a pilot program to use Amazon Rekognition facial technology. About two years ago, Amazon introduced an online service that could help identify faces and other objects in images. The retail giant was soon pitching that technology to law enforcement agencies, saying the program could aid criminal investigations by recognizing suspects in photos and videos. The Orlando Police Department and the Washington County Sheriff's Office in Oregon were among the first to try the program. The program thrust Amazon into the center of a heated debate around the role of facial recognition in law enforcement. Proponents of the technology see it as a powerful weapon for catching criminals, while critics see it as an instrument of mass surveillance. In recent weeks, various civil rights organizations had pushed Amazon and law enforcement agencies to not use the image recognition system. They expressed concerns that it could be used to track protesters or others whom authorities see as suspicious, rather than being limited to individuals who are committing crimes. In a letter dated Monday that was sent to Orlando's mayor, Buddy Dyer, and City Council, the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida warned that such surveillance systems ""enable the mass location tracking of residents without criminal suspicion"" and asked that the use of such systems be immediately suspended. In a joint statement, the city and the Police Department said the pilot program ended last week when the contract with Amazon expired. The move was earlier reported by the Florida Politics website. Amazon did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Still, Orlando left the door open to continuing the pilot program at a later date. ""The City of Orlando is always looking for new solutions to further our ability to keep our residents and visitors safe,"" the joint statement said. ""Partnering with innovative companies to test new technology — while also ensuring we uphold privacy laws and in no way violate the rights of others — is critical to us as we work to further keep our community safe."" In Washington County, Ore., the technology is fully operational and has been used for about a year and a half, said Jeff Talbot, a deputy officer and the public information officer for the Sheriff's Office. In an email, he said the technology was used to identify criminal suspects against jail booking photos, which are part of the public record. ""The Sheriff's Office has not, and will not, utilize this technology for mass or real-time surveillance,"" Mr. Talbot said. ""That use is prohibited by both Oregon state law and our own policy."""

3,2018-06-28," In the world of health care, PillPack, an online pharmacy, is a pretty small player. Its work force of 1,000 or so people pales in comparison with the 235,000 who work for Walgreens. But when Amazon announced on Thursday that it was buying PillPack, the deal immediately shook the industry. Shares of Walgreens and Rite Aid tumbled more than 9 percent, while CVS Health dropped 6.6 percent. That's because with one move, Amazon answered the question about when — and how — it would grab a piece of the $560 billion prescription drug industry. It was precisely the sort of deal that the health care industry had feared. Amazon has been hinting at its interest in selling drugs, but it faced the problem of securing pharmacy licenses in each state. PillPack will help overcome that hurdle, since the start-up is licensed to ship drugs in 50 states — clearing the way for the e-commerce giant to quickly become a major player in the business. And it will be doing so without much financial stress. Amazon, which has a market value of over $840 billion, is paying about $1 billion for the start-up, according to one person briefed on the deal, who was not authorized to speak about it publicly. Amazon beat out Walmart for the company, the person said. ""PillPack's visionary team has a combination of deep pharmacy experience and a focus on technology,"" Jeff Wilke, Amazon's chief executive of its consumer business, said in a statement. ""We're excited to see what we can do together on behalf of customers over time."" Anxiety over what Amazon might do in health care has unsettled the industry. The company's interest in drugs has been considered a factor in a wave of recently proposed mergers, including CVS's acquisition of Aetna and a union between the health insurer Cigna and Express Scripts, the pharmacy benefit manager. Amazon's entry could make it easier for some of those deals to get approval from regulators, by adding a new competitor. Last fall, perhaps in a move to get ahead of Amazon, CVS announced it would offer next-day delivery of prescription drugs and same-day service in some big cities. The next-day delivery began this month, for a fee of $4.99. [Read more on how Amazon's past actions have led to stock sell-offs for a wide range of companies.] PillPack, which started in 2013, distributes pills in easy-to-use packages designed for consumers with chronic conditions and multiple prescriptions. The company sorts prescriptions by the dose and includes a label with a picture of each pill and directions on how it should be taken. TJ Parker, a pharmacist, and Elliot Cohen, an engineer, founded the start-up after meeting through a health care innovation program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The company's primary pharmacy is in Manchester, N.H., but it also has numerous other pharmacies, including in Miami, Brooklyn and Austin, Tex. While it has licenses to deliver drugs in all 50 states, it does not now ship to Hawaii. It has raised $118 million in funding, with investors including Accel Partners, Atlas Venture, CRV, Founder Collective, Menlo Ventures, Sherpa Ventures and Techstars. It is not necessarily a major player in the pharmacy world, bringing in about $100 million in revenue in 2017, according to the company. But PillPack has long been seen as a potential target for larger businesses looking at online drug sales. Its national reach made it an attractive prospect for Amazon, said Adam J. Fein, chief executive of the Drug Channels Institute, who studies the industry. After early tussles with pharmacy-benefit managers like Express Scripts, PillPack also managed to work with major benefit managers and insurers, not an easy feat for an online pharmacy that directly competes with many of those companies' mail-order businesses. ""It's a turnkey mail pharmacy operation,"" Mr. Fein said. Even as Americans have shifted their buying habits online, prescription drugs have remained a stubbornly brick-and-mortar purchase. About 90 percent of all prescriptions are filled at a pharmacy counter, according to Iqvia, a research firm. If Amazon can break that habit, it could upend the industry. ""It helps people to eliminate that trip and buy everything they need from Amazon,"" said Stephen Buck, a pharmaceutical supply-chain expert who co-founded the drug-price website GoodRx. In a call with investors on Thursday, Stefano Pessina, chief executive officer of Walgreens Boots Alliance, said he was not concerned about Amazon's acquisition. He said the physical pharmacy would remain important to customers in the future. ""We are not complacent, we know we have to change the level of our services to the customers, and we are working in that direction, but we are not worried,"" he said. Carolyn Castel, a spokeswoman at CVS Health, said her company had the same abilities as PillPack, with many more existing customers. ""Keep in mind that we have not seen a large shift of patients that are looking for their medications to be delivered versus coming to a retail pharmacy,"" she wrote in an email. ""And for those patients that do desire to transition, we offer the option."" Independent online pharmacies have had a tough time because consumers who do buy their prescriptions through mail order are often required to do so by their insurance plans. Pharmacy benefit managers have traditionally offered employers and insurers incentives requiring that long-term prescriptions be filled through the managers' own mail-order pharmacies. And for short-term prescriptions, like antibiotics, many consumers prefer their corner drugstore, since they often need to fill those drugs right away. About 85 percent of prescriptions in the United States are for refills, according to Iqvia. But Mr. Buck and others said Amazon might have a new opportunity. A growing number of Americans are without health insurance or have such high deductibles that they may be better off bargain shopping on their own. He estimated that 25 million Americans fell into that category. Until now, he said, PillPack has not aggressively competed on price. With Amazon in charge, ""how about they start posting prices that are really, really aggressive?"" Mr. Buck said. The deal for PillPack could be just one piece in Amazon's broader health ambitions. In January, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase announced plans to form an independent health care company for their employees in the United States, in what could become an incubator for new ideas. Last week, the companies said Dr. Atul Gawande, a Harvard surgeon and staff writer for The New Yorker, would become chief executive of the business. Amazon has also pushed to expand its medical supplies business, seeking to become a major supplier for hospitals and outpatient clinics. It received wholesale pharmacy licenses from several states this year that permit it to start selling medical equipment to businesses. Its products could be used to supply operating and emergency rooms, along with outpatient locations. The company previously tried to enter the pharmaceutical world in 1999 by purchasing 40 percent of Drugstore.com. However, it ran into logistical and regulatory challenges that ultimately derailed the effort. John Sculley, a former chief executive of Apple and the chief marketing officer of RxAdvance, a pharmacy benefit manager, said PillPack was a natural choice for Amazon. ""This one plays right into everything they know how to do,"" he said. ""It's in their wheelhouse."""

1,2018-06-29," Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the week's news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here. Greetings, nerds and Luddites. I'm Brian X. Chen, your personal tech columnist, and I'm here to guide you through the week's tech news. Let me get this off my chest: Does anyone else feel that Amazon is slowly taking over the world? Riding on the success of Amazon Prime, the company is offering incentives for Whole Foods shoppers to sign up for Prime. This week, Prime members started getting an extra 10 percent off items that are marked on sale (with a yellow tag) at all Whole Foods stores across the United States. To redeem the discount at the checkout counter, you open the Whole Foods app on your smartphone and scan a bar code. Amazon seems well aware that people are so unaccustomed to getting discounts at Whole Foods that they will exchange data about their grocery shopping habits for a few cents. The other day, I scanned the bar code at Whole Foods and shaved a dollar off my $56 grocery bill. Maybe in a few months, I'll save up enough to get a free bottle of kale juice. Beyond groceries, Amazon is starting to invade our lives through the world of pharmaceuticals. This week, the company said it had acquired PillPack, an online pharmacy, in a deal that could immediately make it a big player in the drug business. The acquisition helps Amazon overcome the bureaucratic hurdle of securing pharmacy licenses, since PillPack is already licensed to ship prescriptions in 50 states. The purchase is expected to close in the second half of 2018. So pretty soon, when you're restocking your home with diapers, dog food and trash bags on Amazon, you may also be able to refill your drug prescriptions. In other Amazon news this week — yes, there really is more! — the company said it planned to expand its army of delivery workers, announcing a program that helps people start businesses delivering packages for the e-commerce giant. Here's the pitch: If you invest at least $10,000, you can operate a fleet of Amazon-branded vehicles and manage people who wear Amazon uniforms. Amazon estimates an owner could earn as much as $300,000 a year in profit operating a fleet of up to 40 vehicles. It's another effort by Amazon to build out its own delivery logistics. The company already runs Amazon Flex, a program that pays people $18 to $25 an hour to deliver packages from their own cars. So can Amazon do a better job at delivering packages than services like FedEx, United Parcel Service or the United States Postal Service? I guess we'll find out. Other stuff: ■ Apple and Samsung Electronics finally ended their smartphone patent wars. It only took seven years. Law professors said the whole legal battle was pretty pointless. ■ Because we can't get enough Amazon: A writer for The Atlantic, Alana Semuels, documented her experience delivering packages for Amazon Flex in San Francisco. She found that after expenses were accounted for, she earned less than minimum wage. ■ Facebook said it was giving up on producing a fleet of solar-powered drones that would beam internet access to people around the world. The company said it would rely on other companies to build aircraft. ■ Apple's funky-looking wireless earphones, AirPods, may get an upgrade next year. Bloomberg says to expect higher-end AirPods with features like noise cancellation and water resistance. ■ And finally, our tech columnist, Farhad Manjoo, says we have reached ""Peak Screen,"" with Americans spending three to four hours a day looking at their phones and about 11 hours a day looking at screens of any kind. As we look ahead, the question is how can we move toward a less tech-immersed future. Brian X. Chen writes the Tech Fix column, a research-driven feature aimed at solving your everyday tech problems.

0,2018-07-02," LEH, India — Perched high in the Himalayas, near India's border with China, the tiny town of Leh sometimes seems as if it has been left behind by modern technology. Internet and cellphone service is spotty, the two roads to the outside world are snowed in every winter, and Buddhist monasteries compete with military outposts for prime mountaintop locations. But early each morning, the convenience of the digital age arrives, by way of a plane carrying 15 to 20 bags of packages from Amazon. At an elevation of 11,562 feet, Leh is the highest spot in the world where the company offers speedy delivery. When the plane arrives from New Delhi, it is met by employees from Amazon's local delivery partner, Incredible Himalaya, who then shuttle the packages by van to a modest warehouse nearby. Eshay Rangdol, 26, the nephew of the owner, helps oversee the sorting of the packages and delivers many of them himself.  The couriers must follow exacting standards set by Amazon, from wearing closed-toe shoes and being neatly groomed to displaying their ID cards and carrying a fully charged cellphone.  Amazon began offering doorstep delivery in this region last fall, as part of an effort to better serve the remotest corners of India. Sales volume in Leh is up twelvefold since Incredible Himalaya took over deliveries from the postal service, which was much slower and required customers to pick up packages at the post office. Local delivery partners like Incredible Himalaya are vital to the American company's global strategy, especially as it tries to diversify beyond traditional package delivery companies like United Parcel Service or FedEx. Last week, Amazon announced a program to entice more small businesses to join the company's delivery network in the United States. Leh is geographically and culturally close to Tibet, a region controlled by China. Buddhist monasteries tend to the religious needs of the town's 30,000 residents, while military units guard the still-disputed border with China.  Mr. Rangdol and the other couriers get to the shoppers via motorcycle and scooter. When the snow is heavy in the winter, they will occasionally use a car. But two wheels are generally better than four to navigate Leh's narrow, bumpy roads and dodge the ubiquitous cows.  Skalzing Dolma, a frequent Amazon customer, was Mr. Rangdol's first stop on a recent day, receiving a delivery of bedsheets and eye shadow.  Ms. Dolma has bought everything from clothing to kitchen appliances on Amazon and estimated that she has spent a total of 100,000 rupees, or around $1,500, on the site. With few choices in Leh stores, cosmetics and clothing are popular categories for Amazon here. Orders typically arrive in five to seven days, slower than the two-day delivery that Amazon's big-city customers receive but quicker than the monthlong journey they often took with the post office. With a baby due in July, Rigzin Dolker, who used to work at call centers in Delhi, finds Amazon to be far more convenient than trekking into town. She has been buying baby clothes and makeup from the company.  Fortunately for Amazon, the local soldiers and monks are big customers. Thinley Odzer, a monk at the tiny Kartse Monastery, received a backpack. In the past, he has bought mobile phone cases and parts for his motorbike. Leh hardly seems like the kind of market that would appeal to a global e-commerce giant like Amazon. Internet service — essential to placing an order — cuts out frequently during the best of times and goes down entirely for weeks or months during winter, when the trunk line to Srinagar, the state capital, is damaged under the snow.  But Amazon takes the long view. E-commerce is spreading globally, and India is a prime battleground, where customers are just beginning to shop online and loyalties are not yet established. Walmart recently announced plans to buy a controlling interest in India's leading e-commerce company, Flipkart, allowing it to challenge Amazon directly for the wallets of Indian consumers. Amazon may never make money shipping products by air to customers in Leh. But the idea is that profits from dense urban areas like Mumbai and Delhi will subsidize service to more remote ones. ""We want to make delivery convenient to where our customers are,"" said Tim Collins, Amazon's vice president of global logistics. ""Over time, the economics will work themselves out."" The strategy rankles Leh merchants like Nawang Shispa, owner of Tsering Electronics, who said his sales of phones and accessories had dropped 10 percent since Amazon started quicker delivery to the community.  Still, his salesmen compensate. One of them sold a new Oppo smartphone to Jigmat Amo, 16, by slightly undercutting Amazon's price. Ms. Amo said she was a bit leery of Amazon after buying a handbag and a pair of ballet shoes from the site that did not look like the pictures. Liyaqat Ali, owner of the Singay General Store in the main town square, figured that there is room enough for both him and Amazon. He does a brisk business selling groceries and sundries like diapers, which people typically need right away.  ""Amazon is new to Leh, and the internet is not so good,"" he said. ""And if you order something like diapers, you have to wait a week to 10 days."" Mr. Rangdol said that in addition to delivering packages and managing the delivery warehouse, he taught people how to order on Amazon.  ""Before I joined Amazon, my friends called me Eshay,"" he said. ""Now they call me Amazon.""  Working with the company is certainly better than his previous job leading tourists on long treks up cold mountains — although he still has to do a bit of climbing with a heavy pack. "
1,2018-07-02," When Amazon announced last week that it was buying the online pharmacy PillPack, it sent stocks of drugstore companies like Walgreens and Rite Aid tumbling, as investors worried that the retail behemoth would soon upend the pharmacy market.  But even though Amazon has transformed the way Americans buy products as different as books and diapers, it may not have such an easy time with prescription drugs. That's because to succeed, it will have to do business with powerful entrenched companies who are not necessarily wishing Amazon well.  As a relatively small pharmacy with about $100 million in annual revenues, PillPack most likely didn't attract much attention from the pharmacy industry's giants, said Eric Percher, an equity research analyst at Nephron Research.  ""I think they have absolutely been able to fly under the radar,"" he said. But now that a household name like Amazon is buying the company, ""the entities that have enabled PillPack's success — whether they knew it or not — have a decision to make,"" he said. PillPack, which was founded in 2013, distributes pills in easy-to-use packages designed for consumers with chronic conditions and multiple prescriptions. The company sorts prescriptions by the dose and includes a label with a picture of each pill and directions on how it should be taken.  While the company had a niche appeal, many analysts have speculated that Amazon's true motivation for buying PillPack is to leapfrog its way into the broader prescription drug business because PillPack has pharmacy licenses in 50 states. It also has relationships with the major pharmacy benefit managers, like Express Scripts and CVS Health, that serve as gatekeepers to the majority of Americans who are covered by health insurance. ""If you want to be a major factor in prescription drugs, you're going to have to have some relationship with a P.B.M.,"" said John Sculley, a former chief executive of Apple, who is now the chief marketing officer of RxAdvance, a pharmacy benefit manager. Benefit managers have come under criticism for unfairly excluding pharmacies from their networks. In 2016, PillPack publicly tussled with Express Scripts after the benefit manager excluded the start-up from its mail-order network, saying that PillPack had misrepresented itself as a brick-and-mortar company. Although that dispute was resolved, Express Scripts said on Friday that its network agreement with PillPack was expiring in July and that the two companies had not reached an agreement on rates. It also said that it was investigating PillPack for ""provider compliance,"" although it did not elaborate. CVS Health said PillPack is in ""many"" of its pharmacy networks, including for commercially insured consumers as well as Medicare beneficiaries.  OptumRx, another large benefit manager, did not comment, although a spokeswoman for PillPack said the company was in OptumRx's commercial pharmacy network. She declined to comment on the negotiations over the Express Scripts contract. Mr. Percher said other industry players may also have an interest in muting Amazon's success. PillPack gets its drugs from AmerisourceBergen, a major distributor. Walgreens owns 26 percent of AmerisourceBergen and this year was reported to be in talks to buy the company, a tie that Mr. Percher said could pose a conflict if Amazon sought to directly compete with Walgreens. Ana Gupte, a senior health care analyst for Leerink Partners, said some of these companies could opt to partner with Amazon instead. ""They have to decide whether Amazon is a valid threat, or an opportunity,"" Ms. Gupte said. If Express Scripts finds a way to exclude them from its pool of customers, ""Amazon will find other ways to get into the market, and they will become a competitor,"" she said. Indeed, several industry executives, including Tim Wentworth, the chief executive of Express Scripts, have expressed interest in working with Amazon. Express Scripts announced in March that it was being acquired by the insurer Cigna, one of many health care mergers that were seen to have been motivated, at least in part, by hints of Amazon's potential entry into the market. But Nadina J. Rosier, the health and group benefits pharmacy practice leader at the consulting firm Willis Towers Watson, said she was skeptical that Amazon would link up with an established company. ""It's looking to partner with other innovators, not just your standard vendors like your traditional P.B.M.s,"" she said. Any partner ""would have to be one that brings something to the table in an innovative way."" The months of speculation have allowed competitors to prepare, acting as ""a catalyst for participants to close ranks against competition and invest to improve the consumer experience,"" Mr. Percher wrote in a research note last week.  Last fall, CVS announced it would offer next-day delivery of prescription drugs and same-day service in some big cities. The next-day delivery began in June, for a fee of $4.99. In a statement, Express Scripts touted the breadth of its services, saying it delivered more than 100 million prescriptions to patients around the country in 2017. ""Our scale and quality of care provides patients with access to a broader suite of products than other smaller pharmacies,"" the company said. Nevertheless, customers have long complained that the mail-order pharmacies run by companies like Express Scripts and CVS are cumbersome and confusing — perhaps one reason, even in an era of online shopping, that 90 percent of prescriptions are filled at a retail pharmacy counter, according to the data research firm IQVIA. Peter Blicher, 70, of Vacaville, Calif., said he has used several different mail-order pharmacies over the years. ""It's very difficult to do business with them, takes multiple interaction, the customer service is very poor,"" he said. If Amazon were to begin selling prescription drugs, he said, he would sign up. ""I haven't found another e-commerce website that can compare,"" he said."

0,2018-07-03," CAMBRIDGE, England — When you step off the train here and walk into the city square outside the railway station, you will not see the spires of King's College Chapel or the turrets atop the Trinity Great Court. The University of Cambridge is still a cab ride away. But you will see a stone and glass office building with a rooftop patio. This is where Amazon designs its flying drones. Just down the block, inside a stone building of its own, Microsoft is designing some sort of computer chip for artificial intelligence. And if you keep walking, you will soon reach a third building, marked with a powder-blue Apple logo, where engineers are pushing the boundaries of Siri, the talking digital assistant included with every iPhone. For years, journalists, city planners and other government officials have called this ""Silicon Fen,"" envisioning the once sleepy outskirts of Cambridge as Britain's answer to Silicon Valley. The name — a nod to the coastal plain, or Fenlands, that surrounds Cambridge — never quite stuck. But the concept certainly did, so much so that the world's tech powers have moved in, snapping up engineers and researchers, particularly in the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence. Their arrival provides a welcome fillip for the British economy that's expected to be bruised by its departure from the European Union. Apple, Amazon and Google established research and engineering hubs in Britain by acquiring companies that emerged from local universities, spending millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars. There are more than 4,500 high-tech firms in Cambridge, employing nearly 75,000 people, many of them commuters from other communities, according to Cambridge Network, a city business group. Just across the street from Amazon's Cambridge headquarters, ARM, the computer chip company owned by SoftBank, the Japanese tech giant, recently moved a team of engineers into a row of temporary offices. And a new building is going up just yards away. This is where Samsung, the South Korean tech conglomerate, will soon open another artificial intelligence lab, hiring as many as 150 researchers, engineers and other staff. ""For anybody who hasn't been here for 20 years, they may say: 'Is this the same place?'"" said Claire Ruskin, the chief executive of Cambridge Network, as she drove through the city on a recent afternoon. But those buildings outside the train station are reminders that Britain — like Europe as a whole — does not have its own internet powerhouse, a corporate power capable of pushing the world in new technical, cultural and political directions. The closest match was ARM, and that was acquired by SoftBank in 2016. In London, a 45-minute train ride from Cambridge, you will find DeepMind, perhaps the world's leading A.I. lab. DeepMind is at the forefront of a technological revolution that many believe will shift economic and societal norms across the globe, and it was acquired by Google in 2014. ""We welcome the big existing companies,"" said Matthew Hancock, the British secretary of state who oversees digital policy. ""But we're incredibly determined to ensure that the next generation of companies are built here."" On a recent Friday morning, Chris Bishop, who oversees Microsoft Research Cambridge, looked out his fifth-floor office window, with its panoramic view of Cambridge, and pointed to the spires of King's College Chapel rising over the trees in the distance. ""Alan Turing was at King's,"" he said. In 1950, with his essay ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence,"" Turing, the British mathematician, codebreaker and computing pioneer, asked whether machines would ever think on their own. Mr. Bishop, an A.I. researcher who studied at Oxford and took a professorship at the University of Edinburgh before moving to Cambridge, views his work as another link in a long British legacy. Mr. Bishop joined the lab in 1997, just after it was founded. In those days, Microsoft was the one tech giant paying big money to lure top academics into this kind of corporate research. Now, as artificial intelligence takes center stage at leading tech companies, paying big dollars for academics is common. Five years ago, Microsoft moved its lab to the city-block-size building near the rail station. Many of Mr. Bishop's former students and colleagues now work at other big tech companies. Neil Lawrence, a University of Sheffield professor who studied with Mr. Bishop at Cambridge, now works at the new Amazon Cambridge Development Center just down the street. Two prominent A.I. researchers who worked under Mr. Bishop at Microsoft have since moved to Google and DeepMind. Many of these researchers, like a number of other top A.I. researchers in Britain, were born outside the country. Still, local policymakers are concerned about local talent moving into foreign companies. ""We have some of the top A.I. researchers in the world in the U.K.,"" said Dame Wendy Hall, a computer science professor at the University of Southampton. ""How do we stop the A.I. brain drain to the U.S. — or to the U.S. companies anyway?"" Last year, the British government commissioned a report on the country's A.I. landscape from Dame Hall and Jerome Pesenti, the chief executive of BenevolentAI, an artificial intelligence start-up based in London. Within weeks of the report's release, Mr. Pesenti moved to Facebook. He is now vice president of artificial intelligence in the company's New York office. ""It does illustrate the point,"" Dame Hall said. ""Once your head is above the parapet in this world, you draw interest, particularly from the big Silicon Valley giants."" The report called for increased financing for universities, and in the months following the government responded, saying it would fund 200 new Ph.D.s in artificial intelligence and related fields by 2020 and invest a total of $500 million in math, digital and technical education across Britain. In Cambridge, there are bigger questions about the boundaries between academia and industry. Even those who have prospered financially from the dynamic aren't sure where to draw the line. Zoubin Ghahramani, a Cambridge professor who sold a start-up to Uber and is now the company's chief scientist while still maintaining his ties with the university, worries about a brain drain from Europe in artificial intelligence. He has called for the creation of a European research institute to recruit people in the region who may otherwise go work for a Silicon Valley firm. His colleague at Cambridge Steve Young, a respected speech-recognition researcher who has sold companies to Microsoft, Google and Apple, noted that it was ""almost impossible"" for the university to compete for staff against tech companies, limiting who will teach the next generation of students. ""That could have some very severe consequences,"" he said. His comment came with a laugh. Mr. Young splits time between the university and Apple, where an important part of his job is recruitment for the company. ""I don't recruit from Cambridge,"" he joked. Vishal Chatrath was the first employee and the chief business officer at VocalIQ, a Cambridge speech technology start-up that Apple acquired in late 2015 and transformed into a local Siri development center. Now, just two blocks from Apple's Cambridge outpost, he oversees a new start-up called Prowler, which aims to automate business decisions that are typically made by humans. For Mr. Chatrath, Prowler shows how acquisitions by foreign companies can spur the creation of new start-ups. A second VocalIQ employee left and recently founded a start-up called PolyAI, which is trying to build truly conversational computing systems. ""A lot of capital is now flowing in Cambridge, and that capital helps push the next wave of entrepreneurs,"" Mr. Chatrath said. For others, the question is whether start-ups like this will evolve into vibrant companies — or just disappear into a company like Apple or Google. The big American companies are also attracted by the salaries they can pay here. According to the recruitment website Hired, the average tech salary in London is $78,000 a year, versus $142,000 in Silicon Valley. ""It remains one of the huge competitive advantages that you can get the same, or better, talent for cheaper and less churn,"" said Matt Clifford, a co-founder of Entrepreneur First, a start-up incubator in London that recruits students from Cambridge and Oxford. Entrepreneur First helped create Magic Pony, yet another A.I. company, which Twitter acquired for $150 million in 2016. But some wonder whether these companies could better serve Britain by staying independent. Ian Hogarth trained as a machine learning researcher at Cambridge, founded the live music app Songkick and is now an angel investor in Britain. He argued that if DeepMind had remained an independent, it may have grown into the country's first tech superpower. Following a similar path were start-ups like VocalIQ (acquired by Apple) and Evi, the company that Amazon acquired in 2013 as part of its effort to build the Alexa digital assistant. Evi was the foundation for Amazon's Cambridge operation. Many have applauded the enormous economic change these acquisitions are helping to drive in London and Cambridge. But not everyone is clapping. Last year, in Cambridge, a new housing development was vandalized with graffiti written in Latin: ""Locus in Domos Loci Populum."" As the BBC reported, this translates to ""local homes for local people."" As the tech workers land the big salaries, home prices are skyrocketing, and the locals are being squeezed out. It is yet another example of Silicon Fen's looking a lot like Silicon Valley."

0,2018-07-09," Amazon has added an extra six hours to Prime Day, the company's summer version of Cyber Monday. This year, Prime Day starts on July 16 at 3 p.m. Eastern Time and ends on July 17 at midnight. Amazon says it will offer more than a million deals.  But most deals won't be worth your money, and the ones that are will most likely be hard to catch — Lightning Deals (which last until a limited quantity of a product runs out) versus all-day deals, for example. Even so, there are a few items worth tracking throughout the sale. Amazon Prime subscribers, who pay either $12.99 per month or $119 for an annual membership for perks like free two-day shipping and video streaming services, are the lucky few who get access to the offers and special deals. One way to make the most of Prime Day is to enroll in a free trial for the week. (You can always end your enrollment after 30 days.) We recommend also keeping an eye on Amazon's major competitors, like Best Buy, eBay, Target, Sears and Walmart, who may offer competitive pricing through Tuesday. Throughout Monday and Tuesday, Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products, is helping you highlight the best deals through its website, newsletter and on its @WirecutterDeals Twitter account. As it updates its Prime Day Deals Page, we've also highlighted a few of our favorite products on which to keep a watchful eye: Follow Wirecutter for complete and updating coverage of Prime Day."
1,2018-07-09," For many, ""The Cosby Show"" has become unwatchable since the dozens of sexual assault allegations against Bill Cosby entered the media spotlight. Some networks, such as TV Land, have pulled the show from their lineups. (Others, like Bounce TV, initially did the same, only to resume airing reruns up until the verdict came in this year. It remains available to stream on Amazon Prime Video.) But ""A Different World,"" the popular ""Cosby"" spinoff that ended its original run 25 years ago this week, doesn't seem to have inspired the same amount of hand-wringing as its predecessor. Among the many pieces that have been written about Mr. Cosby's legacy and how we square it with the man himself, few pay much attention to ""A Different World,"" which he created. And articles about the sitcom — including a spate of them last fall around another milestone, the 30th anniversary of its September 1987 premiere — tend to mostly leave Mr. Cosby's transgressions out of it. When the ""black-ish"" creator Kenya Barris added ""grown-ish"" earlier this year, he openly cited ""A Different World"" as an influence and expressed hope that his own show could have a similar cultural impact. Some of the reasons for this continued affection are obvious. While Mr. Cosby's name appears in the credits for each episode, he only appeared on screen in three of them, all in Season 1. And after that season, which centered on Denise Huxtable's (Lisa Bonet) transition to university life at the fictional Hillman College, the series was completely revamped. The result of — and possibly a motivation for — this separating of art from artist allows the show to be a repository for the tender sentiments that have been displaced by the retroactive tarnishing of ""The Cosby Show."" As someone who grew up watching and enjoying both shows (though I was too young to remember their original runs), I can relate to this. I haven't wanted to revisit the Huxtable family since Hannibal Buress's scathing onstage condemnation of Mr. Cosby in 2014 that encouraged more women to come forward and accuse Mr. Cosby of sexual assault. But I did binge all six seasons of ""A Different World"" a couple of summers ago when it finally landed on Netflix. (It's now on Amazon.) While I'd rather not again see the Huxtables lip sync to Ray Charles's ""Night Time Is the Right Time"" or Claire cut down her children's dumb retorts with aplomb, I can at least give myself Whitley, Dwayne, Freddie and Kim. It helps that ""A Different World"" was a more challenging, and arguably more meaningful show. When Debbie Allen took over as producer and director in Season 2, she famously made it her mission to set it apart from its more benign predecessor by having the writers tackle more substantive issues, including colorism within the black community, AIDS and shopping while black. Last year, Brittany Brathwaite wrote for The Root about how the show was ahead of its time. In a recent phone conversation, she told me that because of the creative risks it took, she has ""seriously severed Bill Cosby from 'A Different World.'"" ""Do we have to cut off the contributions that the show itself made,"" she continued, ""and all the people that helped contribute to what that was? It's a tension that feels gross, but at the same time feels necessary."" Khris Khal Davenport, who has also written appreciatively of ""A Different World,"" told me that he finds it easier to consume than ""The Cosby Show."" The sensitive topics it tackled in its later seasons ""makes that a more important show,"" he told me. At least one cast member has echoed those sentiments. A few weeks after Mr. Cosby's conviction on three counts of sexual assault, Kadeem Hardison, who portrayed Dwayne Wayne, a nerdy Hillman College student (and later, professor), told TMZ that ""A Different World"" is ""much bigger than Bill Cosby."" I agree. But such compartmentalization isn't always easy — even if the man himself is not the face of the show, its origins as a spinoff will always linger in plain sight. This becomes particularly noticeable when one considers how some of the subjects ""A Different World"" addressed, such as sexual assault, have dark resonance in its creator's private life. ""There was something ugly happening behind the scenes,"" Ezinne Ukoha, who hasn't been able to enjoy ""A Different World"" in the same way others have, told me recently, in reference to the accusations against Mr. Cosby that stretch back decades. ""But it was presented as something that was clean fun."" In May, Ms. Ukoha wrote a piece in Medium: ""Why My Childhood Dies With Bill Cosby's Legacy."" Perhaps the comfort of nostalgia cannot and should not ever be completely divorced from the realities of its roots, but the way some of us cope is by transferring all those warm memories onto one work and discarding the ugliest bits of the rest. It's a selfish compromise, to be sure, one that the women who have come forward with allegations against Mr. Cosby most likely can't even consider. But it is impossible to totally erase a history as influential as Mr. Cosby's, and as consumers we can choose how we engage with it ourselves. For me, at least, the choice is holding on tight to the one part that turned out to be the most progressive and ahead of its time — the part that least resembles its devious creator."

0,2018-07-15," SAN FRANCISCO — Many booksellers on Amazon strive to sell their wares as cheaply as possible. That, after all, is usually how you make a sale in a competitive marketplace. Other merchants favor a counterintuitive approach: Mark the price up to the moon. ""Zowie,"" the romance author Deborah Macgillivray wrote on Twitter last month after she discovered copies of her 2009 novel, ""One Snowy Knight,"" being offered for four figures. One was going for ""$2,630.52 & FREE Shipping,"" she noted. Since other copies of the paperback were being sold elsewhere on Amazon for as little as 99 cents, she was perplexed. ""How many really sell at that price? Are they just hoping to snooker some poor soul?"" Ms. Macgillivray wrote in an email. She noted that her blog had gotten an explosion in traffic from Russia. ""Maybe Russian hackers do this in their spare time, making money on the side,"" she said. Amazon is by far the largest marketplace for both new and used books the world has ever seen, and is also one of the most inscrutable. The retailer directly sells some books, while others are sold by third parties. The wild pricing happens with the latter. Books were Amazon's first product. They made the company's reputation and powered Jeff Bezos' ascent to his perch as the world's richest person. Amazon sold books so cheaply that land-based shops could not compete. It controls about half the market for new books, more than any bookseller in the history of the United States. But books are now a minuscule part of the company's revenue. Amazon is expanding into seemingly every field and  geography, rattling competitors along the way. Prime Day, to be held on Monday, is a promotion that draws enormous media attention to discounted tech, gaming and other products. Meanwhile, the original bookstore is looking a little neglected, as if it were operated by algorithms with little sensible human input. ""Amazon is driving us insane with its willingness to allow third-party vendors to sell authors' books with zero oversight,"" said Vida Engstrand, director of communications for Kensington, which published ""One Snowy Knight."" ""It's maddening and just plain wrong."" The wild book prices were in the remote corners of the Amazon bookstore that the retailer does not pay much attention to, said Guru Hariharan, chief executive of Boomerang Commerce, which develops artificial intelligence technology for retailers and brands. Third-party sellers, he said, come in all shapes and sizes — from well-respected national brands that are trying to maintain some independence from Amazon to entrepreneurial individuals who use Amazon's marketplace as an arbitrage opportunity. These sellers list products they have access to, adjusting price and inventory to drive profits. Then there are the wild pricing specialists, who sell both new and secondhand copies. ""By making these books appear scarce, they are trying to justify the exorbitant price that they have set,"" said Mr. Hariharan, who led a team responsible for 15,000 online sellers when he worked at Amazon a decade ago. Amazon said in a statement that ""we actively monitor and remove"" offers that violate its policies and that examples shown it by The Times — including the hardcover version of the scholarly study ""William T. Vollmann: A Critical Companion,"" which was featured for $3,204, more than 32 times the going price — were ""in error, and have since been removed."" It declined to detail what its policies were. A decade ago, Elisabeth Petry wrote a tribute to her mother, the renowned novelist Ann Petry. ""At Home Inside,"" published by the University of Mississippi Press, is now out of print, but late last week secondhand copies were for sale on Amazon. A discarded library copy was $1,900. One seller offered two copies, each for $1,967, although only one was described as ""Nice!"" All these were a bargain compared with the copy that cost $2,464. ""I wish I had some of that money,"" Ms. Petry said. Buying books on Amazon can be confusing, because sometimes the exact same book can have more than one listing. For instance, a search for the Petry book turned up another listing. This time, there was just one copy for sale, which cost a mere $691. Whether a customer paid that price or three times that sum apparently depended on what listing he or she found. ""Let's be honest,"" said Peter Andrews, a former Amazon brand specialist who is manager of international client services at One Click Retail, a consulting firm. ""If I'm selling a $10 book for $610, all I need to do is get one person to buy it and I've made $600. It's just a matter of setting prices and wishful thinking."" One of the sellers of Ms. Macgillivray's book is named Red Rhino, which says it is based in North Carolina. The bookseller's storefront on Amazon is curiously consistent. One of the first books on the store's first page was Anthony Bourdain's ""Kitchen Confidential."" It was priced at $607, a hundred times what it cost elsewhere on Amazon. All the books on the first few pages of the storefront — including such popular standbys as ""Fahrenheit 451,"" ""The Very Hungry Caterpillar"" and ""1984"" — also go for $600. That appears to be a popular price point for booksellers taking the high road. Acme Books, which was selling the $691 Petry book, used that exact price for ""101 Blessings for the Best Mom in the World"" and quite a few other books. Red Rhino got nearly 1,400 customer-service reviews over the last year — an impressive number, considering many customers do not bother posting reviews. The reviews are 91 percent positive, although some of the reviewers appeared uncertain just what a book is. ""The book is intact, and it is not broken,"" wrote one. Commented another: ""Very nice. Flexibility noted in many venues."" Neither Acme nor Red Rhino returned emails for comment sent through their Amazon pages. As with many Amazon booksellers, it is hard to determine what, if any, existence they have outside the retailer. Even a casual browse through the virtual corridors of Amazon reveals an increasingly bizarre bazaar where the quaint policies of physical bookstores — the stuff no one wants is piled on a cart outside for a buck a volume — are upended. John Sladek, who wrote perceptive science fiction about robotics and artificial intelligence, predicted in a 1975 story that computers might start making compelling but false connections: Mr. Sladek, who died in 2000, is little read now, which naturally means his books are often marketed for inordinate sums on Amazon. One of his mystery novels, ""Invisible Green,"" has a Red Rhino ""buy box"" — Amazon's preferred deal — offering it for $664. That is a real bargain compared with what a bookseller with the improbable name Supersonic Truck is asking: $1,942. (Copies from other booksellers are as little as $30.) Supersonic Truck, which Amazon says has 100 percent positive ratings, did not respond to a message seeking comment. Ms. Macgillivray, who has published eight novels, said she had been poking around Amazon's bookstore and was more perplexed than ever by the pricing. ""There's nothing illegal about someone listing an item for sale at whatever the market will bear, even if they don't have the book but plan to buy it when someone orders it,"" she said. ""At the same time, I would think Amazon wouldn't want their platform used for less than honorable practices."" Since Ms. Macgillivray tweeted about ""One Snowy Knight,"" the price on Amazon has not stood still. The most expensive copy just jumped again, to $2,800."

0,2018-07-19," Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ The race to $1 trillion market value has gotten a lot closer. Amazon's stock hit a high of $1,858.88 on Wednesday after the e-commerce giant announced more than 100 million products were purchased during its Prime Day sale event. The brief rise pushed Amazon's stock market value to $902 billion — the first time that it has exceeded $900 billion. Amazon's market value finished Wednesday at $894 billion, nearly $42 billion below Apple's market capitalization of $936 billion. That marked the narrowest gap between the market values of the two companies since 2006. Investors, traders and Wall Street analysts have speculated for years about which company would be first to surpass $1 trillion in market value. Apple has been the favorite since it became the largest publicly traded company in the United States in 2011. Google has also garnered a few mentions. Earlier this year, its market capitalization crossed $800 billion for the first time and was just $34 billion shy of Apple's. But Amazon has now passed Google on the list of largest publicly traded companies in the United States. Amazon's move above $900 billion highlights the run-up in its shares over the past nine months. On Oct. 26, 2017, its market capitalization stood at $467 billion, meaning its value has nearly doubled over that period. To put that in perspective, Amazon's gain in market capitalization is larger than the value of JPMorgan Chase, Exxon Mobil, or Walmart. In fact, Amazon's increase would rank it the seventh largest company in the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index. By comparison, Apple has stagnated over that period. The company's market capitalization first nudged past $900 billion at the start of November 2017, but since then, it has risen just 3.4 percent through Wednesday's close. Amazon's time in the $900 billion club has been brief so far. Its stock slipped Wednesday and is down slightly again Thursday, pushing its market value to $876 billion. Apple gained 1 percent in early trading Thursday, pushing its market value to $950 billion. That puts Apple more comfortably in the lead. Still, any disappointments or surprises from either could yet unsettle the race."

0,2018-08-01," You may have heard that the tech giants are on their heels. Over the last two years, lawmakers and the public around the globe have been awakened to fears about the expanding powers of the largest technology companies, particularly the ones I've called the Frightful Five: Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft, the most valuable companies on the American markets. The concerns span the gamut. There are calls for renewed antitrust investigations. Some people have accused the companies of political biases, while others have criticized their lack of diversity and how narrowly they distribute their wealth. Then there are the questions of their vulnerability to foreign influence and their capacity for addicting us to their products. In different ways, the companies have conceded some of these fears and have vowed to address them. Taking stock, cleaning up, admitting ""moral responsibility"" for their contributions to society — these are the buzzwords of a tech ecosystem that is supposedly subsumed by remorse and committed to rehabilitation. Yet there is something deeply incongruous at the heart of the supposed ""techlash"": It is not really making a huge dent in the tech giants' financial performance. Over the last two weeks, each of the five reported earnings that were brimming with mostly fantastic news for its investors. Amazon, which has long conditioned shareholders to expect a lot of growth but not much earnings, reported a record profit. Microsoft and Google's parent company, Alphabet, both handily beat Wall Street's projections. On Tuesday, so did Apple; if its price jumps as a result, it could become the first company to reach a market valuation of more than $1 trillion. Wait, but what about Facebook, which told investors to expect lower growth rates and higher expenses, causing its stock to lose $120 billion in market value in a single day? In a strange way, the social network's troubles only underscored its dominance. Even after its stock crash, Facebook remains the fifth most valuable corporation in the American markets, ahead of Berkshire Hathaway, and there are almost no serious calls for its chief executive to resign, as you might expect for any other company experiencing such a loss. That's because the company reported little to cause experts to alter their long-term outlook. Pretty much everyone who studies Facebook believes that it will hold its grip on the culture and the advertising industry for the foreseeable future. ""This is one of the most profitable business models I've ever seen, and that really hasn't changed,"" said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at the firm RBC Capital. He added that Facebook's stock now ""may be the single most attractively priced asset across technology."" Together the earning statements tell a clear story. Despite the public outcry, the five are all expanding their foothold in our lives, and the forces arrayed against them, which range from regulation to apathy, aren't having a substantial impact. To the extent that the five companies face meaningful competition, it is usually from other members of the group; that is, one of the five might steal market share from another without affecting the overall dynamic in the tech business. Why is this happening? If you dig into their reports, you find several powerful forces keeping these companies at the top. Back when it was just an e-commerce company, Amazon was dogged by a persistent worry: Could it ever make a lot of money? The company has spent more than two decades methodically building out its capacity to deliver an ever larger number of products at an ever-increasing rate. That takes a lot of investment, so even though Amazon's sales grew like crazy every year, it had to plow its revenue back into further expansion. Three years ago, Amazon began to report small but consistent profits. And in the last year, its earnings began to grow, and now they've reached a level that stands out even in the tech industry. In the quarter ending in June, Amazon booked a $2.5 billion profit. That's only about half what Facebook made, but it is real money. Where did Amazon find all the new money? The same place the tech industry always finds profits: software. Though most people think of Amazon as a place to buy toilet paper, the vast majority of its profits come from its cloud-services business, Amazon Web Services, which allows companies to store their data on Amazon's servers rather than locally. Another new source of profits is its advertising business, which charges companies to place ads for their products across Amazon's site. For rival retailers, Amazon's new profitability constitutes a kind of nightmare scenario. By shuttling profits from software into its retail business, Amazon can keep expanding its store at a breakneck pace. ""These high-margin businesses allow Amazon to run its entire store at close to zero margin — and once you do that, it becomes effectively impossible for someone whose sole business is commerce to compete with you,"" said Youssef Squali, an analyst at the firm SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. But it's not just Amazon that's profiting under the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen's thesis that ""software is eating the world."" Microsoft's surging earnings were also driven by its cloud business, while Apple's software services — things like sales of apps, music subscriptions, cloud storage and Apple Pay — are the fastest-growing part of its business. The European Union recently fined Google $5.1 billion for abusing its mobile software monopoly, which followed a $2.7 billion fine last year for abuse of its search monopoly. (Google is appealing both decisions.) Apple agreed last year to pay nearly $16 billion in back taxes to the European Union over its cozy tax deal with Ireland. (The funds will be held in escrow while Ireland appeals the decision; Apple has disputed any wrongdoing.) Facebook, which has been hauled before lawmakers in Europe and the United States for its role in politics, faces threats of increased regulation and possible fines for mishandling private data. But Big Tech's earnings so far don't show much of an impact from the increased scrutiny. Google paid its fine and still reported a $3.2 billion quarterly profit. Neither Google nor Facebook saw much of an effect from Europe's new privacy rule, the General Data Protection Regulation. Facebook's user base declined by only a million users in Europe (367 million people use it every month there). Both companies warned that the law may have a greater effect in the future, but several analysts said both Google and Facebook could benefit from the law, because compliance costs could sink their smaller rivals. There is also the possibility that regulatory zeal will abate. Google watchers say it's notable that President Trump tweeted criticism of the European Union's fine against Google, suggesting, perhaps, that American regulators won't take up a similar case. (Of course, it is hard these days to really know how much to read into a presidential tweet.) Or consider the changing dynamics of the digital advertising business, which is dominated by Google and Facebook and has been a top target of antitrust activists. Amazon's growing ad business poses a threat to both Google and Facebook — which suggests that the ad economy is becoming more competitive even without the government's help. ""There's been this fear that advertising was going to become a duopoly owned by Google and Facebook,"" Mr. Mahaney said. ""Now it's going to be a triopoly — but if you were worried about the duopoly, you're probably saying, 'Couldn't the third company have been someone besides Amazon?'"" Finally, there are what Mr. Mahaney calls the ""green fields"" — the nearly endless opportunities that many of the Five have to start minting more and more money from various parts of their businesses. Facebook, for instance, has experienced a slowdown in the growth of its core social network, but its other properties — Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp among them — are still growing quickly, and the company has only just started to make money from them. At Google, there's a similar opportunity for YouTube, which, like Facebook, will benefit from the billions in TV advertising money that marketers will shift online over the next few years. And that's just in the short term. The earnings reports show that all of the five are investing heavily in the tech that will dominate the future, from artificial intelligence to voice services to self-driving cars. ""The one thing that is likely to keep these companies at the top for much longer than traditional megacap companies is that they are not afraid to reinvent themselves,"" Mr. Squali said. ""They see themselves as laboratories for new ideas, and they're not afraid to destroy something that's working today to make the longer-term work even better for them."" In other words: Get used to the Five. They're not going anywhere."

0,2018-08-02," It has happened as steadily, and stealthily, as Amazon's relentless march to vie with Apple for the title of world's most valuable company.  What am I talking about? The ascension, unavoidable when this sort of spotlight falls on you, of Jeff Bezos, a.k.a., the richest man in the world, to full-fledged style icon. You can't ignore it anymore. As his company's figurehead, he's simply too ubiquitous. In the vacuum left by Steve Jobs, amid the uncertain status of the gray T-shirt-and-hoodie proponent Mark Zuckerberg (thanks to Facebook's changing fortunes), and as an alternative to the Hollywood velvets of Elon Musk and the folksiness of Tim Cook, Mr. Bezos offers a new kind of image of a tech titan. According to Joseph Rosenfeld, a personal style adviser who specializes in the tech world in Silicon Valley and New York, and whose clients work at companies like Apple, Intuit and Google, ""he is doing something with style that differentiates him from any one else in tech. We have seen him sharpen up, with a wardrobe rooted in tradition but also very modernist and minimal. It creates a focus on him, and has evolved in accordance with his business."" It's a transformation that in many ways is as unexpected as Amazon's swerves into original moviemaking and web services.  Yet there's no mistaking the New Look. Mr. Bezos has gone from a pleated-pants sweatshirt-wearing Smurf to muscled-up, black-polo-shirt-and-shades digi-stud. His thinning mud-brown scruff of hair has been shaved rigorously clean, and his biceps have grown bulgy. His tailoring has narrowed, and he has acquired an entire wardrobe of bomber jackets. His accessories have begun to speak mogul semiology: a Ulysse Nardin Dual Time watch, Garrett Leight Van Buren sunglasses, cowboy boots. His look has become so striking that it has inspired all sort of flowery comparisons to pop culture figures like Pitbull (by Spin) and ""Terminator-meets-Vin-Diesel-in-Portland"" (BuzzFeed). In 2015, GeekWire voted him best-dressed at the tech summit with the Chinese president Xi Jinping, beating out Mr. Cook, Satya Nadella of Microsoft, Mr. Zuckerberg, Alibaba's Jack Ma and the LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, among others. It's a pretty far cry from this description of his clothing style from a Wired profile in 1999: Snaps! What was he thinking? He was apparently already focused on saving time, even in those early years. When did the evolution begin? It's hard to pinpoint. Possibly around the time Mr. Bezos really began to articulate his ambitions to Amazon-ify the fashion world (ambitions that still largely elude him as far as high fashion is concerned, though Morgan Stanley has predicted the company will soon become the largest apparel retailer in the United States). In 2012, he stood on the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in a Tom Ford tuxedo as the honorary chair of the Met Gala. At the time, many people, including this writer, made fun of the conjunction. Perhaps we should have paid more attention to the fact that, in an interview with The New York Times just after the Met event, while Mr. Bezos could not remember the make of his shirt or shoes, he did manage to name-check his Prada jeans. Something had changed. And thus did it continue when he bought The Washington Post the next year, which was followed last year by the purchase of the biggest house in Washington, where it's been suggested that Mr. Bezos could become the next Kay Graham. Though perhaps its clearest expression occurred when he joined Instagram in 2017. Many of his posts focus on Blue Origin and Mr. Bezos's dream of spaceflight, though some also acknowledge his evolution in a backhanded way by poking fun, somewhat, at his new style. There he is, for example, arm veins a-popping, next to a poster of the even balder and more built Dwayne Johnson in ""Rampage,"" with the caption: ""Still working on my smolder."" There he is with Patrick Stewart in matching tuxedos at the Vanity Fair Oscars party earlier this year (Bezos is a famous Trekkie), a photo that provoked many commentators to remark on their similarity. There he is in the desert in faded denim, a cowboy hat, those ""lucky"" cowboy boots (apparently a gift from a friend) and shades leaning against his space capsule and striking a ""Right Stuff"" pose. And there he is with robot dogs and spaceships, and atop a giant windmill in Amazon's new wind farm, modeling a hard hat and shades and smashing a Champagne bottle. Which leads inevitably to thoughts of Tony Stark. Indeed, in November 2017 Mr. Bezos wore a jeans-black-polo-leather-jacket combination to Summit LA17 that echoed, almost exactly, the jeans-black-T-shirt-leather-jacket look Robert Downey Jr. modeled in ""Iron Man 2."" He is getting more comfortable playing the public role, and costuming himself for it, down to the squared-off handkerchief in his breast pocket when he wears a suit, which he does in the company of political power folk. When around journalists and in his own backyard, he tends to lose the tie and opt for a perfectly fitted sports jacket and contrasting straight trousers. Pointedly, and unlike his fellow tech entrepreneurs who have enshrined the dress-down uniform in the mythology of their sector and equated it with a life of the mind, Mr. Bezos has a facility for dressing up. He has also shown a willingness to sample outfits, much as he samples industries, the better to make them his own. It's an expression of an omnivorous, rather than laserlike, focus. The result is a new model for a major tech entrepreneur. If Amazon does win the race to the trillion-dollar mark, look for it coming soon to a Silicon Alley near you."

0,2018-08-05," Jared Evans, a member of the Indianapolis City-County Council, is proud that the city is among 20 finalists for one of the most coveted prizes in the country: the planned second headquarters of Amazon. He does, however, have one small question: What financial incentives did his city dangle in front of Amazon? ""What have I been told?"" Mr. Evans said. ""Absolutely nothing."" Across the country, the search for HQ2, as the project has been nicknamed, is shrouded in secrecy. Even civic leaders can't find out what sort of tax credits and other inducements have been promised to Amazon. And there is a growing legal push to find out, because taxpayers could get saddled with a huge bill and have little chance to stop it. ""The only time the public may become aware if the city has promised Amazon incentives is if we win and then we need to get those incentives passed,"" Mr. Evans said. A primary reason for the information blackout is that, in many cases, the bids were handled by local private Chamber of Commerce affiliates or economic development groups that aren't required to make their negotiations public. Many of the groups are also not covered by Freedom of Information Act or state open-records requests. But another reason is gamesmanship. Some cities say they want their Amazon proposals to remain confidential to avoid showing their hand to rivals. And Amazon required the finalists to sign nondisclosure agreements that forbid the local groups to release proprietary information about the company. ""I don't know what we offered Amazon in terms of financial incentives, but I believe Amazon wants to see the biggest incentive package that any city will offer them,"" said Leslie Pool, a member of the Austin City Council. The city, also a finalist, submitted a bid put together by the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce, which had no consultations with the City Council. With so much secrecy — and bids like Austin's that involve unelected officials making promises — there is the risk that taxpayers and their civic leaders will be forced to accept the proposed terms or live with turning down an enormously lucrative opportunity. Amazon, which is expected to make $235 billion in revenue this year, promises to bring the winning location up to 50,000 high-paying jobs and a $5 billion investment in construction. When the competition was announced last year, 238 places vied to be considered. In January, that list was winnowed to 20 finalists, which are now waiting to find out whether their communities will land the project. There is widespread speculation that the company could cut the field down again as soon as this month, asking for best-and-final offers. Amazon has not offered any updates, and a spokesman declined to answer questions about the process or the company's plans on the record. The few bids that have become public are breathtaking financial packages that indicate just how much states are willing to pony up to woo Amazon. Maryland put together an $8.5 billion tax incentive and infrastructure bid, and local and state officials in New Jersey got legislative approval to offer Amazon $7 billion in tax credits and incentives to pick Newark. But that kind of transparency is the exception. ""We are not releasing documents related to Amazon HQ2. We are not subject to F.O.I.A.,"" Michael Finney, the president and chief executive of the Miami-Dade Beacon Council, a public-private partnership that handled the Amazon bid, said in an email. Similar requests to Austin, Atlanta and Indianapolis met with similar responses. And when officials in Montgomery County, Md., did respond to a request for information on their bid, they delivered, among other items, a 10-page document of incentives — with every single line of text redacted. Newark released its proposal only after a citizen filed a lawsuit, and officials in other places are fighting legal challenges. The mayor's office of Chicago is pushing back against a transparency-seeking public advocacy group; Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Pennsylvania are challenging rulings by the state Office of Open Records that said the cities' pitches should be made entirely public. Companies are often stealthy when searching for a location for a critical factory or relocating a headquarters, as General Electric or Bechtel have done in recent years. And it has been reported that Apple has been holding behind-closed-doors meetings with government leaders as it shops for a new corporate campus. It is also not unusual for states to offer up significant tax credits and incentives to attract businesses to their region. Tesla was wooed with as much as $1.3 billion in tax breaks and incentives to build its $5 billion lithium-ion battery cell factory outside of Reno, Nev., and Foxconn has received close to $4 billion in incentives to build its $10 billion megaplant in southeastern Wisconsin. In the case of Amazon, it is the size and scope of its search that some officials find shocking — and galling. ""Typically, you see companies bid a couple of places against each other as they try to land a corporate deal,"" said Brad Lander, a member of the New York City Council who has not seen the city's proposal to Amazon. (New York is a finalist.) ""This process is highly unusual. It creates a real race-to-the-bottom aspect with the potential of companies bidding multiple cities against one another."" It is unclear how much promised tax credits and financial incentives will weigh into Amazon's decision. Three of the first four questions Amazon asked cities to answer in their proposals were centered on incentives. But the e-commerce giant also sought information on possible building sites, the local labor force, transit options, computer science programs in local schools and cost-of-living data. In what it did made public, Washington, D.C., pitched the idea of Amazon University, with a customized curriculum developed in partnership with Amazon and local universities. Boston, in its 218-page proposal, provided a sleek rendering of how Amazon's second headquarters would look at Suffolk Downs, a former horse track in East Boston. And Toronto's pitch highlighted its high quality of life, including low crime rates and universal health care, and Canada's progressive policies, including embracing same-sex marriage and remaining a signatory of the Paris Climate Accord. ""We build doors, not walls,"" the proposal said. The cities see more at stake than just the jobs and investment that Amazon's second headquarters would bring. Amazon says its presence and investment in Seattle have created an additional 53,000 jobs beyond its own direct hires and added $38 billion to Seattle's economy from 2010 to 2016. But there have also been serious downsides for the city. In a be-careful-of-what-you-ask-for address to the U.S. Conference of Mayors this summer, Mayor Jenny Durkan of Seattle said that housing prices in her city average $824,000, that rents have soared 57 percent in the last five years and that there are 4,000 homeless people on the streets every night. Those are the types of concerns raised by Ms. Pool, the Austin councilwoman. Ms. Pool said she thought her city lacked the infrastructure and housing to accommodate 50,000 high-paying jobs and that such fast growth would alter the city's socioeconomic makeup and quality of life. ""This is a city where you want to put down roots,"" Ms. Pool said. ""The people here are the friendliest. The parks are beautiful. But if someone like Amazon comes in, a big con is the massive amount of dislocation it causes. You put out the small businesses and longtime property owners, the very businesses and people that give the city its flavor and, I would argue, its brand."" Still, the project is too good to pass up, even for some of the nation's mayors who are most focused on housing and affordability, such as Bill de Blasio of New York and Rahm Emanuel of Chicago. ""They are about ending inequality and creating more inclusive cities,"" said Richard Florida, a professor at the School of Cities and the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto. ""Now they're in a game competing with one another to throw money at one of the most powerful companies in the world run by one of the world's richest men."" Mr. Florida was on the board of directors for Toronto Global, whose bid is one of the 20 finalists, but he said he resigned this year so that he could raise concerns about the general lack of transparency in the bidding. ""I think the lack of transparency of this whole process is galling,"" he said. ""This has to be all out in the public. This is taxpayer money."" Eventually, the taxpayers whose area wins will have to be told how much money Amazon was promised. And when they discover how much they will have to hand over, Mr. Florida said, ""there is going to be hell to pay."""

1,2018-08-08," Amazon has found itself in the rare position of playing catch-up with its rivals. The e-commerce giant announced Wednesday that its Whole Foods stores will allow customers to order their groceries online and pick them up in person. Walmart, the nation's largest grocer, already offers online grocery pickup in nearly 1,800 stores across the United States, and plans to roll out the service to as many as 2,200 stores by the end of the year. Amazon's new service is starting in Sacramento and Virginia Beach. Shoppers who pay the Amazon Prime subscription fee — $12.99 a month or $119 a year — can order their groceries online and pick them up 30 minutes later at a Whole Foods. The latest move comes as Amazon and Walmart vie head-to-head for dominance of America's shifting retail landscape. Amazon continues to rule pure online shopping, but Walmart has been making inroads by incorporating digital shopping with its vast network of super centers. Fresh food is where the competition is perhaps the most fierce because customers shop for it so frequently. Retailers may be doubling down on their online grocery offerings, but is this what consumers want? Apparently not. A recent research report by analysts at Morgan Stanley says retailers still haven't quite convinced shoppers of the merits of online grocery shopping. Among shoppers who have never tried ordering groceries online, polled as part of the investment bank's annual survey, 65 percent said it's because they prefer to physically see food before they buy it. They want to see the strawberries and feel the avocados themselves. But among digital options, ""click and collect"" services, as they're called, seem to be attracting more shoppers than services that ship directly to your home. More shoppers are willing to order fresh foods — like cheese and fruits — online and pick them up in the store, rather than have them delivered, according to Morgan Stanley. Retailers are trying to be sensitive to concerns about freshness. Last week, when Walmart unveiled a new automated system designed to help its store workers assemble online orders more efficiently, the retailer made a point to note that human workers, not machines, would still pick the fruits and vegetables. For Amazon, new services like online grocery pickup are a test of whether it can integrate its digital prowess with its recently acquired brick-and-mortar network of Whole Foods. But Amazon has a long way to go in denting Walmart's dominance. With a 23 percent share of grocery spending, Walmart sold more than twice as much food as the second largest national grocer, Kroger, over the last three months. Whole Foods captured just 2 percent of grocery spending, according to Morgan Stanley."

0,2018-08-21," Chieh Huang spent years trying to get grocery industry executives excited about the technology at Boxed, his grocery e-commerce company. He regularly gave tours of the company's state-of-the-art fulfillment centers, featuring a custom software system and roving bands of autonomous carts. But interest in Boxed, which is not profitable and crossed $100 million in revenue in 2016, was lukewarm. ""They were like, 'What a cute lemonade stand,'"" Mr. Huang said. That changed a year ago when Amazon bought Whole Foods Market. The $13.4 billion deal shook the grocery world, setting off a frenzy of deals and partnerships that continues to intensify. Traditional retailers pursued digital technology, and online companies reconsidered their relationship with brick-and-mortar retail. Kroger announced a partnership with Ocado, an online grocery company, to use its robots to pack online orders. Target acquired Shipt, a start-up offering same-day delivery services, for $550 million. Walmart acquired Parcel, a start-up offering same-day delivery, and announced a partnership to use Alert Innovation, a small company that employs automated carts to fulfill grocery pickup orders at stores. And on Tuesday, Boxed announced that it had sold a minority stake to Aeon Group, one of the largest retail chains in Japan. Alongside investors including Alpha Square Group and CDIB Capital, Aeon invested $110 million in Boxed. The deal values the start-up at $600 million, according to a person familiar with the agreement. ""Are technology folks like us going to figure out retail faster than the retailers figure out technology?"" Mr. Huang asked. ""In some ways we're all kind of fighting the same fight against the gigantic folks online."" Food shopping is one of the last major holdouts to online retail. Groceries are unique in that their inventory is perishable, fragile and heavy. Grocery customers often shop at the last minute, like to see the food they are about to eat and don't want to pay high delivery fees. Even Amazon, with its Amazon Fresh online grocery service, has struggled to gain ground in the business. The company's Whole Foods deal, paired with Walmart's 2016 acquisition of Jet.com, underscored that the future of selling food and household items requires cooperation between the digital natives and the old-school retailers. Grocery companies ""are realizing that with Walmart and Amazon moving at their pace, you need to pick yours up, too,"" said Greg Spragg, a former chief merchant at Sam's Club, the wholesale retailer owned by Walmart, who now consults at GrowthWise Group. ""I wouldn't call it fear. I would call it a wake-up call."" Walmart, the nation's largest grocer, declined to comment. Amazon did not provide a comment. Global food retailing is a $5 trillion business, and just 3 percent of the world's grocery spending happened online last year, according to Forrester Research. Online grocery sales are expected to double over the next four years, reaching $334 billion by 2022. Market research conducted by Morgan Stanley in July found that 56 percent of consumers who were likely to order groceries online said they would most likely order from Amazon, compared with 14 percent who would go to a mass merchandiser and 10 percent who would use their local supermarket. Phil Lempert, a grocery industry analyst, predicted store closings for chains that do not evolve to meet the changing needs of customers. Stores offering curated selections, specialty items, cooking classes and the option to buy online and pick up in person will thrive, he said. ""The bulk of stores — they haven't been doing exciting things for a long time,"" Mr. Lempert said. Josh Hix, chief executive of Plated, a meal kit start-up, said the Amazon-Whole Foods deal had immediately changed his discussions with grocery chains. Meal kit companies have a checkered record. But the grocery companies saw an opportunity to use Plated's data and research on recipes and taste preferences. ""The pace of follow-ups went from 'This is interesting, and we'll be in New York again in five months' to 'This is really interesting, and how's tomorrow at 9 a.m. look for another call?'"" he said. After years of not being taken seriously, ""it was very cathartic."" Plated held deal conversations over the summer with ""virtually everybody"" in the industry, Mr. Hix said. In September, it sold to Albertsons, a large grocery chain. At the time, Albertsons' chief executive, Bob Miller, said the deal was ""the latest example of Albertsons Companies meeting our customers wherever and however they like to shop."" Mr. Huang also fielded numerous acquisition offers for Boxed, creating a harrowing few months. Most of the big grocers ""have wanted to kill us, partner with us, invest in us or buy us — all probably in the course of the same conversation,"" he said. Mr. Huang, who previously founded a gaming company that was sold to Zynga, decided that the opportunity was too good to sell now. He opted to take the investment from Aeon instead. The ownership structure allows Boxed to license its technology to its retail competitors in the United States as they try to become more digital. The company is in talks with 10 or so potential partners for various pieces of its technology. They include mobile app technology, personalization software, a packing algorithm that maximizes space in shipping boxes, software that tracks item expiration dates, order management software and warehouse robotics automation. Boxed, which is based in New York City and has about 250 full-time employees, sells food and other everyday essentials in bulk. It has built a sizable business supplying snacks and office goods to companies and also earns revenue selling ads to suppliers to promote their items in its e-commerce site and app. Mr. Huang spoke about the deal with Aeon from Boxed's New Jersey fulfillment center, as a self-driving cart rolled around the corner and slid sideways toward a shelf, waiting for a worker to place a box of Pampers or a can of Planters on its back. Nearby, a three-story automated wall of plastic tubs rearranged itself, while workers dropped handwritten notes to customers into boxes before taping them shut. Grocery delivery is difficult to do affordably, but tech-driven efficiencies like those developed by Boxed, Amazon and others have forced change on the industry. ""Consumers want convenience and will pay more for it,"" said Michael Pachter, an equities analyst at Wedbush Securities. ""Once they stop going to grocery stores,"" he added, ""grocery stores are going to have a problem."""

2,2018-08-23," New video footage from a drone shows the first images of members of an isolated Amazon tribe that had no known contact with the outside world, the Brazilian government said this week. The video, released on Wednesday, shows a clearing of felled trees in the Javary River valley, near Brazil's border with Peru, and figures walking through it, one of them carrying what appears to be a spear or pole. The images were captured by an expedition by the National Indian Foundation, a government agency commonly known as Funai. The agency also released still photos taken by a team on the ground, including images of canoes made of hollowed-out palm tree trunks and an ax with a stone blade tied to a wooden handle, along with an aerial photo of a thatched hut. The region has eight indigenous peoples who have had some contact with the outside world, and at least 11 others without any known contact, Funai said in a statement. The agency said its team had traveled more than 110 miles in ""boats, trucks, motorcycles"" and about 75 miles ""on foot through dense forest"" to reach the location. [A lone survivor of a tribe in the Amazon was recently filmed on video.] The team, accompanied by the police, caught two groups of outsiders hunting illegally, and found a landowner and farmers encroaching illegally on land reserved for indigenous groups, Funai added. Such encroachment and destruction of the rain forest, often accompanied by violence against the indigenous peoples, threaten their survival. Last month, Funai released video of a man in another part of Brazil who is thought to be the last surviving member of his tribe."

1,2018-08-31," NEW DELHI — In India, American companies dominate the internet. Facebook's WhatsApp is the most popular app on phones. Virtually every smartphone runs on Google's Android system. YouTube is the favorite video platform and Amazon is the No. 2 online retailer. For some Indian political leaders, it is as if their nation — which was ruled by Britain for a century until 1947 — is being conquered by colonial powers all over again. And they are determined to stop it. ""As a country, we have to all grow up and say that, you know, enough of this,"" Vinit Goenka, a railways official who works on technology policy for India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party, said at a conference last week. In recent months, regulators and ministers across India's government have declared their intention to impose tough new rules on the technology industry. Collectively, the regulations would end the free rein that American tech giants have long enjoyed in this country of 1.3 billion people, which is the world's fastest-growing market for new internet users. The proposals include European-style limits on what big internet companies can do with users' personal data, a requirement that tech firms store certain sensitive data about Indians only within the country, and restrictions on the ability of foreign-owned e-commerce companies to undercut local businesses on price. The policy changes unfolding in India would be the latest to crimp the power — and profits — of American tech companies, and they may well contribute to the fracturing of the global internet. In May, Europe put into effect a sweeping new privacy law that gives Europeans more control over what information is being collected on them. In the United States, California just passed a privacy law that gives state residents more protections than Americans at large. As India sets the new rules of the game, it is seeking inspiration from China. Although India does not want to go as far as China, which has cut off its internet from the global one, officials admire Beijing's tight control over citizens' data and how it has nurtured homegrown internet giants like Alibaba and Baidu by limiting foreign competition. At the same time, regulators do not want to push out the American internet services that hundreds of millions of Indians depend on. For Google, Facebook, Amazon and others, India's moves would curb a lucrative business avenue — especially after so many of them were blocked in China. India had become the companies' next frontier for growth. Salman Waris, an expert in international technology law at TechLegis in New Delhi, said India was trying to establish strong data protections for its citizens, as Europe did, while giving the government the right to obtain private information as it sees fit, much as China does. Foreign tech companies will have little choice but to go along. ""Everyone is going to fall in line and do what is necessary,"" Mr. Waris said. ""These companies have to do it in China and Europe, and they will do it here."" India's new policies are still a work in progress, with competing government agencies jousting with foreign and domestic lobbyists and policy advocates to shape them. But new restrictions are definitely coming, said officials and industry executives involved in the process. The country's Supreme Court declared last summer that Indians have a fundamental right to privacy and pushed Parliament to pass a data privacy law. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his B.J.P. party have embraced an India-first economic nationalism to address weak job growth ahead of elections next year. Law enforcement authorities are also demanding more legal tools to extract private customer data from WhatsApp, Facebook and financial firms. ""We don't want to build walls, but at the same time, we explicitly recognize and appreciate that data is a strategic asset,"" said Aruna Sundararajan, the nation's secretary of telecommunications, who has been deeply involved in the policy discussions. ""There is a strong feeling in many quarters that the reason that India has not been able to develop a Tencent or Baidu or Alibaba is because we have not been nuanced in our policies."" The Indian government, which sees data as vital to a whole new generation of technologies such as artificial intelligence, appears particularly determined to reel in Facebook and its WhatsApp messaging service. Officials were furious after the Cambridge Analytica scandal this year revealed that Facebook had shared private information on 87 million users, including 560,000 Indians, with a political consulting firm that had sought to influence Indian elections. More recently, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has demanded that WhatsApp create a way to track and stop mass messages, such as a series of false items about child kidnappers that led to the murder of two dozen innocent people by angry mobs. WhatsApp has refused, saying that building such technology would break the encryption that keeps messages private. The government, for its part, is holding up a new Indian payments service from WhatsApp until it complies with local laws, including a new rule that requires financial data to be stored only in India. More broadly, the Indian government says it wants to ensure that Indian and foreign companies have to follow the same rules on taxes, data storage, security, pricing and cooperation with law enforcement. For example, Indian travel agencies complain that current tax laws allow foreign services such as Booking.com to avoid collecting hotel taxes, which can run as high as 28 percent of the room price. The disparity, they say, gives foreign firms a price advantage. ""It's not about protectionism. It's about saying if 10 laws apply to me, the 10 laws should also apply to someone else operating in India,"" said Rameesh Kailasam, chief executive of IndiaTech.org, a newly formed lobbying group that represents local investors and start-ups, including MakeMyTrip and the ride-hailing company Ola. In a statement, Booking.com said it made a ""full effort"" to comply with Indian tax laws. The big American technology companies are trying to fend off or dilute the regulations behind closed doors. Many consider the topic so sensitive that they refused to discuss it on the record. In private, the companies say that the proposals would raise their costs, dampen their ability to use Indian data to improve services and dissuade investments like Walmart's recent $16 billion deal to buy control of Flipkart, the country's leading online retailer. They also warned that India has fewer legal protections than the United States against government searches and data requests, so private data stored in the country could more easily end up in the hands of the police. The issue may become a topic in trade and economic discussions between the United States and Indian governments scheduled for the fall. Mukesh Aghi, the chief executive of the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum, a policy group whose board includes top executives at Cisco, Adobe, and Mastercard, said that India risked hurting its own economy by imposing stringent rules on foreign tech companies. Forcing data to be stored in India, for example, could prompt similar rules from the United States, which would hurt India's big outsourcing companies. India also needs multinational companies to build its tech economy, he said. ""It requires deep pockets. It requires world-class technologies. It requires a global supply chain,"" Mr. Aghi said. ""These companies are creating jobs."" Ajay Sawhney, the information technology secretary, who is helping to draft the regulations, said the government was keeping an open mind as it developed the final rules. ""Our framework will be fair to all stakeholders,"" he said. ""We deeply appreciate the value that the tech companies and their platforms bring to our country."""

0,2018-09-03," Verizon doesn't sell its mobile phones or wireless plans over Amazon. Nor does it offer Fios, its high-speed internet service. But Verizon does advertise on Amazon. On Black Friday last year, when millions of online shoppers took to Amazon in search of deals, a Verizon ad for a Google Pixel 2 phone — buy one and get a second one half off — could be seen blazing across Amazon's home page. And on July 16, what Amazon calls Prime Day, an event with special deals for its Prime customers, Verizon again ran a variety of ads and special offers for Amazon shoppers, like a mix-and-match unlimited service plan. Amazon, which has already reshaped and dominated the online retail landscape, is quickly gathering momentum in a new, highly profitable arena: online advertising, where it is rapidly emerging as a major competitor to Google and Facebook. The push by the giant online retailer means consumers — even Prime customers, who pay $119 a year for access to free shipping as well as streaming music, video and discounts — are likely to be confronted by ads in places where they didn't exist before. In late August, some gamers were angered when Twitch, a video game streaming service acquired by Amazon in 2014, said it would soon no longer be ad-free for Prime members unless consumers paid an additional $8.99 a month for a premium service called Twitch Turbo. Amazon derives the bulk of its annual revenue, forecast to be $235 billion this year, from its e-commerce business, selling everything from books to lawn furniture. Amazon is also a leader in the cloud computing business, with Amazon Web Services, which accounts for around 11 percent of its revenue but more than half of its operating income. But in the company's most recent financial results, it was a category labeled ""other"" that caught the attention of many analysts. It mostly consists of revenue from selling banner, display and keyword search-driven ads known as ""sponsored products."" That category surged by about 130 percent to $2.2 billion in the first quarter, compared with the same period in 2017. Those numbers are a pittance for Google and Facebook, which make up more than half of the $88 billion digital ad market. But they come with big and troubling implications for those two giants. Much of online advertising relies on imprecise algorithms that govern where marketing messages appear, and what impact they have on actual sales. Here, Amazon has a big advantage over its competitors. Thanks to its wealth of data and analytics on consumer shopping habits, it can put ads in front of people when they are more likely to be hunting for specific products and to welcome them as suggestions rather than see them as intrusions. Amazon is gaining in advertising when the public perception of Google and Facebook has soured. In addition, some advertisers have yet to return to YouTube, a growing ad channel for Google, after brands like AT&T were found appearing adjacent to videos that promoted racism or terrorism. ""Google and Facebook have been slow to create the standards that advertisers want to see,"" said Collin Colburn, an analyst at the research and advisory firm Forrester. ""They are concerned about what sort of content their ads are going to be placed next to."" He added, ""Amazon is different because it has a much more controlled environment on its e-commerce site where the products are being sold, and Amazon's reach into the rest of the World Wide Web is pretty small."" Amazon has sold some forms of advertising for years, including sponsored product listings tied to search keywords on its site, and ads on properties it owns like IMDb and Zappos. The company will also sell advertising spots on the Thursday-night National Football League games it live-streams to Prime customers this fall. But some analysts who follow the company closely say Amazon is now focusing more on advertising, rapidly hiring and building out its capabilities in a business with high profit margins for Google and Facebook. In turn, brands are increasingly recognizing Amazon's vast customer reach, particularly to its more than 100 million Prime subscribers. In a study conducted last summer by Catalyst, the search and social media marketing company, only 15 percent of the 250 brands marketers polled felt they were making the most out of advertising on Amazon's platform, and 63 percent of the companies already advertising there said they planned to increase their budget in the coming year. Many big brands that sell products on Amazon have increased their advertising on the site this year, including General Mills, Hershey and Unilever, according to an analysis of display ads by the research firm Gartner L2. But the bigger surprise is the increase in advertising on Amazon by companies, like Verizon, AT&T and the insurer Geico, that don't directly sell any product or service on the site. In the first half of 2018, Geico ran six times as many display ads as it did during the same period last year, according to Oweise Khazi, associate director of Amazon IQ research at Gartner L2. (Geico declined to comment.) Verizon said the reason for its increased advertising spending on Amazon was simple: It's where the shoppers are. ""They have people who are in a shopping mind-set, so that's valuable for Verizon to be seen as a resource within that mind-set,"" said John Nitti, the chief media officer at Verizon. Thanks to the vast amount of data Amazon collects from its customers, it can target ads not only to basic demographics — say, women over the age of 35 — but to a more precise segment of customers who are likely to be shopping for cellphones or barbecue grills. Amazon is not just selling ads online. For Verizon, the opportunities to advertise over Amazon may increase as the e-commerce giant continues to build its internal media group and opens new advertising spots on various platforms or devices. Verizon, for instance, will soon be running a test: It will put Fios advertisements on Amazon packages being delivered to ZIP codes where Verizon offers the service. In many cases, the advertising dollars that are moving to Amazon are being diverted from other digital players. Last year, the jeans maker Levi Strauss & Company shifted some of its advertising spending away from YouTube to Amazon, where it sharply increased its use of display ads, according to a May report by Gartner L2. In doing so, Levi's increased the brand's visibility in Google searches, driving shoppers to an Amazon page with Levi's merchandise, the research firm said. In an emailed statement, a spokeswoman for Levi's said the company had increased its marketing investment across all channels, including television, traditional digital and newer digital platforms, including Amazon. For some brands, the increased spending is most likely directly linked to increased competition on Amazon's platform from Amazon itself. As Amazon introduces more of its own private-label goods, many companies are expanding their advertising spending to raise the visibility of their products. On a recent afternoon, a consumer who typed ""cereal"" into the search bar of Amazon's browser would first see an ad for JoyBol, followed by similar ads for General Mills' Corn Chex and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. But just below those ads, in a box labeled ""Top Rated From Our Brands,"" a number of cereals from 365 Everyday Value were featured. That is the private label of the grocer Whole Foods, which Amazon acquired in 2017. General Mills declined to comment. Kellogg Company, which faces much of the same competition, said it had been generally shifting advertising dollars toward digital platforms. ""With Amazon's platform now being a leader in many elements of advertising — including, for many categories, search — it makes sense for part of those ad dollars to be allocated there,"" said Monica McGurk, Kellogg's chief revenue and e-commerce officer, in an emailed response to questions. But for Kellogg's, what sets advertising on Amazon's platform apart from others, like Google or Twitter, is the online retailer's data. ""We can reach the right consumer at the right time using their wealth of data to target,"" Ms. McGurk said. ""Other traditional digital platforms do not have the level of purchase data that Amazon has on their customers."" Analysts say some brands, however, particularly those whose products now face competition from Amazon private-label goods, remain reluctant to advertise on the e-commerce giant's platform. ""I do hear some brands saying, 'We don't want to work with Amazon too much because they're going to get too much information from us,"" said Will Margaritis, a vice president for e-commerce at the ad agency 360i. ""I feel like that's overthinking it. Amazon has enough data to understand everything about any category it wants to be in."""
1,2018-09-03," Malls are being hollowed out. Shops are closing by the thousands. Retailers are going bankrupt. But it may be too early to declare the death of retail. Americans have started shopping more — in stores. From the garden section at Walmart to the diamond counters at Tiffany & Company, old-school retailers are experiencing some of their best sales growth in years. The strong revenues start with a roaring economy and an optimistic consumer. With more cash in their wallets from the tax cuts, Americans have been spending more. The boom also reflects a broad reordering of the $3.5 trillion industry, with fewer retailers capturing more of the gains. Stores that have learned how to match the ease and instant gratification of e-commerce shopping are flourishing, while those that have failed to evolve are in bankruptcy or on the brink. ""The retailers that get it recognize that Amazon has forever changed consumer behavior,"" said Barbara Kahn, a marketing professor and former director of the retailing center at the Wharton School. ""I shouldn't have to work to shop."" Many successful stores are now a cross between a fast-food drive-through and a hotel concierge. Target's shoppers can order sunscreen or a Tokidoki Unicorno T-shirt on their phone, pull up to the parking lot and have the items brought to their car. Nordstrom lets customers in some stores make returns by dropping their items into a box and walking out — no human interaction required. Walmart is employing 25,000 ""personal shoppers"" to select and package groceries for curbside pickup. In recent weeks, all three retailers reported stronger-than-expected sales growth for the quarter. Traffic to Target's stores and online sites grew at its fastest pace since the company began keeping a record a decade ago. Doomsayers have predicted that online shopping, led by Amazon, would one day conquer all of retail, rendering brick and mortar obsolete. As store closings set a record last year, no class of retailer was spared — with the carnage hitting Madison Avenue boutiques, shopping malls and big-box stores. In New York and elsewhere, many shops, big and small, continue to struggle. But the pace of closings has slowed, as the most unprofitable stores have been culled and the weakest companies have collapsed. At this time in 2017, nearly 5,700 stores had shut across the United States, according to Coresight Research, a retail analysis and advisory firm. So far this year, about 4,480 have closed. Some big retailers, like J. C. Penney and Sears, are still sputtering, despite closing lagging stores and sprucing up ones that remain open. But the stronger players are capitalizing on the industry's failures. Target said it was picking up new toy customers in the wake of the Toys ""R"" Us liquidation this spring. The rebound is feeding the broader economy. Hiring is up, with an average of roughly 50,000 retail jobs being added each month since February, according to the National Retail Federation. Last year, a wave of retail layoffs fueled fears about the long-term health of a huge part of the job market. One in about every 10 American workers is in retail. ""There has been a shakeout, and 2017 was seen as the bottom,"" said Melina Cordero, head of retail research for the Americas at the real estate firm CBRE. Far from retrenching, many retailers are expanding their physical presence or spending billions to overhaul existing stores. Dollar General plans to open 900 stores this year, as it deepens its reach into rural America with inexpensive food and clothing. The company is building a huge following in areas where there are fewer places to shop, particularly in the South and in parts of the Midwest. At the other end of the spectrum, Tiffany said it was embarking on a three-year renovation of its flagship store on Fifth Avenue — the setting for the classic film ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and a magnet for tourists. The newly renovated flagship will probably include expanded retail space as well as hospitality offerings, driven by the success of its in-store ""Blue Box"" Cafe, which on some days can have a wait list of more than 1,000 people and features a $32 ""Breakfast at Tiffany."" Tiffany's success is built almost entirely on its stores, which account for more than 90 percent of its revenues. ""We have big expectations for this project,"" Tiffany's chief executive, Alessandro Bogliolo, told analysts in a conference call last week. The renovation is expected to reduce the company's near-term profits, signaling the importance. One of the most ambitious and costly makeover attempts is taking place at Target. The retailer stormed across the American suburbs more than a decade ago, building hundreds of big-box stores known for affordable, hip clothing and furnishings. But many shoppers had grown tired of Target's cavernous stores, and its cool edge had slipped. Target has lately targeted a new market of young urbanites — with plans to open about 30 smaller stores in cities and near college campuses this year. Many of the new stores are supposed to be all things to all shoppers — what the industry calls an ""omni-channel"" experience. Customers can order online and pick up at the store. They can order online and have their purchases delivered home, in some cases, on the same day. Or they can visit the store; employees' starting salaries were raised in an effort to bolster retention and morale. ""Our stores are at the center of our strategy, and they are at the center of our success right now,"" Target's chief executive, Brian Cornell, said in a conference call last month after the retailer reported its largest quarterly sales growth in 13 years. Tiffany Tully, 33, said recent changes to her local Target in Minneapolis had made shopping there more pleasant. The clothing displays, she said, feel more carefully curated and ""appealing to the eye."" And she likes the convenience of returning Target items she buys online to the store rather than having to ship them, as with Amazon. ""Technically I am a millennial, but I like going to stores,"" said Ms. Tully, a stay-at-home mother. Retailers have been tweaking their store and online strategies for years. But it's only recently that Amazon's blistering success has prodded the incumbents to try to reinvent themselves. Ms. Kahn of the Wharton School said retailers could have made these improvements decades ago if they had focused on what shoppers wanted. ""Most people want to spend less time shopping, not more,"" said Ms. Kahn, whose book ""The Shopping Revolution"" describes the disruption in the retail industry. She said Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, had understood this when he pioneered the idea of one-click shopping. But many retailers have built their businesses around the opposite idea, like expansive stores that take hours to wade through and commissions that encourage employees to push certain products. The investments in the new stores and digital offerings are being made at an opportune time, when the strong economy is giving retailers the necessary cash. But any economic weakness could derail their progress before it takes root beyond a few good quarters. Amazon remains the omnipresent cloud, putting pressure on profits and forcing retailers to keep evolving. ""These are big shifts,"" said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a research and consulting firm. ""It is like turning around the Queen Mary. You can turn the rudder, but it takes time to gain a purchase."""

3,2018-09-04," SAN FRANCISCO — When Apple's market value crossed a trillion dollars last month, the reason was simple: It makes devices that a lot of people are willing to spend a lot of money on. Now Amazon has become the second American company to cross that once-unimaginable line. Its shares rose as high as $2,050.50 on Tuesday morning, pushing it over $1 trillion in value, before immediately falling back and then ending the day at $2,039.51, below the $1 trillion threshold. Amazon's founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is worth nearly as much as Bill Gates and Warren E. Buffett put together. This time, the explanation is more complicated. Amazon captures 49 cents of every e-commerce dollar in the United States. It employs more than 550,000 people and generates $178 billion in annual revenue. It sells everything from computing space to peanut butter to appointments with plumbers. But the thing it has always sold the most — to investors, customers, the news media — is excitement. In the beginning, Amazon was an exciting new way to shop for books: online. Then it was an exciting new way to read (Kindle e-books), an exciting new way to publish (CreateSpace), an exciting new way to power the internet (Amazon Web Services), an exciting new way to get deliveries (Amazon Prime), an exciting new way to make your house a high-tech outpost (Alexa). Long before Amazon went to Hollywood and began making movies, it was the star of its own show, generating vast amounts of attention just for being Amazon. No other company had ever managed to turn its lack of profit into such effective drama, or the question of what its next move would be. Amazon's search for a second headquarters — the company having run out of room and patience in its hometown, Seattle — set off a nationwide frenzy among politicians. Mr. Bezos even gamified his philanthropic plans, taking to Twitter to solicit advice about what he should do. (One popular recommendation: Pay your warehouse workers more.) Would Amazon collapse, or would it eat the world? It was the corporation-as-reality series, and it has been a long-running hit. Public companies usually live under the tyranny of Wall Street, which prizes profits to the exclusion of all else. When Facebook and Twitter recently purged their rolls of fake users and began devoting more effort to cleaning up their acts, Wall Street did not applaud this civic-minded move but pummeled their shares. Mr. Bezos made clear when Amazon went public in 1997 that he would not work for Wall Street, and the result was a company cast in an entirely different mold. It never feared losing money. In a real sense, there were no consequences for being wrong. [Read more about how the $1 trillion milestone reached by Apple and Amazon reflects the rise of powerful megacompanies.] Behind the drama is a relentless and sometimes scary ambition. Amazon is the Jay Gatsby of American companies, believing that tomorrow it will run faster, stretch its arms out farther, fulfill the desires of consumers in ways that no other business possibly could. You will live in Amazon's world, it says, and you will like it. The retailer has retained this futuristic luster even as Facebook, Twitter and Google, which promoted their own versions of technoparadise, have become suspect. It has retained its allure even as many of its ventures have tanked. Remember Kindle Singles? They were electronic articles hailed as the virtual reinvention of nonfiction. No one even noticed when the program fizzled. ""We like to go down unexplored alleys and see what's at the end. Sometimes they're dead ends,"" Mr. Bezos said in 2009. ""Sometimes they open up into broad avenues and we find something really exciting."" One of the great benefits for Amazon of this approach is that it is impossible to tell where reality ends and hype — or perhaps even madness — begins. Take Amazon's drone program, which it first announced on ""60 Minutes."" ""I know this looks like science fiction,"" Mr. Bezos said, as he showed a film of an unmanned vehicle delivering a package. ""It's not."" He said there were ""years of additional work"" to be done, but declared himself an optimist. Drone delivery, he predicted, would be a reality in ""four, five years."" That was December 2013. Roughly a million features were written about Amazon and its drones, nearly all with the subtext: Isn't this the coolest thing ever? Over the years, the company kept raising the stakes, as if they were not already high enough. Amazon applied a few years ago for a patent for an ""aerial fulfillment center"" that would float at 45,000 feet. Drones would fly out of it with your order and then glide down to your backyard. What delivery could possibly be important enough to merit such a crazy system? The patent has a suggestion: ""Prepared hot food."" We wanted flying cars, but we got flying burritos instead. The fulfillment center, which looks in drawings like a blimp tugging a warehouse, has other uses besides delivering dinner. It would drift down to 2,000 feet to what the patent calls ""the advertising altitude,"" where it would present information ""about items and/or services."" Perhaps it will be just like the movie ""Blade Runner,"" and the floating ads will trumpet the joys of working in Amazon's off-world colonies. The patent was granted this summer. Still not impressed? This year, Amazon got a patent to more or less bomb people with their packages. The drone would drop the burrito or Stephen King blockbuster from a height of as much as 25 feet, in theory cushioning the plunge with an airbag. Haye Kesteloo, senior editor of the news site DroneDJ, noted that there were many hurdles to routine delivery by drone, even if the vehicles are not being launched from airships. The claimed drone attack on President Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela will not help soothe nervous citizens. Nevertheless, Mr. Kesteloo, like Mr. Bezos, proclaims himself an optimist. ""Companies like Amazon will make routine drone deliveries to consumers by 2025,"" he said — only twice as far away as promised. There are reasons to be skeptical about even this schedule. But that's the magic of Amazon. Even if the drones do not pan out, they have kept attention focused on the company, fulfilling a different part of the business plan. There is scarcely any oxygen left to discuss the more contentious aspects of Amazon, like its scorn for taxes or its plans to capture much of local government purchasing. ""There is no doubt anymore,"" said Ron Nussbaum, who runs an investment management fund called Maverick Value in Los Angeles. ""The stock always goes up, and no one doubts it will keep going up."" Mr. Nussbaum, who emphasized that over all his investments were profitable, might be the last Amazon skeptic. ""It's an honor,"" he said. And an expensive one. Last year, when Amazon crossed $1,000 a share, he started buying ""put"" options — bets that the stock would decline. One of his puts has dropped 85 percent; another, 92 percent. Mr. Nussbaum is planning to buy more. He thinks people are confusing their impressions of Amazon the company with Amazon as an investment. ""If I fill up your gas tank for $1 but it costs me $2, you can say it's a great product, but it doesn't make any sense as a company,"" he said. Apple had profits of $48 billion last year. Amazon's were less than a tenth of that. If profits were all that mattered, Amazon should be worth about $100 billion, the size of United Technologies or Texas Instruments. That is nothing to sneeze at, but nothing to get people excited, either. [How Apple's $1 trillion valuation dwarfs that of other huge companies.] Even before Amazon hit $1 trillion, the milestone was old news. There was a poll on Facebook run by a group of young Wall Street investors. The question: Would Amazon or Apple be the first to hit $2 trillion? The vote was overwhelmingly in favor of Amazon. Dreams will always triumph over devices."

6,2018-09-04," BANGALORE, India — Only 10 percent of India's 1.3 billion people know English. Yet most of the country's e-commerce services have been offered only in English, closing off online shopping to the vast majority of people here. Now Amazon is aiming to break through that language barrier. The e-commerce giant on Tuesday offered a hearty ""namaste"" to this country's half a billion Hindi speakers by making its local website and apps available in India's most popular language. Users of the India site or app will be able to choose Hindi as their preferred language, much as American users can choose Spanish. Amazon's expansion into Hindi — its first foray into an Indian language, even as other companies have tried that strategy and pulled back — is vital to the company's ambition of making India its next big market. Amazon is already the No. 2 player in India's $33 billion e-commerce market and says it has about 150 million registered users here. But as it seeks to reach the country's farthest regions and appeal to less-educated customers in the world's fastest-growing pool of internet users, it has found that English is not enough. ""The next 100 million customers will have to be in the vernacular language,"" said Kishore Thota, director of customer experience and marketing for Amazon India. Mr. Thota said the company's research found that eight in 10 Indian customers would prefer to shop in a language other than English. ""The level of trust increases when they see something in their own language,"" he said in an interview at Amazon's India headquarters in Bangalore. Prominently serving Hindi-speaking customers could also help Amazon deflect the political pressure coming from New Delhi, where policymakers are considering ways to curb the power of foreign internet companies. If the Hindi versions of its site and apps are successful, Amazon plans to quickly add options to shop in other major Indian languages, such as Bengali, Tamil, Kannada and Telugu, which are dominant in regions outside the Hindi belt in the north. Amazon's Hindi site is the most ambitious attempt so far to serve Indian shoppers who do not speak English. Another e-commerce site, Snapdeal, tried local-language versions about three years ago, then abandoned them because few customers used them. Amazon is betting that the market is more ready now, especially as cheap mobile data means that Indian-language speakers are coming online at a brisk clip. Paytm, a digital payments company that operates the No. 3 online retailer, Paytm Mall, began allowing customers to make purchases in 10 Indian languages in October. About 15 percent of the site's customers do that, said Amit Sinha, who heads the digital marketplace. But most of Paytm's listings are still in English. Converting them to other languages requires Paytm to build new automated translation tools as well as to persuade sellers and brands to translate their own content. ""It's a multidimensional problem,"" Mr. Sinha said. For Amazon, creating a Hindi-language site and app was difficult from the start. When the company began building its Hindi app and site about two years ago, it first tried to run the English version through a translation algorithm. The result ""was completely illegible,"" Mr. Thota said. So the team went back to the drawing board, tapping people to translate key listings and steps in the purchase process into colloquial Hindi. They then showed samples to actual and potential customers, refined them and used the final versions to train the algorithms to do mass translation. Not everything has been translated yet, and Amazon is working with leading brands to convert their pages. People are also reviewing pages to make sure they look right, since there is often more than one way to translate an English phrase into Hindi. One challenge is that spoken Hindi mixes in a lot of English. Amazon decided that some words and phrases, like ""free,"" ""jeans"" and ""cash on delivery,"" should be kept in English but written using Hindi's Devanagari script. Language is just one barrier to increasing the number of online shoppers in India, which is adding 40 million internet users a year, according to a recent study by Bain, Google and the Omidyar Network, an investment firm. Most of the 390 million Indians with internet access use it to chat with friends and family, watch videos, listen to music, look for religious content and read the news, the study found. Just 40 percent transact online, and about one-third of those stop after one purchase. Roopa Kudva, who heads Omidyar's operations in India, said that buying something online is the last step in the journey of a new internet user. ""Indians are very comfortable experimenting on the internet,"" she said. ""But the moment it comes to making payments online, people think it's a very sophisticated thing that requires expert knowledge, and they shy away from it."" While being able to shop in a familiar language is important, she said, many of the global conventions of online shopping, such as the shopping cart, are unfamiliar to Indians, who are more used to going to a store and asking a shopkeeper to pull items from a shelf. Amazon said it realized that the Hindi version of its site would not suddenly solve those problems. ""It will make people feel a lot more comfortable that we understand them,"" said Amit Agarwal, the head of Amazon India. ""But we are focused on all the barriers that will ultimately transform how India buys and sells."" For example, Amazon offers customer support in half a dozen Indian languages, and today, more than half the queries are in languages other than English. The company has also signed up about 14,000 retail locations across India for its Amazon Easy program, in which a local shopkeeper helps customers place Amazon orders, receives packages and then delivers them. ""They provide basic customer service in a language the customer understands,"" Mr. Thota said. It is not clear how quickly other companies might follow. Flipkart, India's largest online retailer, has not begun offering its services in local languages. Walmart recently bought a majority stake in the company for $16 billion, and it is unclear what plans the American retailer has in that area. Google is also considering a move into e-commerce in India. It recently invested in the Chinese online retailer JD.com, and last week announced plans to turn its multilingual Indian payments app, Google Pay, into more of a portal through which offline and online merchants could handle transactions. By 2021, 73 percent of India's internet users will prefer to use languages other than English, compared with 57 percent in 2016, according to a study last year by KPMG and Google. Given those trends, every e-commerce site in India has to figure out a way to address the local-language problem. ""Anybody who is serious about this country will have to do it,"" said Mr. Sinha of Paytm."

1,2018-09-07," The dead books are on the top floor of Southern Methodist University's law library. ""Antitrust Dilemma."" ""The Antitrust Impulse."" ""Antitrust in an Expanding Economy."" Shelf after shelf of volumes ignored for decades. There are a dozen fat tomes with transcripts of the congressional hearings on monopoly power in 1949, when the world was in ruins and the Soviets on the march. Lawmakers believed economic concentration would make America more vulnerable. At the end of the antitrust stacks is a table near the window. ""This is my command post,"" said Lina Khan. It's nothing, really. A few books are piled up haphazardly next to a bottle with water and another with tea. Ms. Khan was in Dallas quite a bit over the last year, refining an argument about monopoly power that takes aim at one of the most admired, secretive and feared companies of our era: Amazon. The retailer overwhelmingly dominates online commerce, employs more than half a million people and powers much of the internet itself through its cloud computing division. On Tuesday, it briefly became the second company to be worth a trillion dollars. If competitors tremble at Amazon's ambitions, consumers are mostly delighted by its speedy delivery and low prices. They stream its Oscar-winning movies and clamor for the company to build a second headquarters in their hometowns. Few of Amazon's customers, it is safe to say, spend much time thinking they need to be protected from it. But then, until recently, no one worried about Facebook, Google or Twitter either. Now politicians, the media, academics and regulators are kicking around ideas that would, metaphorically or literally, cut them down to size. Members of Congress grilled social media executives on Wednesday in yet another round of hearings on Capitol Hill. Not since the Department of Justice took on Microsoft in the mid-1990s has Big Tech been scrutinized like this. Amazon has more revenue than Facebook, Google and Twitter put together, but it has largely escaped sustained examination. That is beginning to change, and one significant reason is Ms. Khan. In early 2017, when she was an unknown law student, Ms. Khan published ""Amazon's Antitrust Paradox"" in the Yale Law Journal. Her argument went against a consensus in antitrust circles that dates back to the 1970s — the moment when regulation was redefined to focus on consumer welfare, which is to say price. Since Amazon is renowned for its cut-rate deals, it would seem safe from federal intervention. Ms. Khan disagreed. Over 93 heavily footnoted pages, she presented the case that the company should not get a pass on anticompetitive behavior just because it makes customers happy. Once-robust monopoly laws have been marginalized, Ms. Khan wrote, and consequently Amazon is amassing structural power that lets it exert increasing control over many parts of the economy. Amazon has so much data on so many customers, it is so willing to forgo profits, it is so aggressive and has so many advantages from its shipping and warehouse infrastructure that it exerts an influence much broader than its market share. It resembles the all-powerful railroads of the Progressive Era, Ms. Khan wrote: ""The thousands of retailers and independent businesses that must ride Amazon's rails to reach market are increasingly dependent on their biggest competitor."" The paper got 146,255 hits, a runaway best-seller in the world of legal treatises. That popularity has rocked the antitrust establishment, and is making an unlikely celebrity of Ms. Khan in the corridors of Washington. She has her own critics now: Several leading scholars have found fault with Ms. Khan's proposals to revive and expand antitrust, and some have tried to dismiss her paper with the mocking label ""Hipster Antitrust."" Unwilling or perhaps unable to accept that a woman wrote a breakthrough legal text, they keep talking about bearded dudes. Ms. Khan was born in London to Pakistani parents who emigrated to the United States when she was 11. She is now 29, an Amazon critic whose Amazon account is largely inactive, newly married to a Texas doctor who uses his Amazon Prime account all the time. Ms. Khan was supposed to move this summer to Los Angeles, where she had a clerkship with Stephen Reinhardt, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals judge and liberal icon, but he suddenly died in March. Instead, Ms. Khan is set to start a fellowship at Columbia this fall, and is considering other projects as well. There is no shortage of parties that want her advice on how to reckon with Big Tech. ""As consumers, as users, we love these tech companies,"" she said. ""But as citizens, as workers, and as entrepreneurs, we recognize that their power is troubling. We need a new framework, a new vocabulary for how to assess and address their dominance."" At the S.M.U. library in Dallas, Ms. Khan was finding that vocabulary. These dead books, many from an era that predated the price-based era of monopoly law, were an influence and an inspiration. She was planning to expand her essay into a book, she said in an interview here in June. Then her life shifted, and she abruptly went from an outsider proposing reform to an insider formulating policy. Rohit Chopra, a new Democratic commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission, pulled her in as a temporary adviser in July, at a time when urgent questions about privacy, data, competition and antitrust were suddenly in the air. The F.T.C. is holding a series of hearings this fall, the first of their type since 1995, on whether a changing economy requires changing enforcement attitudes. The hearings will begin on Sept. 13 at Georgetown University Law Center. Two panels will debate whether antitrust should keep its narrow focus or, as Ms. Khan urges, expand its range. ""Ideas and assumptions that it was heretical to question are now openly being contested,"" she said. ""We're finally beginning to examine how antitrust laws, which were rooted in deep suspicion of concentrated private power, now often promote it."" Genuinely original voices are rare in Washington policy circles, and Mr. Chopra is pleased to have Ms. Khan in his camp. ""It's rare to come across a legal prodigy like Lina Khan,"" he said. ""Nothing about her career is typical. You don't see many law students publish groundbreaking legal research, or research that had such a deep impact so quickly."" Ida Tarbell, the journalist whose investigation of Standard Oil helped bring about its breakup, wrote this about John D. Rockefeller in 1905: ""It takes time to crush men who are pursuing legitimate trade. But one of Mr. Rockefeller's most impressive characteristics is patience. … He was like a general who, besieging a city surrounded by fortified hills, views from a balloon the whole great field, and sees how, this point taken, that must fall; this hill reached, that fort is commanded. And nothing was too small: the corner grocery in Browntown, the humble refining still on Oil Creek, the shortest private pipeline. Nothing, for little things grow."" When Ms. Khan read that, she thought: Jeff Bezos. Her Yale Law Journal paper argued that monopoly regulators who focus on consumer prices are thinking too short-term. In Ms. Khan's view, a company like Amazon — one that sells things, competes against others selling things, and owns the platform where the deals are done — has an inherent advantage that undermines fair competition. ""The long-term interests of consumers include product quality, variety and innovation — factors best promoted through both a robust competitive process and open markets,"" she wrote. The issue Ms. Khan's article really brought to the fore is this: Do we trust Amazon, or any large company, to create our future? In think tanks and universities, the battle has been joined. ""It's one thing to say that antitrust enforcement has gotten far too weak,"" said Daniel Crane, a University of Michigan scholar who doesn't agree with Ms. Khan but credits her with opening up a much-needed debate. ""It's a bridge much further to say we should go back to the populist goal of leveling playing fields and checking 'bigness.' "" As Mr. Crane writes in a forthcoming law review article: ""Antitrust law stands at its most fluid and negotiable moment in a generation."" The resistance is fierce and prominent. Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, wrote that if companies like Amazon are targeted simply because their low prices hurt competitors, we might ""quickly drive the economy back into the Stone Age, imposing hysterical costs on everyone."" Timothy Muris, a former chairman of the F.T.C., and Jonathan Nuechterlein, a former F.T.C. general counsel, published a paper in June that was a response to Ms. Khan and the antitrust reform movement. Called ""Antitrust in the Internet Era,"" it was about the A.&P. grocery chain. A.&P. essentially invented the modern supermarket in the 1920s. With its low prices, wide range of products and penchant for disruption, the chain became the leading retailer of its era. It owned 70 factories and eliminated middlemen, which allowed it to keep costs down. Yet, Mr. Muris and Mr. Nuechterlein wrote, ""A.&P.'s very popularity triggered a backlash."" The government pursued A.&P. on antitrust grounds during the 1940s, egged on by competitors that could not compete. After decades of decline, A.&P. shut its doors for good in 2015. The analogies with Amazon are explicit. Don't let the government pursue Amazon the way it pursued A.&P., Mr. Muris and Mr. Nuechterlein warned. ""Amazon has added hundreds of billions of dollars of value to the U.S. economy,"" they wrote. ""It is a brilliant innovator"" whose ""breakthroughs have in turn helped launch new waves of innovation across retail and technology sectors, to the great benefit of consumers."" Amazon itself could not have made the argument any better. Which isn't surprising, because in a footnote on the first page, the authors noted: ""We approached Amazon Inc. for funding to tell the story"" of A.&P., ""and we gratefully acknowledge its support."" They added at the end of footnote 85: ""The authors have advised Amazon on a variety of antitrust issues."" Amazon declined to say how much its support came to in dollars. It also declined to comment on Ms. Khan or her paper directly, but issued a statement. ""We operate in a diverse range of businesses, from retail and entertainment to consumer electronics and technology services, and we have intense and well-established competition in each of these areas,"" the company said. ""Retail is our largest business today and we represent less than 1 percent of global retail."" The first time Ms. Khan held power to account involved a Starbucks in suburban New York that was banning students from sitting down. Ms. Khan decided to write an article about the policy; Starbucks wouldn't answer her questions, but she managed to interview the employees. The New York Times picked up on the tempest, leaning on her reporting. Ms. Khan was 15, a correspondent for her high school newspaper. Her father was a management consultant; her mother an executive in information services. Ms. Khan went to Williams College, where she wrote a thesis on the political philosopher Hannah Arendt. She was the editor of the student paper but worked hard at everything. ""We were routinely emailing each other on separate floors of the library as it was closing at 2 a.m.,"" said Amanda Korman, a classmate. Like many a wonkish youth, Ms. Khan headed to Washington after graduating in 2010, applying for a position at the left-leaning New America Foundation. Barry Lynn, who headed the organization's Open Markets antimonopoly initiative, seized on her application. ""It's so much easier to teach public policy to people who already know how to write than teach writing to public policy experts,"" said Mr. Lynn, a former journalist. Ms. Khan wrote about industry consolidation and monopolistic practices for Washington publications that specialize in policy, went to Yale Law School, published her Amazon paper and then came back to Washington last year, just as interest was starting to swell in her work. In the summer of 2017, Open Markets was ejected from New America amid messy accusations that it displeased Google, a prominent funder, after the company was rebuked by European regulators for anticompetitive behavior. The think tank is now independent. ""Polls show huge concerns about concentrated power, corporate power, but if people are asked, 'Do we have a monopoly problem?' they answer, 'I don't know,' "" said Mr. Lynn. ""They don't have the language for it."" Amazon's $14 billion purchase of Whole Foods in the summer of 2017 — a startling move into physical retail — was almost a watershed, but not quite. Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law, called for hearings but did not get them. ""The whole country has been struggling to understand why the economy is not operating in the right way,"" Mr. Cicilline said. ""Wages have remained stagnant. Workers have less and less power. All we're trying to do is create a level playing field, and that's harder when you have megacompanies that make it virtually impossible for small competitors."" He added, ""We're at the very beginning of solutions to this."" Somewhere in the midst of all this, Ms. Khan found the time to marry Shah Ali, a doctor now doing a cardiology fellowship in Dallas, which explains why she was camping out at the S.M.U. law library. The honeymoon was in Hawaii. Dr. Ali took Jane Austen's ""Persuasion,"" because he hadn't reread it in a while. Ms. Khan brought a book on corporations and American democracy. The battle for intellectual supremacy takes place less these days in learned journals and more on social media, where tongues are sharp and branding is all. This is not Ms. Khan's strong suit. She is always polite, even on Twitter. One consequence is that she didn't give much thought about what to call the movement to reboot antitrust. Neither did anyone else. That presented an opening for the reformers' critics, who have tried with a limited degree of success to popularize the term ""Hipster Antitrust."" Konstantin Medvedovsky, an antitrust lawyer in New York, came up with the label last summer in a tweet that was responding to a tweet that was responding to a tweet by Ms. Khan. ""Antitrust Hipsterism,"" he wrote. ""Everything old is cool again."" Mr. Medvedovsky, who calls Ms. Khan's article ""the face of this movement,"" said the term was designed to be ""playful rather than pejorative."" Admirers of Ms. Khan and her fellow reformers have sometimes called them the New Brandeis School or the New Brandeisians, after Louis Brandeis, the Progressive Era foe of big business. As brands go, these are somewhat less catchy than ""Hipster Antitrust."" The April issue of the journal Antitrust Chronicle, edited by Mr. Medvedovsky, features a drawing of a bearded man on the cover right above the words ""Hipster Antitrust."" In the middle of an article by Philip Marsden, a professor of competition law and economics at the College of Europe in Bruges, there's a photograph of a bearded man taking a selfie next to the chapter heading ""Battle of the Beards."" It is perhaps relevant that only one of the 12 authors or experts in the issue is female. The Hipster issue was sponsored by Facebook, another sign that Big Tech is striving to shape the monopoly-law debate. The company declined to comment. Things are moving fast, so there is a lot to write papers about. Mr. Chopra, with Ms. Khan's assistance, pushed the argument further on Sept. 6 with a 14-page official comment that suggested the F.T.C. bring back a tool buried in its toolbox: the ability to make rules. Contemporary antitrust regulation, the commissioner wrote, is conducted in the courts, which makes it numbingly slow and dependent on high-paid expert witnesses. He called for the agency to use its authority to issue rules that would ""advance clarity and certainty"" about what is, and what is not, an unfair method of competition. These rules would not be ""some inflexible prescription"" but standards, guidelines, pointers or presumptions, he wrote. Since everyone affected by a proposed rule would have the opportunity to weigh in on it, the process would be more democratic. There is more than an echo here of Ms. Khan's notion that the past can help rescue the future. ""These are new technologies and new business models,"" Ms. Khan said. ""The remedy is new thinking that is informed by traditional principles."" Big Tech's great strength is that it is everywhere. Hardly anyone can live without it. But that omnipresence can be a weakness too. Just ask Facebook. It was the only global social media network, an enviable position — until it wasn't. Ideas for regulating Facebook that were once unimaginable are now on the table. Ms. Khan was not the first to criticize Amazon, and she said the company was not really her target anyway. ""Amazon is not the problem — the state of the law is the problem, and Amazon depicts that in an elegant way,"" she said. From Amazon's point of view, however, it is a problem indeed that Ms. Khan concludes in the Yale paper that regulating parts of the company like a utility ""could make sense."" She also said it ""could make sense"" to treat Amazon's e-commerce operation like a bridge, highway, port, power grid or telephone network — all of which are required to allow access to their infrastructure on a nondiscriminatory basis. Ms. Khan put those ideas out there, which is how Rachel Tsuna found them. Last fall, the Barnard College senior was casting about for a subject for her senior thesis. ""What is really interesting to you?"" her adviser asked. Ms. Tsuna, now 22, had worked for a chewing gum start-up — yes, there are such things — that sold through Amazon, and knew firsthand the retailer's tight grip. ""Amazon is scary!"" she exclaimed. This impulsive declaration suggested a topic: Did the F.T.C. have the grounds to move against Amazon? Ms. Tsuna made little progress until she came across Ms. Khan's paper. ""I finally felt like I was pursuing something valid,"" Ms. Tsuna said. ""Lina Khan gave me the confidence I needed."" The thesis, which is quite fair to Amazon, got an A minus. That's the way movements begin. Little things grow. ""This is a moment in time that invites a movement,"" said Ms. Khan. ""It's bigger than antitrust, bigger than Big Tech. It's about whether the laws serve democratic ends."" It was late at night in late July, and she was eating a burrata concoction at a popular restaurant near the Washington apartment she uses when not in Texas with her husband. After the death of Judge Reinhardt, her options opened up. She had the Columbia fellowship. Maybe she would also write the book. Or go back to the F.T.C. full time. Or somehow do it all. ""Amazon is a monopoly, and I worry that it monopolizes Lina,"" said her husband, Dr. Ali. ""I learn about what she is doing from looking at her Twitter feed."" ""I throw myself into things,"" Ms. Khan agreed. ""My life is spread out now."" With some cajoling, she revealed her Amazon account. There were just three purchases in 18 months. An altimeter for her father, who has taken up hiking, is the only one she will agree to have mentioned, although the other two are incredibly benign. One attribute Ms. Khan shares with Amazon is a strong desire to control the flow of information. Somewhat to her surprise, she is becoming a public figure. Before beginning her stint at the F.T.C., she said the news of her working there might be no more than a sentence or two at news sites that cover policy intensively. Instead it was a full-fledged story. The Information, a tech news site, declared: ""Amazon Antitrust Push Slowly Gains Ground."" Politico just named her one of the Politico 50, its annual list of the people driving the ideas driving politics. Balancing the attention and the achievement, the expectations and the demands, is difficult, perhaps impossible. ""I don't think of my work in grandiose terms. I feel an urgency but I'm also wary of hubris,"" Ms. Khan said. ""Nobody has been expecting this to succeed. I'm awed by the challenge."""
0,2018-09-12," One year, after 14 straight annual fishing trips, June (Maya Rudolph) and Oscar (Fred Armisen) decide to change up their routine and go skiing. Neither of them has ever skied before. They are middle-aged. It is perhaps too late for all this. They find themselves, freezing and unsteady, tottering on a bunny hill. ""Forever,"" whose eight bittersweet, loopily funny episodes arrive Friday on Amazon Prime, goes through a lot of narrative slaloms from there. But you can understand most of its consistent themes from this early scene. At heart, it's a comedy about love, stasis and change — whether you can transform your life after you've decided that your life is all it's ever going to be, and what happens after you push yourself downhill, or get pushed. The series sets its tone, and the terms of June and Oscar's marriage, in a jazz-scored opening montage. Vignettes pass from right to left: they meet, they fall in love, they move in together, they brush their teeth, they go fishing, they go fishing, they go fishing. It's a picture of a sweet, dull life, and the visual effect is of panning from room to room, unable to move backward and change direction. The pair have a bantering, best-pals rapport, passing time on a long drive by debating the best way to spend a half-hour. (Sex comes well down the list, after getting a massage and looking at your phone, and they both agree that thirty minutes is ""a little long."") Materially comfortable and unencumbered by children, they have the life rhythms of a prematurely retired couple, though they both work. The hitch, as the opening suggests, is that June is ready for something different and Oscar is not. Things do change, and this is where I must get vague. If you've heard anything about ""Forever,"" you've probably heard nothing. That is, you've heard that it takes some sharp turns and goes places you didn't expect to follow it to, and that it would be unsporting for a reviewer to say much more. That's all true, and thus I'll zip it about most of what happens beyond the first episode. You will think you have figured out what kind of show ""Forever"" is, and you will be wrong, and you will figure it out again, and you will be wrong again. (The show is best binged quickly; if it's not for you, you'll probably know three episodes in.) But in another sense, ""Forever"" is the same story from beginning to end. It's a narratively nimble show that's thematically about routine, emotional fidelity and the possibility, or impossibility, of reinvention. ""Forever"" was created by Alan Yang and Matt Hubbard, and at times it's like ""Master of None,"" the Netflix relationship comedy that Mr. Yang created with Aziz Ansari, but from the other side of commitment. It keeps turning over in its hand the weird idea of monogamy, wondering how people can manage being with one person indefinitely, and how they can manage not being so. Ms. Rudolph, a comedic typhoon who's shown dramatic nuance when given the chance (like in the 2009 film ""Away We Go"") carries the series' tone shifts remarkably. You expect her to pull off the big, broad stuff — feuding with a tween-age ski brat, belting a song at a party — but there are terrific silent moments that are simply June seeing her reflection, trying to decide if she's real. Mr. Armisen is right about half the time as Oscar, a variation on the neurotic, young-old-man character that he played in half his ""Portlandia"" roles. Maybe because of that history, and his tendency to push his characters to an unsettling, staring-too-long grotesqueness, his character lacks the gravity he needs in the more serious moments. If ""Forever"" were a movie — which it easily could have been — you'd say it has third-act problems. The story seems to spiral away from it in the last couple of episodes, and the ending feels like it's giving itself credit for resolving issues it hasn't fully addressed. But ""Forever"" dares enough, and pulls off a high enough percentage of what it tries, that I found it worth the trip. It manages to be at the same time slice-of-life and cosmically absurd, reflective and irreverent, fantastical and grounded. One of the best episodes shifts focus entirely, to a different couple who have a conversation that is not about June and Oscar but neatly describes their dilemma. One of them questions the concept of monogamy: ""Things change, people change and then you want something different."" The other counters, ""If you're with someone you love, you've got to fight for it."" A typical romantic comedy would leave no doubt that the second answer is the right one. ""Forever"" is willing to give both a hearing — and to understand that most people, who can live their lives only forward, will never know if a different answer would have been better for them. It's a tricky combination of tones ""Forever"" is aiming for, simultaneously heartfelt and ambivalent. But if the show sometimes gets out over its skis, I give it credit for being willing to strap them on."
0,2018-09-13," The Amazon founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, and his wife, MacKenzie, pledged $2 billion on Thursday for a new fund to start preschools and help homeless families. The money, put into what he called the Day 1 Fund, is by far the largest philanthropic donation by Mr. Bezos, the world's richest person. It will support organizations that provide shelter and food for homeless families, and will start a network of nonprofit Montessori-inspired preschools for underserved communities. ""If our own great-grandchildren don't have lives better than ours, something has gone very wrong,"" Mr. Bezos wrote on Twitter announcing the fund. As Mr. Bezos's wealth and influence has grown, he has faced increased public pressure to make significant philanthropic investments. His net worth is valued at $164 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He bought The Washington Post in 2013 for $250 million, and has said he's put about $1 billion a year into his private spaceflight company, Blue Origin. His largest known philanthropic contribution to date was $33 million in scholarships to support the education of undocumented students who graduated from high school in the United States. Earlier this month, he made his first major political contribution, putting $10 million into a bipartisan political action committee to support military veterans running for Congress. Other tech founders have come to see philanthropy as a major part of their legacy. Bill Gates, a founder of Microsoft, committed ""the vast majority"" of his assets to the foundation he started with his wife, Melinda. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla, said they would give 99 percent of their Facebook shares, valued at around $45 billion at the time of their 2015 announcement, to philanthropic work. Other tech leaders, including Paul Allen of Microsoft, Larry Ellison of Oracle and Brian Chesky of Airbnb, have signed the Giving Pledge, vowing to give away at least half of their wealth either during their lifetime or in their will. Mr. Bezos said the new education effort would build and run a national nonprofit network of free Montessori-inspired preschools. ""I'm excited about that because it will give us the opportunity to learn, invent, and improve,"" he wrote. ""We'll use the same set of principles that have driven Amazon. Most important among those will be genuine, intense customer obsession. The child will be the customer."" Mr. Bezos went to Montessori schools and has said it developed his sense of exploration and focus. The fund's homeless work will involve ""annual leadership awards"" to groups doing ""compassionate, needle-moving work to provide shelter and hunger support to address the immediate needs of young families,"" Mr. Bezos said. He cited Mary's Place, a nonprofit in the Seattle area that Amazon has worked with in recent years, as inspiration. Amazon has donated temporary space to Mary's Place and is building a shelter for 50 families with children that have life-threatening illnesses into a headquarters tower under construction. ""We have 600 shelter beds tonight, and they are full every night, all year long,"" said Marty Hartman, the executive director of Mary's Place. ""For Jeff and MacKenzie to embrace that no child should sleep outside and take it across the country is an incredible vision."" She declined to say if the Bezoses have personally toured Mary's Place and met with homeless families it serves but said they have ""had verbal communication"" and are kept up-to-date on Amazon's work with the organization. Earlier this year, Amazon publicly opposed a new per-employee business tax in its hometown of Seattle that would have raised about $50 million a year for homeless services and affordable housing construction. The city council repealed the tax under pressure from Amazon, other business and some homeowners. Last summer, Mr. Bezos went on Twitter to ask the public for suggestions for how he should give away some of his wealth, and tens of thousands of people replied. He said he was interested in using philanthropy to solve problems of the ""here and now."""

1,2018-09-20," SEATTLE — If you're one of the millions of people without a smart speaker in your home, Amazon wants to talk to you. On Thursday, the company announced not one, not six, but more than a dozen devices for its Alexa voice assistant — all meant to solve problems in your life that you may not have even known you had. There's even a microwave. ""If you have ever tried to defrost peas, it's a number of clicks,"" said Dave Limp, Amazon's senior vice president for devices and services. Mr. Limp said the $59.99 microwave, made by AmazonBasics, the company's house brand, was a way for Amazon to try out the smart home tools it is building out. The company wants the devices to be easier to set up out of the box and for other companies that make kitchen appliances — from rice makers to ovens — to tap into the Alexa platform. ""When we imagine a future with thousands of devices like this, this is going to become essential,"" Mr. Limp said. The microwave was perhaps the cheekiest in a blizzard of announcements at the event inside Amazon's headquarters. ""We took advantage of the hands-free moments,"" Tom Taylor, senior vice president of Alexa, said in an interview. ""How do we continue to expand? Where else are those opportunities?"" So far, Amazon's answer appears to be ""everywhere."" The company has a long history of introducing products and services at a rapid clip, in sharp contrast to competitors like Apple, which focuses on a few very refined releases at a time. Some of Amazon's ideas work, like its Kindle e-reader, and the company keeps building on them. But many of them fail, like its Fire smartphone, and the company quickly drops them. On Thursday, Mr. Limp also introduced an Echo Auto that plugs into cars; Fire TV Recast, a DVR recording device that lets users record live TV and watch on a variety of devices; and an analog wall clock with a voice-controlled timer. Another suite of devices announced on Thursday is aimed to appeal to audiophiles. Echo devices can now be used for individual left and right channels, meaning a pair can create stereo sound. And the new Echo Sub provides rich bass sounds, which Mr. Limp showed by booming Lorde's ""Royals."" The new Echo Input is the first Echo device without a speaker so users can connect their speakers to the brain of the Alexa. Since it introduced its Alexa smart assistant four years ago, the company has not shied from trying out new forms and uses. First it had an Echo speaker, a tall cylinder, then an Echo Dot, a version the size of a hockey puck. Then it added a screen, too, with the Echo Show. At the same time, developers wrote thousands of apps — or skills — for the devices. There are now more than 50,000 skills. The strategy helped Amazon quickly take the lead in the voice-controlled device market — a market it practically created. But it now has some stiff competition. A device from Google, the Home Mini, is now the top-selling smart speaker worldwide, Strategy Analytics, a research firm, wrote in a report this week. Google offers fewer types of devices, but has an advantage because millions of customers already have access to its voice assistant through the smartphones that use its Android operating system. Apple has also introduced its own high-priced voice-controlled speaker, focused on pristine audio quality, which Amazon looks to now be challenging head-on. ""The earlier days were more inventing on behalf of customers,"" said Mr. Taylor. ""Now we have a chance to invent by listening to customers."" The announcements Thursday show Amazon trying to flood the field, not just with its own devices but with products intended to model a way for outside manufacturers to build off Alexa's interface. ""It's overwhelming — that's the risk for the consumer,"" said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Creative Strategies. ""They have been so early in the market that they need to make sure the geeks that jump into the smart home early have something, but at the same time, they need to make it really simple for people who haven't yet."" Not all of the announcements were products. Amazon introduced new ways Alexa will try to anticipate the needs of users, not just respond to questions. The Alexa Hunches function, which will be public later this year, tries to provide suggestions; for instance, if a user says good night to Alexa, the voice assistant might note that a porch light is on and offer to turn it off. And users can turn on Alexa Guard when they leave their home, and the device will notify them if it detects a smoke alarm alert or the sound of a burglar smashing a window. Amazon also said users would no longer need to sign up individual skills to use them. Instead, they will be able to speak to Alexa, which will automatically pick the best skill. ""That was a big barrier, you learning how to talk to Alexa versus Alexa learning how you speak, which is how it should be,"" Ms. Milanesi said."

0,2018-09-22," What do you call it when employers use Facebook's advertising platform to show certain job ads only to men or just to people between the ages of 25 and 36? How about when Google collects the whereabouts of its users — even after they deliberately turn off location history? Or when AT&T shares its mobile customers' locations with data brokers? American policymakers often refer to such issues using a default umbrella term: privacy. That at least is the framework for a Senate Commerce Committee hearing scheduled for this Wednesday titled ""Examining Safeguards for Consumer Data Privacy."" After a spate of recent data-mining scandals — including Russian-sponsored ads on Facebook aimed at influencing African-Americans not to vote — some members of Congress are now rallying behind the idea of a new federal consumer privacy law. At this week's hearing, legislators plan to ask executives from Amazon, AT&T, Google, Twitter and other companies about their privacy policies. Senators also want the companies to explain ""what Congress can do to promote clear privacy expectations without hurting innovation,"" according to the hearing notice. There's just one flaw with this setup. In a surveillance economy where companies track, analyze and capitalize on our clicks, the issue at hand isn't privacy. The problem is unfettered data exploitation and its potential deleterious consequences — among them, unequal consumer treatment, financial fraud, identity theft, manipulative marketing and discrimination. In other words, asking companies whose business models revolve around exploiting data-based consumer-influence techniques to explain their privacy policies seems about as useful as asking sharks to hold forth on veganism. ""Congress should not be examining privacy policies,"" Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a prominent digital rights nonprofit, told me last week. ""They should be examining business practices. They should be examining how these firms collect and use the personal data of customers, of internet users."" The Senate Commerce hearing, however, doesn't seem designed to investigate commercial surveillance and influence practices that might merit government oversight. For one thing, only industry executives are currently set to testify. And most of them are lawyers and policy experts, not engineers versed in the mechanics of data-mining algorithms. Companies are sending their ""policy and law folks to Washington to make the government go away — not the engineering folks who actually understand these systems in depth and can talk through alternatives,"" Jonathan Mayer, an assistant professor of computer science and public affairs at Princeton University, told me. That may be because Congress is under industry pressure. California recently passed a new privacy law that would give Californians some power over the data companies' hold on them. Industry groups hope to defang that statute by pushing Congress to pass federal privacy legislation that would overrule state laws. The industry-stacked Senate hearing lineup seems designed to pave the way for that, said Danielle Citron, a law professor at the University of Maryland. Frederick Hill, a spokesman for the Senate Commerce Committee, said the group planned future hearings that would include other voices, such as consumer groups. But ""for the first hearing,"" Mr. Hill said, ""the committee is bringing in companies most consumers recognize to make the discussion about privacy more relatable."" What is at stake here isn't privacy, the right not to be observed. It's how companies can use our data to invisibly shunt us in directions that may benefit them more than us. Many consumers know that digital services and ad tech companies track and analyze their activities. And they accept, or are at least resigned to, data-mining in exchange for conveniences like customized newsfeeds and ads. But revelations about Russian election interference and Cambridge Analytica, the voter-profiling company that obtained information on millions of Facebook users, have made it clear that data-driven influence campaigns can scale quickly and cause societal harm. And that leads to a larger question: Do we want a future in which companies can freely parse the photos we posted last year, or the location data from the fitness apps we used last week, to infer whether we are stressed or depressed or financially strapped or emotionally vulnerable — and take advantage of that? ""Say I sound sick when I am talking to Alexa, maybe they would show me medicine as a suggestion on Amazon,"" said Franziska Roesner, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Washington, using a hypothetical example of Amazon's voice assistant. ""What happens when the inferences are wrong?"" (Amazon said it does not use Alexa data for product recommendations or marketing.) It's tough to answer those questions right now when there are often gulfs between the innocuous ways companies explain their data practices to consumers and the details they divulge about their targeting techniques to advertisers. AT&T's privacy policy  says the mobile phone and cable TV provider may use third-party data to categorize subscribers, without using their real names, into interest segments and show them ads accordingly. That sounds reasonable enough. Here's what it means in practice: AT&T can find out which subscribers have indigestion — or at least which ones bought over-the-counter drugs to treat it. In a case study for advertisers, AT&T describes segmenting DirecTV subscribers who bought antacids and then targeting them with ads for the medication. The firm was also able to track those subscribers' spending. Households who saw the antacid ads spent 725 percent more on the drugs than a national audience. Michael Balmoris, a spokesman for AT&T, said the company's privacy policy was ""transparent and precise, and describes in plain language how we use information and the choices we give customers."" But consumer advocates hope senators will press AT&T, Amazon and other companies this week to provide more details on their consumer-profiling practices. ""We want an inside look on the analytics and how they're categorizing, ranking, rating and scoring us,"" Professor Citron said. Given the increased public scrutiny, some companies are tweaking their tactics. AT&T recently said it would stop sharing users' location details with data brokers. Facebook said it had stopped allowing advertisers to use sensitive categories, like race or religion, to exclude people from seeing ads. Google created a feature for users to download masses of their data, including a list of all the sites Google has tracked them on. Government officials in Europe are not waiting for companies to police themselves. In May, the European Union introduced a tough new data protection law that curbs some data-mining.  It requires companies to obtain explicit permission from European users before collecting personal details on sensitive subjects like their religion, health or sex life. It gives European users the right to see all of the information companies hold about them — including any algorithmic scores or inferences.  European users also have the right not to be subject to completely automated decisions that could significantly affect them, such as credit algorithms that use a person's data to decide whether a bank should grant him or her a loan. Of course, privacy still matters. But Congress now has an opportunity to press companies like Amazon on broader public issues. It could require them to disclose exactly how they use data extracted from consumers. And it could force companies to give consumers some rights over that data."

0,2018-09-26," Amazon announced Tuesday that the veteran sports broadcasters Hannah Storm and Andrea Kremer would provide commentary this season on the company's ""Thursday Night Football"" stream. Storm and Kremer will be the first all-woman booth to call any major men's team sport, not just football. ""Thursday Night Football"" will be shown on traditional television on Fox, where Joe Buck and Troy Aikman will call the games. Amazon Prime subscribers will be able to stream the Fox telecast, as well as three alternative commentary options: Storm and Kremer, a Spanish-language stream and a U.K.-English stream. Kremer is a correspondent for the N.F.L. Network and HBO's ""Real Sports"" and previously worked for ESPN and as the sideline reporter for NBC's ""Sunday Night Football."" Storm hosts ""SportsCenter"" as well as anchors ESPN's coverage of numerous major sports events. She also owns a company that produces sports documentaries. They are following in the footsteps of Gayle Sierens, who called one N.F.L. game in 1987, and Beth Mowins, who has called a ""Monday Night Football"" game each of the past two seasons. Before their debut on Thursday night, Storm and Kremer talked about their style, their historic accomplishment, the kind words they received from Charles Barkley, and what comes next. This interview has been edited and condensed. The release didn't say, so who is doing play-by-play? Storm: If you had to, you would say that I was doing play-by-play and Andrea is doing analysis, but I don't think that you should be thinking of this in typical terms of the way that a broadcast is done. We are a different option. This is a game from our perspective. We are going to do a lot of storytelling. We do not have charge of the video. You are going to see us talking about things that might not necessarily match the picture on the screen. There's going to be a lot of conversations. We will have guests at times. Kremer: We have watched a lot of football over the years, and I think there is a certain language of football that exists, and whether it's A Gap penetration, cover-1, cover-2, cover-3, rub route, RPOs. Whatever it is, I think that this language of football exists, and you know, that's not our language. Will we be explaining things? Will we be analyzing things from our perspective? Absolutely. Storm: We are going to try to do what we do well, which is reporting, which is storytelling, which is putting things in perspective, and we are going to do it off of a world feed, off of Fox's feed. We are not at the game, so if you are expecting to turn it on and see some of what you've been used to seeing, that's not what is going to be happening. Kremer: But you will be able to follow the game. We are not losing sight of the fact that there is a game. What are you most excited about?  Storm: I am really excited in the big picture, at having young women, men, all sorts of people, to understand that football and sports is for everyone. That your perspective is valued. That this isn't something that only one segment of the population can understand and talk about. I am excited about continuing to follow in the footsteps of Jessica Mendoza and Beth Mowins and Doris Burke, and to show young women in particular, here is another career option for you. If you want to be a play-by-play person, if you want to be an analyst, don't be intimated. Why hasn't this opportunity presented itself for either of you two before, or for other women?  Kremer: I can't worry about what has been done in the past. I don't know why. One of the first people I heard from yesterday was Fred Gaudelli, the longtime executive producer of Sunday Night Football. He was one of the first people I heard from, and I was a little nervous because Freddie is the best, and he is a traditionalist. But he said to me: ""I had this idea four years ago and I couldn't get traction on it, and I am so happy. You are the perfect pair."" Storm: There is always the sort of bias that, oh, you have to have played the game to talk about it. Which is silly. We all know how silly that logic is whether it applies to sports or music or news or cooking, my goodness. If you are smart, if you do your homework, if you care, and then you have decades of experience, those are the things that matter. One person that I got a kick out of that we both heard from was Charles Barkley. When you go back to the '90s, I was broadcasting the N.B.A. on NBC. At the time, the Rockets were in a playoff run, and Charles Barkley was on the team. I said something that got back to him in the locker room, and he made the comment that: ""Well, women shouldn't be talking about basketball. Women shouldn't be talking about this."" In reference to me. A couple of weeks later, the Rockets were eliminated and we were at the N.B.A. finals in Chicago, and Charles was my halftime guest. On national television at halftime — and you know how big the audiences were back then — he apologized. He and I went on to be not only great friends but have a great deal of respect for each other. We have seen — just in general in sports — a lot more diverse voices in recent years, and that is because there have been some very important societal issues that have touched the sports world, and we needed diverse voices, we needed different perspectives. Even if you look at the sports landscape today compared to very recently, it's much more diverse because we have, thankfully, come to understand that a lot of perspectives are important. Do you feel like right now you are part of any sort of larger movement or some moment in time we are in? Kremer: Football in some ways has always been viewed as the last bastion for male domination in sports, so I think in some ways it is kind of ironic that it is the first ever all-female booth, covering the N.F.L. In terms of the societal impact, I think that may be for other people, but the really important thing is, it's not like Amazon set out to, ""Wow, let's put women in because the Me Too movement is going on."" It's not what the intent was. The intent was, look at it from a business perspective. They spent $50 million to stream. Why would you have streaming rights to a tremendous Fox broadcast and then try to do the same thing? You don't want to do the same thing. Is calling live games still the pinnacle of sports broadcasting?  Storm: Storytelling is great — there are so many muscles that you can stretch — but really when all is said and done, it is all about the live event. Therein lies the thrill, therein lies the challenge of not knowing what is going to happen and have a completely blank slate, if you will. I would say that, in that sense, it is the pinnacle, because that's what sports is: It is live, and you don't know. It is unscripted, so let's go. When will this cease being a big deal?  Storm: It is impossible to project. Obviously this is a streaming service that has different abilities and priorities than what we think of as traditional television, and are not beholden to ratings. They are broadcasting to 200 countries in the world and they are all about serving their subscribers and offering options. Honestly, this is trending in the right direction, but you know, it has been slow. I think in some ways things have changed — it feels like rapidly — and at the same time it feels like slowly. Kremer: There is one other thing I want to add quickly: We have a lead producer and a content producer, and both of them are women. Is it almost a great coincidence that they're women? Yes. But they are people that we know and trust. We may have a small team, but we have a team behind us."

0,2018-10-02," SEATTLE — Amazon said on Tuesday that it would raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour for its United States employees, a rare acknowledgment that it was feeling squeezed by political pressure and a tight labor market. The raises apply for part-time workers and those hired through temporary agencies. The company said it would also lobby Washington to raise the federal minimum wage, which has been set at $7.25 for almost a decade. The new wages will apply to more than 250,000 Amazon employees, including those at the grocery chain Whole Foods, as well as the more than 100,000 seasonal employees it plans to hire for the holiday season. The change will not apply to contract workers. It goes into effect on Nov. 1. ""We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead,"" Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, said in a statement. ""We're excited about this change and encourage our competitors and other large employers to join us."" Employment has become one of Amazon's most potent political vulnerabilities as well as its most important political message. The shift to online shopping, led by Amazon, has forced many retailers like Toys ""R"" Us and Sears to shut down or lay off workers across the country. President Trump has criticized the company for hurting traditional retailers, and some lawmakers have called for the company to be broken up. At the same time, jobs at Amazon's warehouses and sorting centers have boomed. The company now employs about 575,000 people worldwide, up more than 50 percent in the past year, a fact Amazon frequently plays up. But the pay of those workers has become a growing issue for activists, especially as the fortunes of Amazon and Mr. Bezos have skyrocketed. Amazon's market capitalization passed $1 trillion last month, though it has since fallen slightly below that level. Mr. Bezos is now the richest person in the world, with a net worth of $165 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. ""I think they saw the writing on the wall. I think they saw the calculation that it was indefensible that a man whose wealth is over $150 billion be able to continue paying workers wages that are so low that they are forced to rely on federal benefits,"" Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said in an interview after the announcement. ""Smart people are willing to change course."" Mr. Sanders and labor organizers have criticized the wages and conditions of Amazon's work force. They have focused on employees at the company's warehouses, and with the contract drivers who make last-mile deliveries. Some workers at the grocery chain Whole Foods, which Amazon bought last year, have recently begun a push to organize a union. Amazon had been paying a starting minimum wage of $11 an hour, and said its average wage for full-time workers at the fulfillment centers where it packages and sorts orders was more than $15 an hour. It had not disclosed pay for part-time and contract workers. Amazon said workers who now make more than $15 an hour will also get a pay bump, though it won't say how much. As recently as last month Amazon was resisting the pressure. Mr. Sanders had pointed to new financial disclosures from the company showing its median pay was $28,446, meaning half of its employees made less. Amazon, which is typically reserved when responding to criticism, publicly pushed back, saying Mr. Sanders's statements were ""misleading"" and that median pay for its full-time employees in the United States was $34,123. Mr. Sanders said he was particularly surprised to see Mr. Bezos raising pay to $15 almost immediately, rather than phasing it in over several years. ""That is bold, no question about it,"" he said. Mr. Bezos thanked Mr. Sanders on Twitter for praising the change. ""We're excited about this, and also hope others will join in,"" Mr. Bezos wrote. The union-backed Fight for $15 campaign, which has been calling for a higher minimum wage for six years, called Amazon's plan a major victory. It is organizing strikes in several states this week to build support for unions in advance of the midterm elections. Fight for $15 says more than a fifth of the population in the United States now lives in a state or city that has passed a $15 wage target, including California and New York, two major markets for Amazon. Increasingly, the company is putting operations close to and inside city borders to enable quick delivery. ""Workers worldwide have been standing up, joining together, and winning!"" the organization said in a message on Twitter. ""Amazon is just the latest company to respond."" Amazon has added robots at its warehouses and has expanded experiments like Amazon Go, its cashierless convenience stores that require few employees. But it still has a huge need for workers, particularly as the holiday season approaches. With the United States unemployment rate below 4 percent, the tight labor market has made it harder to attract the workers it and other retailers need. The smaller supply of prospective workers has slowly been pushing wages higher. The average wage for retail sales workers across the United States is $13.20 an hour, according to federal data. For all retail workers, including salespeople, cashiers and supervisors, the average wage is $18.85. Last year Target announced it would raise minimum pay to $15 an hour by 2020, and Costco  raised its to $14 an hour. In January, Walmart, the country's largest private employer, said it was raising starting wages to $11 after the new tax law passed, though critics noted that it was laying off workers as it tried to quietly close 63 Sam's Club stores. ""At the moment in the United States, unemployment is pretty low, and Amazon may be struggling to recruit and retain employees,"" said Alan Manning, an economics professor at the London School of Economics who has studied minimum wage policies. ""It's also a bit of good publicity."" Indeed, less than an hour after the announcement on Tuesday, Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president in charge of operations, posted a video on Twitter of employees at a fulfillment center in Southern California cheering as he broke the news to them. Amazon also announced minimum pay increases to £10.50 in London and £9.50 elsewhere in Britain. It said the minimum pay would benefit 17,000 Amazon employees and more than 20,000 seasonal workers in the country. The wage increase comes as the company plans to announce the location of its second headquarters before the end of this year. The new site, which Amazon says will eventually employ up to 50,000 highly paid technology workers, is widely expected to get what could be billions of dollars in tax breaks and other incentives from state and local governments. The size of the potential taxpayer payout, and the secrecy around the bidding process, have frustrated even some lawmakers in cities hoping to land the headquarters. With the company's promise to help lobby for a higher minimum wage, it attached itself to a progressive cause. Almost all of the 20 regions on Amazon's shortlist are run by Democrats, so the increase may buy the company some local good will. It also lets Amazon, which accounts for almost half of all online sales in the United States, ratchet up pressure on other retailers. ""Once you're paying a higher wage, you tend to want your competitors to also pay a higher wage,"" said Professor Manning. ""If your costs are going up, you'd also quite like your rivals' costs to go up as well."" Amazon provided almost no details in its announcement about how it plans to push for a higher federal minimum wage, and a representative at the company declined to elaborate. But the business has, in recent years, built one of the largest lobbying teams in Washington, spending $13 million last year. Given the political divide in the current Congress, Mr. Sanders said it still seemed unlikely that higher wages would pass. Instead, Mr. Sanders said, it's more likely to become a campaign issue, as well as put pressure on other large employers. Mr. Bezos's ""decision today is going to have a ripple effect to other corporations and other cities and states,"" he said. And unions say Amazon is not off the hook either. Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which is in the early stages of working with employees at Whole Foods, said in a statement that the wage increase was a ""positive step."" But he said it did not address other conditions, like giving more workers full-time positions and alleviating the production pressure some employees feel. ""There is still so very much more that Amazon needs to do to be considered a decent employer,"" he said."

2,2018-10-03," Los Angeles — Before writing an episode of his new Amazon series ""The Romanoffs,"" Matthew Weiner would ring a small bell. The trinket was a Christmas gift from one of the writers on the show, and the sound it made was essential for ""clearing the air,"" Mr. Weiner said. ""It was a moment of faith in intuition and the process."" Mr. Weiner's last series, the Emmy-winning AMC drama ""Mad Men,"" also concluded with the soft trill of a bell: There, it rang on a Northern California cliff top as the ad executive Don Draper (Jon Hamm) sat cross-legged among a group of meditating hippies. Don had come west in an attempt to divest himself of his job, but as the bell rang on that hill, a smile spread on the man's face. Without even meaning to, he had come up with a new idea. Inspiration did not arrive quite so easily for Mr. Weiner after ""Mad Men"" went off the air in May 2015. Recently, in a Hollywood editing bay, Mr. Weiner described a long rough patch where he felt unable to think of a new idea. After finishing a novel called ""Heather, the Totality,"" he found himself turned on by the notion of closed-end stories, and resolved that his next television project would not be serialized. Instead, he would make an episodic anthology where the characters, and sometimes even the genre, were different week to week. The result is ""The Romanoffs,"" which debuts Oct. 12 with two nearly 90-minute episodes. (In a break from the trend toward binge-watching, the next six installments will arrive every week thereafter.) The episodes, which Mr. Weiner also directed, take place all over the world yet have one unlikely thing in common: In each story, there are characters who believe themselves to be descendants of the Russian royal family whose reign came to a bloody end a century ago. But ""The Romanoffs"" is not the only notable thing that happened to Mr. Weiner this past year: A sexual harassment allegation was made against him last November by Kater Gordon, his former assistant and a writer on ""Mad Men."" In an interview with The Information, Ms. Gordon said that while writing the second-season finale of ""Mad Men,"" for which they would both win an Emmy, Mr. Weiner intimated that she owed him the chance to see her naked. ""That was not an isolated incident, but it was the most affecting,"" Ms. Gordon elaborated in a recent Vanity Fair article. Mr. Weiner, who is married with four children, rebuts the claim. But he acknowledges that he was not a perfect boss. ""I'm sad that I might have caused people anguish in the job, or made people unhappy,"" he said. ""Might have? I did."" These are edited excerpts from the conversation. When did you know you wanted to make another television show? I didn't for a while. I really didn't. I got a lot of advice from people who said I should stop working for a while after ""Mad Men"" and soak it in, and I was kind of into the time off. You have to reacquaint yourself with your family. I started watching TV in a noncompetitive atmosphere, and really stopped writing anything down, even notes, because ""Mad Men"" stories were still coming to me for a while after that. Even after the show was off the air? And it's like, what am I going to do with that? I wanted to try the discipline of not thinking that way. What if I were to experience things without the purpose of trying to turn it into a story? Then I tried to turn it back on again after six or eight months, and it was really bad. Nothing was happening. Then I went to Yaddo [an artists' retreat] and started my novel. Everything was activated by the novel. There was something about telling a story that was not continuing. You had a story people wanted to continue. People were clamoring for a ""Mad Men"" spinoff about Sally Draper. That was very flattering, actually. I loved that. I'm curious what would happen to her, too, but I didn't want to do that. I liked leaving the show where it was. ""The Romanoffs"" is very different than ""Mad Men,"" and even different from other anthology shows on television now. No matter which ""Black Mirror"" episode you're watching, you know it will be about the perils of modern technology. I'm not sure ""The Romanoffs"" is as easy to sum up in a sentence. Not to quote Don Draper, but you want to be a needle in a haystack, you don't want to be a haystack. If I went in pitching, ""It's Don Draper, but it's a woman in a pharmaceutical company …"" I said that as a joke to someone I was pitching to, and he said, ""Sold!"" But I don't want to do that. You know, they didn't want ""Mad Men"" at first, either, so asking for another ""Mad Men"" is funny. But what is the one-sentence thing? I don't know. When it came to ""Mad Men,"" you challenged AMC on the episode length, the budget and the expense of the licensed songs. And now I watch ""The Romanoffs,"" and the episodes are feature-length, incredibly lavish and filled with famous, expensive songs. Did Amazon let you have carte blanche? It was a wildest-dreams scenario. I will say that I don't know what people think an episode of TV costs, but we're not in the realm of ""Westworld"" or ""Game of Thrones."" But I did say, ""These are the things I would like to do that I couldn't do on 'Mad Men.'"" And music was definitely part of it. Why an episodic anthology? I'm not a trailblazer or a disrupter. I'm just thinking in terms of the audience: Wouldn't it be nice to have something that was on once a week that you didn't have to catch up with and you could watch in any order? You made a list of rules before you convened your writers' room for ""The Romanoffs,"" and one of those rules says, ""Ideas (especially intellectual) have no place in entertainment."" The three episodes I've seen are concerned with wealth, race and sex, among other ideas. But I'm not trying to write about race, I'm trying to write about some people that I know who are racist. ""Someone who becomes political"" is a story, but ""politics"" is not. It's just about character. Do you have any regrets over the way ""Mad Men"" treated race? I felt it would be a fantasy, unless I did an entire parallel show, to show the lives of black people through that world. I regret that on some level. There were black ad agencies, you know? But those characters were not in each others' worlds. It was an extremely segregated society even in New York. I'm interested in fairness, if that makes sense, and representation. There are 16 people on the poster for ""The Romanoffs,"" and every one of them is white. The famous people are white, that's true. Most of these characters are really rich. This Romanov thing, it's not like there couldn't be Romanovs of different races. I don't know what to tell you. There is a lot of diversity in the cast; they're just not people that you know. You will know them, hopefully. The main characters in the first three episodes are all fairly wealthy. Does that persist through the whole show? No, there are some regular people in there. It depends on the episode — they're all different from each other. I don't think that on Episode 3, which is set backstage on a mini-series, it really matters at all. The first two episodes both feature a middle-aged man in an unhappy relationship who's tempted by an affair with a younger woman. I don't know if I would characterize the first one that way. Certainly, in the second episode, that is about a marriage. The scene where the wife gets into bed and turns off the light and he says, ""I guess we're going to bed now,"" so many people have told me, ""Were you in my house?"" Because that's a long-term relationship. For me, the temptation for both of those people is the wish that there was something more exciting in their lives. Whenever the husband in that episode fantasizes about another woman, the camera takes his perspective and ogles the woman from head to toe. Right, because he is projecting this onto her. She is exotic and objectified by him, but that's in his mind. They're at an impasse in their marriage, and it is 50/50 to me. His wife has half the story. But the camera never adopts the wife's perspective in the same way that the camera adopts his. I don't think she's as warped as he is, in terms of his fantasy. I don't think I'm using the camera to do anything other than make you laugh at how improbable it is. When you make an actor, male or female, look attractive and do their makeup and put them in a costume that's flattering, are you objectifying them? I don't know. What did you make of the Kater Gordon article once you read it? I have reasons I don't believe that I said it, if that makes sense, but I really don't remember saying it. I mean, Kater and I were in a room together nine hours a day for six months, six days a week, and I just don't remember having that attitude. I didn't feel that way about her. I was surprised that so many years later, I was being told about that. We worked together for a year, and it did not work out. Why didn't it work out? She had won an Emmy the season before she was let go. There's lots of reasons. That was a really hard year for the staff on the show, and it was a very difficult year for getting story. I had a lot of people with no experience, and they needed to get experience elsewhere because it was too much work. In the end, she was not asked back, which is how we do it in TV. I really remember she was supposed to come down [to the office] to have that conversation with me, and she knew what it was about. Who would want to come down for that? So it was done over the phone. We did have a conversation that I really regret, the way it went. It was a lot of questions and a lot of answers, and it was not polite, and I never did it that way again. What do you mean when you say it was not polite? To do it over the phone and end up in an argument. It was really mean: ""I don't want you to work here anymore, and these are the reasons."" It's something you should do in person. It was heated, and it was not what I wanted. I had not been the boss very long. I had watched a lot of people do it, and I think that I was very casual about my responsibility to have higher standards of language, of humor, of everything. Your colleague Marti Noxon, who worked on the show at that time as a consulting producer, has said that she believes Ms. Gordon's account. She also described you as ""devilishly clever and witty, but he is also, in the words of one of his colleagues, an emotional terrorist who will badger, seduce and even tantrum in an attempt to get his needs met.""  I was surprised to hear that she had this experience of working with me. She was very interested in how I worked, and she was very instructive to me on how to use the room, because I didn't want to go in the writers' room. I couldn't deal with the pressure all the time of going in there and not hearing what I needed to hear and having to come up with stuff on my own. I was a very demanding boss. Some of it is continuing a tradition of hazing, in a weird way. Had you been hazed in other writers' rooms? Oh yeah. Absolutely. I wanted to give people an easier ride than I had. Has there been any course correction in the way you behave? Honestly, the course correction happened during the show. I can say this because I've been on both sides of it, but there are very few other jobs — maybe being a model — where when you critique someone's work as a writer, you are crossing a boundary into the personal immediately. But I was a very demanding boss. The show's not going to happen if you don't do it, and someone has to make these decisions. Because of that, when scripts come in and they're not the way you want them, you get mad at people for not doing things the way you would have done it, and that is just wrong. But no one cried in my room.  Did you ever cry when you were a writer in someone else's room? Yes, I did. I felt that I had been treated way worse than I had ever treated anybody on my show. I've never shared people's first drafts. I never did anything that I felt was crossing the line. You get rewritten, and it's embarrassing, but in a comedy room, they put your script up on the screen and 12 people see what you wrote and rewrite it. I think the fact that I've retained 85 percent of my crew from the first season of ""Mad Men"" over eight years is because it wasn't a crappy place to work. It's hard for me to believe that it was that bad. I remember once that at a Q. and A. for your film ""Are You Here,"" you told an audience member that you cared more what strangers thought of you than the people who know you well.  Wow. You can write down that I'm smiling, because out there in the world right now are lots of writers, painters, performers who are smiling at the baldness of that statement. I don't feel that way anymore, I can tell you that. It feels germane to ""The Romanoffs,"" because many of these characters are preoccupied with how they come across to people who barely know them. Here's the most uncomfortable thing about that statement: What an ugly thing to admit, what a shallowness there is to that. Who I am and how I'm perceived is literally the same question of nature and nurture to me: It's what's on the inside and what's on the outside. I do care what strangers think, but who doesn't? And if you end up in the public, you realize, ""I can't care too much, because a lot of the strangers aren't out there to pat you on the back."""

5,2018-10-03," Los Angeles — Before writing an episode of his new Amazon series ""The Romanoffs,"" Matthew Weiner would ring a small bell. The trinket was a Christmas gift from one of the writers on the show, and the sound it made was essential for ""clearing the air,"" Mr. Weiner said. ""It was a moment of faith in intuition and the process."" Mr. Weiner's last series, the Emmy-winning AMC drama ""Mad Men,"" also concluded with the soft trill of a bell: There, it rang on a Northern California cliff top as the ad executive Don Draper (Jon Hamm) sat cross-legged among a group of meditating hippies. Don had come west in an attempt to divest himself of his job, but as the bell rang on that hill, a smile spread on the man's face. Without even meaning to, he had come up with a new idea. Inspiration did not arrive quite so easily for Mr. Weiner after ""Mad Men"" went off the air in May 2015. Recently, in a Hollywood editing bay, Mr. Weiner described a long rough patch where he felt unable to think of a new idea. After finishing a novel called ""Heather, the Totality,"" he found himself turned on by the notion of closed-end stories, and resolved that his next television project would not be serialized. Instead, he would make an episodic anthology where the characters, and sometimes even the genre, were different week to week. The result is ""The Romanoffs,"" which debuts Oct. 12 with two nearly 90-minute episodes. (In a break from the trend toward binge-watching, the next six installments will arrive every week thereafter.) The episodes, which Mr. Weiner also directed, take place all over the world yet have one unlikely thing in common: In each story, there are characters who believe themselves to be descendants of the Russian royal family whose reign came to a bloody end a century ago. But ""The Romanoffs"" is not the only notable thing that happened to Mr. Weiner this past year: A sexual harassment allegation was made against him last November by Kater Gordon, his former assistant and a writer on ""Mad Men."" In an interview with The Information, Ms. Gordon said that while writing the second-season finale of ""Mad Men,"" for which they would both win an Emmy, Mr. Weiner intimated that she owed him the chance to see her naked. ""That was not an isolated incident, but it was the most affecting,"" Ms. Gordon elaborated in a recent Vanity Fair article. Mr. Weiner, who is married with four children, rebuts the claim. But he acknowledges that he was not a perfect boss. ""I'm sad that I might have caused people anguish in the job, or made people unhappy,"" he said. ""Might have? I did."" These are edited excerpts from the conversation. When did you know you wanted to make another television show? I didn't for a while. I really didn't. I got a lot of advice from people who said I should stop working for a while after ""Mad Men"" and soak it in, and I was kind of into the time off. You have to reacquaint yourself with your family. I started watching TV in a noncompetitive atmosphere, and really stopped writing anything down, even notes, because ""Mad Men"" stories were still coming to me for a while after that. Even after the show was off the air? And it's like, what am I going to do with that? I wanted to try the discipline of not thinking that way. What if I were to experience things without the purpose of trying to turn it into a story? Then I tried to turn it back on again after six or eight months, and it was really bad. Nothing was happening. Then I went to Yaddo [an artists' retreat] and started my novel. Everything was activated by the novel. There was something about telling a story that was not continuing. You had a story people wanted to continue. People were clamoring for a ""Mad Men"" spinoff about Sally Draper. That was very flattering, actually. I loved that. I'm curious what would happen to her, too, but I didn't want to do that. I liked leaving the show where it was. ""The Romanoffs"" is very different than ""Mad Men,"" and even different from other anthology shows on television now. No matter which ""Black Mirror"" episode you're watching, you know it will be about the perils of modern technology. I'm not sure ""The Romanoffs"" is as easy to sum up in a sentence. Not to quote Don Draper, but you want to be a needle in a haystack, you don't want to be a haystack. If I went in pitching, ""It's Don Draper, but it's a woman in a pharmaceutical company …"" I said that as a joke to someone I was pitching to, and he said, ""Sold!"" But I don't want to do that. You know, they didn't want ""Mad Men"" at first, either, so asking for another ""Mad Men"" is funny. But what is the one-sentence thing? I don't know. When it came to ""Mad Men,"" you challenged AMC on the episode length, the budget and the expense of the licensed songs. And now I watch ""The Romanoffs,"" and the episodes are feature-length, incredibly lavish and filled with famous, expensive songs. Did Amazon let you have carte blanche? It was a wildest-dreams scenario. I will say that I don't know what people think an episode of TV costs, but we're not in the realm of ""Westworld"" or ""Game of Thrones."" But I did say, ""These are the things I would like to do that I couldn't do on 'Mad Men.'"" And music was definitely part of it. Why an episodic anthology? I'm not a trailblazer or a disrupter. I'm just thinking in terms of the audience: Wouldn't it be nice to have something that was on once a week that you didn't have to catch up with and you could watch in any order? You made a list of rules before you convened your writers' room for ""The Romanoffs,"" and one of those rules says, ""Ideas (especially intellectual) have no place in entertainment."" The three episodes I've seen are concerned with wealth, race and sex, among other ideas. But I'm not trying to write about race, I'm trying to write about some people that I know who are racist. ""Someone who becomes political"" is a story, but ""politics"" is not. It's just about character. Do you have any regrets over the way ""Mad Men"" treated race? I felt it would be a fantasy, unless I did an entire parallel show, to show the lives of black people through that world. I regret that on some level. There were black ad agencies, you know? But those characters were not in each others' worlds. It was an extremely segregated society even in New York. I'm interested in fairness, if that makes sense, and representation. There are 16 people on the poster for ""The Romanoffs,"" and every one of them is white. The famous people are white, that's true. Most of these characters are really rich.

0,2018-10-09," SEATTLE — Last week, Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president in charge of operations, stood on a ladder in a warehouse near Los Angeles and announced to employees that Amazon was raising pay for its vast blue-collar work force. As soon as he said ""new Amazon minimum wage of $15 an hour,"" Mr. Clark was drowned out by more than 10 seconds of cheers and high-fives. Mr. Clark posted a video of the meeting on Twitter, where it has since been viewed more than 400,000 times. Senator Bernie Sanders, who had repeatedly criticized Amazon for how it treated its workers, praised the raise and shared the clip, adding another half-a-million views. But in Amazon warehouses across the country, many longtime workers are fuming that — based on the information they have received so far — they may end up making thousands of dollars less a year. Yes, Amazon is increasing wages, which will benefit most employees. But it will no longer give out new stock grants and monthly bonuses. Some workers believe that means their total compensation will shrink. Whether Amazon finds a way to close that gap will be closely watched in Washington. On Thursday, Mr. Sanders, an independent from Vermont, sent a letter to Jay Carney, who runs Amazon's public policy, ""asking Amazon to confirm how the total compensation of employees who would have received stock options — those with the company for two or more years — will be affected as a result of the recent changes,"" according to a copy provided to The New York Times. Mr. Sanders, who was alerted to the issue by workers, has not yet received a response from Amazon, a spokesman for the senator said. The New York Times spoke to about a half-dozen workers around the country, from Texas to Kentucky, and viewed numerous employee discussions on Facebook. All of the workers shared their pay stubs, but few would allow their names to be used. Near Minneapolis, Katy Iber, who handles returned products at an Amazon warehouse, works the night shift. Her region has a tight local labor market, so she already makes more than $15 an hour. In an ""all hands"" meeting at the start of her shift on Thursday — her first day at work after the pay raise was announced — she learned Amazon was raising her base pay by $1 an hour. But it was also ending monthly attendance and productivity bonuses, known as the Variable Compensation Plan, or V.C.P. And she would no longer be granted valuable Amazon shares. The trade-off meant she'd be losing money, she said. It was as though the company were saying: ""'Thanks, we appreciate you going into the holidays. Here's less money,'"" Ms. Iber said. The Times reached Ms. Iber through the Awood Center, a nonprofit that is organizing East African workers in the region. Amazon maintained in a statement that the higher hourly wage ""more than compensates for the phaseout"" of the stock and incentive bonuses. A traditional pay raise, the company said, is ""more immediate and predictable."" Amazon said more than 250,000 employees and an additional 100,000 seasonal workers would benefit from the pay changes, and announced similar changes for workers in Britain. Deutsche Bank estimated that Amazon's pay increase ""represents less than 1 percent of its projected 2019 revenue."" For many workers, including those who work part time and were never eligible for stock and bonuses, the raises in base pay will certainly put more cash in their pockets. Amazon officials said that over the next week they would adjust the pay of some employees to make sure workers did not end up losing money with the changes. The difference between what some employees believe is their total compensation and what the company believes they are being paid also may come down to accounting rules. Amazon said that if employees in 2018 get stock that was granted to them two years ago, that legally counts as compensation this year. But some employees believe that was compensation for work done two years ago. The difference — whether because of miscommunication or incomplete information given to employees — has resonated in Amazon warehouses around the country, particularly with employees with a longer tenure at the company. The dispute is over two compensation programs that will end on Nov. 1. The first, the Variable Compensation Plan, is paid out each month. It offered up to a 4 percent bonus for attendance, and an additional 4 percent if a worker's building met certain production goals. Ms. Iber said someone in her warehouse wrote ""BRING BACK VCP!!!!"" on a whiteboard where employees are encouraged to communicate with management. In the three months around the holiday season, known as ""double down,"" the bonus doubles, meaning employees could earn as much as 16 percent on top of their regular wages. The second program gave employees shares in Amazon stock each year. They get to keep the shares if they're still working at the company after two years. Recently, employees have been getting two shares, worth about a combined $3,725 at the current market value. With the changes, workers get to keep the stock granted in previous years but will not earn new shares. Documentation that Ms. Iber provided showed that her bonus amounted to $1.28 an hour in August. In the three months around the holidays, that could be more than $2.50 an hour, far more than the $1-an-hour increase in base pay she's getting. She is down even more when stock grants are taken into account. She will keep old shares but will not be granted new ones. In a Facebook group popular with employees, workers fumed over the changes, according to screenshots from the page that were viewed by The Times. There were so many negative pending posts on the day Amazon announced the $15 wage that a moderator wrote that she had deleted them and pleaded with workers to write to the corporate offices in Seattle rather than vent online. Another poster wrote that her co-workers were contemplating a walkout on Black Friday, the big shopping day after Thanksgiving, and others said they were saddened to lose the sense of ownership that the stock compensation provided. Workers said the timing of the change, just as bonuses double for the holiday season, stings. Ms. Iber said a co-worker had told her that he regretted paying down some credit card debt in anticipation of the extra holiday bonus. He worried that without the extra holiday pay, he won't be able to cover his regular monthly bills. She could sympathize. Last year, Ms. Iber used the holiday season bonuses to pay for insulation in her attic. She was going to get a new water heater this year, but now she's holding off. She said that she would wait for the heater to break, and that when it did, she'd put the repairs on a credit card."
0,2018-10-10," Get ready for the streaming wars. AT&T announced on Wednesday that it plans to unveil a digital video service featuring WarnerMedia's films and television shows by the end of next year, moving it into direct competition with rivals like Netflix, Disney and Amazon. ""We are committed to launching a compelling and competitive product that will serve as a complement to our existing businesses and help us to expand our reach by offering a new choice for entertainment with the WarnerMedia collection of films, television series, libraries, documentaries and animation loved by consumers around the world,"" John Stankey, who oversees WarnerMedia, said in a statement. That means that blockbuster Warner movies like the Harry Potter franchise and ""Wonder Woman"" could show up on the service next to TV shows like ""Friends"" and HBO hits like ""Game of Thrones."" Mr. Stankey appeared on Wednesday at a conference hosted by Vanity Fair in Los Angeles but did not offer details about how much the service will cost, what its name will be or the date it will become available. AT&T, which acquired Time Warner in June for $85.4 billion, had already said a motivation for the deal was to enter the streaming market, currently dominated by Netflix. The merger gave AT&T a vast media and entertainment portfolio that includes HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network, the rights to major sports leagues and valuable film franchises. ""We're going to bring a fresh approach to how the media and entertainment industry works for consumers, content creators, distributors and advertisers,"" Randall L. Stephenson, AT&T's chairman and chief executive, said at the time. Streaming has become a crowded field as the once-robust TV business has suffered under a decline of cable and satellite customers. Netflix, a cheap alternative, has exploded in growth, and its model of both owning and distributing content has wowed Wall Street. Its stock has jumped more than 80 percent in the past year. WarnerMedia already licenses its films and shows to other streaming businesses, but it will have to forgo that revenue once it carries that content exclusively for its own service. ""Friends,"" for example, a WarnerMedia property, is licensed to Netflix in a deal that will run out in a few years. In an interview after his appearance, Mr. Stankey estimated that a quarter of the WarnerMedia library licensed to other streaming services comes up for renewal every year. WarnerMedia already has several streaming products. Its best known is HBO Now, which was introduced in 2015 and now has over five million customers. Last month, WarnerMedia started selling a video subscription service offering feature films and shows based on characters from DC Comics, another Warner property, that is being heavily marketed across studio lots in Hollywood. Mr. Stankey described the new service as a ""collection of boutiques,"" with HBO as its ""anchor tenant."" As part of the introduction, HBO will sharply ramp up its programming slate, Mr. Stankey said. But HBO itself will remain focused on high-end entertainment and not become a warehouse for all Warner content, as some had feared. ""We need hours a day,"" Mr. Stankey said at a town hall gathering with HBO employees this summer, referring to the time viewers spend watching HBO programs. ""It's not hours a week, and it's not hours a month. We need hours a day. You are competing with devices that sit in people's hands that capture their attention every 15 minutes."" Later in that meeting, he said HBO must ""build that brand so that it's broad enough to make that happen."" Now, it appears the streaming service would be more akin to a high-end mall, with HBO bringing in new customers. ""HBO is a really important brand, a really important property for us,"" he said at the conference. ""However, I don't think HBO as its own stand-alone brand will meet the needs of the broad scale of audience and customers that we want to address."" Though declining to say how much the coming service would cost, Mr. Stankey said that it would be more than HBO Now, which costs $15 a month. In addition to HBO and some Warner Bros. films, it will most likely include shows from its TV library. It will not include CNN. Notably, AT&T's service will coincide with a new offering from the Walt Disney Company, which also plans to start a streaming product next year. Disney beat out Comcast in a fierce bidding war for the majority of 21st Century Fox, pushing to win the streaming market by stocking up on valuable content. ""Disney doesn't have a paid premium service like we do with HBO,"" Mr. Stankey said. ""We're also AT&T. We already have tens of millions of direct consumer relationships."" Comparing AT&T's approach to Disney's, he added, ""What's important to understand is that ours is a unified offering — we're not expecting people to buy three different pieces."""
1,2018-10-10," More than 40 years ago, Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft with a vision for putting a personal computer on every desk. No one really believed them, so few tried to stop them. Then before anyone realized it, the deed was done: Just about everyone had a Windows machine, and governments were left scrambling to figure out how to put Microsoft's monopoly back in the bottle. This sort of thing happens again and again in the tech industry. Audacious founders set their sights on something hilariously out of reach — Mark Zuckerberg wants to connect everyone — and the very unlikeliness of their plans insulates them from scrutiny. By the time the rest of us catch up to their effects on society, it's often too late to do much about them. It is happening again now. In recent years, the tech industry's largest powers set their sights on a new target for digital conquest. They promised wild conveniences and unimaginable benefits to our health and happiness. There's just one catch, which often goes unstated: If their novelties take off without any intervention or supervision from the government, we could be inviting a nightmarish set of security and privacy vulnerabilities into the world. And guess what. No one is really doing much to stop it. The industry's new goal? Not a computer on every desk nor a connection between every person, but something grander: a computer inside everything, connecting everyone. Cars, door locks, contact lenses, clothes, toasters, refrigerators, industrial robots, fish tanks, sex toys, light bulbs, toothbrushes, motorcycle helmets — these and other everyday objects are all on the menu for getting ""smart."" Hundreds of small start-ups are taking part in this trend — known by the marketing catchphrase ""the internet of things"" — but like everything else in tech, the movement is led by giants, among them Amazon, Apple and Samsung. For instance, Amazon last month showed off a microwave powered by Alexa, its voice assistant. Amazon will sell the microwave for $60, but it is also selling the chip that gives the device its smarts to other manufacturers, making Alexa connectivity a just-add-water proposition for a wide variety of home appliances, like fans and toasters and coffee makers. And this week, both Facebook and Google unveiled their own home ""hub"" devices that let you watch videos and perform other digital tricks by voice. You might dismiss many of these innovations as pretty goofy and doomed to failure. But everything big in tech starts out looking silly, and statistics show the internet of things is growing quickly. It is wiser, then, to imagine the worst — that the digitization of just about everything is not just possible but likely, and that now is the time to be freaking out about the dangers. ""I'm not pessimistic generally, but it's really hard not to be,"" said Bruce Schneier, a security consultant who explores the threats posed by the internet of things in a new book, ""Click Here to Kill Everybody."" Mr. Schneier argues that the economic and technical incentives of the internet-of-things industry do not align with security and privacy for society generally. Putting a computer in everything turns the whole world into a computer security threat — and the hacks and bugs uncovered in just the last few weeks at Facebook and Google illustrate how difficult digital security is even for the biggest tech companies. In a roboticized world, hacks would not just affect your data but could endanger your property, your life and even national security. Mr. Schneier says only government intervention can save us from such emerging calamities. He calls for reimagining the regulatory regime surrounding digital security in the same way the federal government altered its national security apparatus after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Among other ideas, he outlines the need for a new federal agency, the National Cyber Office, which he imagines researching, advising and coordinating a response to threats posed by an everything-internet. ""I can think of no industry in the past 100 years that has improved its safety and security without being compelled to do so by government,"" he wrote. But he conceded that government intervention seems unlikely at best. ""In our government-can't-do-anything-ever society, I don't see any reining in of the corporate trends,"" he said. Those trends are now obvious. It used to be difficult to add internet connectivity to home devices, but in the last few years the cost and complexity of doing so have plummeted. Today, off-the-shelf minicomputers like the Arduino can be used to turn just about any household object ""smart."" Systems like the one Amazon is offering promise to accelerate the development of internet-of-things devices even further. At a press event last month, an Amazon engineer showed how easily a maker of household fans could create a ""smart"" fan using Amazon's chip, known as the Alexa Connect Kit. The kit, which Amazon is testing with some manufacturers, would simply be plugged into the fan's control unit during assembly. The manufacturer also has to write a few lines of code — in the example of the fan, the Amazon engineer needed just a half-page of code. And that's it. The fan's digital bits (including security and cloud storage) are all handled by Amazon. If you buy it from Amazon, the fan will automatically connect with your home network and start obeying commands issued to your Alexa. Just plug it in. This system illustrates Mr. Schneier's larger argument, which is that the cost of adding computers to objects will get so small that it will make sense for manufacturers to connect every type of device to the internet. Sometimes, smarts will lead to conveniences — you can yell at your microwave to reheat your lunch from across the room. Sometimes it will lead to revenue opportunities — Amazon's microwave will reorder popcorn for you when you're running low. Sometimes smarts are used for surveillance and marketing, like the crop of smart TVs that track what you watch for serving up ads. Even if the benefits are tiny, they create a certain market logic; at some point not long from now, devices that don't connect to the internet will be rarer than ones that do. The trouble, though, is that business models for these devices don't often allow for the kind of continuing security maintenance that we are used to with more traditional computing devices. Apple has an incentive to keep writing security updates to keep your iPhone secure; it does so because iPhones sell for a lot of money, and Apple's brand depends on keeping you safe from digital terrors. But manufacturers of low-margin home appliances have little such expertise, and less incentive. That's why the internet of things has so far been synonymous with terrible security — why the F.B.I. had to warn parents last year about the dangers of ""smart toys,"" and why Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, has identified smart devices as a growing threat to national security. An Amazon representative told me that the company was building security into the core of its smart technologies. The Connect Kit, the company said, lets Amazon maintain the digital security of a smart device — and Amazon is very likely to be better at security than many manufacturers of household appliances. As part of its cloud business, the company also offers a service for companies to audit the security of their internet-of-things services. The Internet of Things Consortium, an industry group that represents dozens of companies, did not respond to an inquiry. Mr. Schneier is painting government intervention not as a panacea but as a speed bump, a way for us humans to catch up to the technological advances. Regulation and government oversight slow down innovation — that's one reason techies don't like it. But when uncertain global dangers are involved, taking a minute isn't a terrible idea. Connecting everything could bring vast benefits to society. But the menace could be just as vast. Why not go slowly into the uncertain future?"
2,2018-10-10," To the Editor: Re ""Amazon Raises Minimum Pay to $15 an Hour"" (front page, Oct. 3): Amazon has announced a minimum-wage increase, and reports have already come in that warehouse workers' bonuses and stock benefits are being cut as the increase takes effect (""Amazon Lauded for Raises, but Workers Are at a Loss,"" Business Day, Oct. 10). Some workers fear that the loss of these benefits will result in lower pay. The public has probably already decided that Amazon is a benevolent corporation. But those of us who care about sustainable wages and working conditions in the United States should tread carefully and pay close attention to the confusion and dismay being voiced by Amazon employees. When a company's minimum wage is increased without legislation — and especially without a union contract — we must keep in mind that what has been given can always be taken away. Frank GattieAstoria, QueensThe writer is a member of the communications team at the National Employment Law Project.  To the Editor: To Amazon Workers: Hey, guys! Ever hear of the Wagner Act, known formally as the National Labor Relations Act of 1935? The right to organize and join a union? The right to collective bargaining? It might be a costly struggle if your philanthropist employer is also a dedicated union-buster, but it's your right and it's worth it. Susan DunnWilliamstown, Mass.The writer, a professor at Williams College, is the author of ""1940: F.D.R., Willkie, Lindbergh, Hitler."" To the Editor: Assuming, as Amazon says, that the recently announced increase in the minimum hourly wage for its workers will result in an increase in their overall pay, Amazon's decision is obviously a positive development, but it is also a function of supply and demand. The labor market is tight, Amazon is increasingly profitable, and the company needs to attract and retain more employees. This is the way the market is supposed to work. Amazon's announcement makes a mockery of the position taken by progressives who continually agitate for government-mandated minimum-wage levels that are above what the market will bear. That unavoidably leads to reduced levels of employment, hurting workers. David B. StaffordScarsdale, N.Y. To the Editor:  Amazon's move to raise the minimum wage for its employees in the United States and Britain is good news for many, but the company is still lagging behind competitors when it comes to preventing forced labor across its global supply chains. In a report released this summer by KnowTheChain, where I am the project director, Amazon ranked 20 out of 40 tech companies in its efforts to prevent forced labor in its supply chains — well behind the American tech giants Intel, HP and Apple.  Although Amazon wasn't the worst performer, it has a long way to go to protect workers across the globe who contribute to the company's monumental profits but are vulnerable to exploitation with little recourse for addressing forced labor. Amazon's next move should be to ensure that all workers in its supply chains are treated with dignity. Kilian MooteBrooklyn"
3,2018-10-10," Get ready for the streaming wars. AT&T announced on Wednesday that it plans to unveil a digital video service featuring WarnerMedia's films and television shows by the end of next year, moving it into direct competition with rivals like Netflix, Disney and Amazon. ""We are committed to launching a compelling and competitive product that will serve as a complement to our existing businesses and help us to expand our reach by offering a new choice for entertainment with the WarnerMedia collection of films, television series, libraries, documentaries and animation loved by consumers around the world,"" John Stankey, who oversees WarnerMedia, said in a statement. That means that blockbuster Warner movies like the Harry Potter franchise and ""Wonder Woman"" could show up on the service next to TV shows like ""Friends"" and HBO hits like ""Game of Thrones."" Mr. Stankey appeared on Wednesday at a conference hosted by Vanity Fair in Los Angeles but did not offer details about how much the service will cost, what its name will be or the date it will become available. AT&T, which acquired Time Warner in June for $85.4 billion, had already said a motivation for the deal was to enter the streaming market, currently dominated by Netflix. The merger gave AT&T a vast media and entertainment portfolio that includes HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network, the rights to major sports leagues and valuable film franchises. ""We're going to bring a fresh approach to how the media and entertainment industry works for consumers, content creators, distributors and advertisers,"" Randall L. Stephenson, AT&T's chairman and chief executive, said at the time. Streaming has become a crowded field as the once-robust TV business has suffered under a decline of cable and satellite customers. Netflix, a cheap alternative, has exploded in growth, and its model of both owning and distributing content has wowed Wall Street. Its stock has jumped more than 80 percent in the past year. WarnerMedia already licenses its films and shows to other streaming businesses, but it will have to forgo that revenue once it carries that content exclusively for its own service. ""Friends,"" for example, a WarnerMedia property, is licensed to Netflix in a deal that will run out in a few years. In an interview after his appearance, Mr. Stankey estimated that a quarter of the WarnerMedia library licensed to other streaming services comes up for renewal every year. WarnerMedia already has several streaming products. Its best known is HBO Now, which was introduced in 2015 and now has over five million customers. Last month, WarnerMedia started selling a video subscription service offering feature films and shows based on characters from DC Comics, another Warner property, that is being heavily marketed across studio lots in Hollywood. Mr. Stankey described the new service as a ""collection of boutiques,"" with HBO as its ""anchor tenant."" As part of the introduction, HBO will sharply ramp up its programming slate, Mr. Stankey said. But HBO itself will remain focused on high-end entertainment and not become a warehouse for all Warner content, as some had feared. ""We need hours a day,"" Mr. Stankey said at a town hall gathering with HBO employees this summer, referring to the time viewers spend watching HBO programs. ""It's not hours a week, and it's not hours a month. We need hours a day. You are competing with devices that sit in people's hands that capture their attention every 15 minutes."" Later in that meeting, he said HBO must ""build that brand so that it's broad enough to make that happen."" Now, it appears the streaming service would be more akin to a high-end mall, with HBO bringing in new customers. ""HBO is a really important brand, a really important property for us,"" he said at the conference. ""However, I don't think HBO as its own stand-alone brand will meet the needs of the broad scale of audience and customers that we want to address."" Though declining to say how much the coming service would cost, Mr. Stankey said that it would be more than HBO Now, which costs $15 a month. In addition to HBO and some Warner Bros. films, it will most likely include shows from its TV library. It will not include CNN. Notably, AT&T's service will coincide with a new offering from the Walt Disney Company, which also plans to start a streaming product next year. Disney beat out Comcast in a fierce bidding war for the majority of 21st Century Fox, pushing to win the streaming market by stocking up on valuable content. ""Disney doesn't have a paid premium service like we do with HBO,"" Mr. Stankey said. ""We're also AT&T. We already have tens of millions of direct consumer relationships."" Comparing AT&T's approach to Disney's, he added, ""What's important to understand is that ours is a unified offering — we're not expecting people to buy three different pieces."""
4,2018-10-10," More than 40 years ago, Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft with a vision for putting a personal computer on every desk. No one really believed them, so few tried to stop them. Then before anyone realized it, the deed was done: Just about everyone had a Windows machine, and governments were left scrambling to figure out how to put Microsoft's monopoly back in the bottle. This sort of thing happens again and again in the tech industry. Audacious founders set their sights on something hilariously out of reach — Mark Zuckerberg wants to connect everyone — and the very unlikeliness of their plans insulates them from scrutiny. By the time the rest of us catch up to their effects on society, it's often too late to do much about them. It is happening again now. In recent years, the tech industry's largest powers set their sights on a new target for digital conquest. They promised wild conveniences and unimaginable benefits to our health and happiness. There's just one catch, which often goes unstated: If their novelties take off without any intervention or supervision from the government, we could be inviting a nightmarish set of security and privacy vulnerabilities into the world. And guess what. No one is really doing much to stop it. The industry's new goal? Not a computer on every desk nor a connection between every person, but something grander: a computer inside everything, connecting everyone.

0,2018-10-11," As the creator of ""Mad Men,"" Matthew Weiner had a thing about spoilers. Each season arrived with a list of no-nos for critics, such as the number of floors in the advertising office where it was set. When he announced a series for Amazon Prime, I joked that maybe he'd make it a spoiler to say what the new show was about. I have to hand it to him with ""The Romanoffs,"" which begins Friday. I've seen three episodes, and I couldn't tell you what the series is if I wanted to. O.K., in broad terms I can. The episodes are stand-alone stories, with different stars and a thin tissue of connection: contemporary characters who are associated with or believe they are descended from the Russian royal family, whose members were executed by Bolsheviks in 1918. (Sorry, spoiler.) I can also say that ""The Romanoffs"" is TV only in the broadest sense. The episodes, around an hour and a half in length, are essentially movies. The first three installments are eclectic, sometimes beguiling and each, in a different way, ultimately frustrating. The series begins elegantly, in Paris, with ""The Violet Hour."" Anushka (Marthe Keller), a spiteful, elderly aristocrat, is attended by her American nephew, Greg (Aaron Eckhart), and his sullen French girlfriend, Sophie (Louise Bourgoin). She keeps them in line with the promise of inheriting a Fabergé egg and her grand apartment, once used by a Russian royal as a stash pad for his mistress. Greg's burden is lightened, then complicated, by Anushka's new caretaker, Hajar (Inès Melab), a Muslim woman who patiently wears down Anushka's sourness and racism. They develop an odd, culturally freighted relationship — the senescent past reconciling itself to Europe's future — until the last act blows up the script's character-building for the sake of a shock ending. ""The Royal We"" shifts its setting to American suburbia, and its tone to marital farce. Shelly (Kerry Bishé) finds herself vacationing alone when her mopey, dissatisfied husband, Michael (Corey Stoll), contrives an excuse to cancel. The catch: The vacation is a themed cruise for Romanov descendants. He is one, but she's not. Bishé is luminous but underserved by the long-suffering-wife role, and the episode finds Michael's tedious midlife crisis way more absorbing than it is. But the scenes on the cruise — full of elderly Americans cosplaying as early-20th-century Russian nobles — are transporting. (A talkative gentleman in the bar keeps smashing his vodka glasses with a flourish; ""Sir, you have to stop doing that,"" the put-upon bartender says.) There's a sense in both early episodes that the characters have been twisted and soured by family legends they're doomed to fall short of. ""Mad Men,"" too, was fascinated with the layers of history and the stub ends of the faded gentry. There's a little Pete Campbell in each of these modern-day nobles. In the third installment, ""House of Special Purpose,"" Olivia (Christina Hendricks), a high-profile actress, is on location in Austria shooting a Romanovs mini-series directed by the imperious Jacqueline (Isabelle Huppert). Huppert is astounding, her brusqueness gradually giving way to mania. The story — a showbiz sendup with Rod Serling-esque horror elements — gets increasingly over the top as it goes on. And on. The episodes feel stretched out, and while Amazon clearly invested in the series, which shot in seven countries, it's not scaled up visually to match. The episodes are movie-length but directed, by Weiner, like television. That said, I love the audacity of the idea, the playfulness of the dialogue, the unpredictability of the storytelling. While shooting the series-with-in-a-series of the third episode, Huppert's character says jadedly, ""This is exactly what television needs: another period piece with well-dressed mannequins."" ""The Romanoffs"" is not that. It's more like a ""Black Mirror"" of relationships, privilege and ruling classes in decline. All three screened episodes involve women navigating unequal power structures or dealing with men acting badly, as they often did in ""Mad Men."" It's striking since this is also Weiner's first series since he was accused, by the ""Mad Men"" writer Kater Gordon, of having told her while working that she owed it to him to let him see her naked. Weiner recently told Vanity Fair that he apologized ""if I have wronged somebody."" Gordon, in a post on Twitter, wrote: ""My memory is intact. Matthew's abuse of workplace power dynamics was rampant, and the comments he made should not be viewed as an isolated occurrence."" After ""Mad Men"" ended, Weiner expressed doubts about binge TV. ""Mad Men"" was like a ghost that appeared for three months of Sundays, leaving its witnesses to interpret its portents for a week. If he ever made a streaming series, he said, he'd want it to appear weekly, to preserve that experience. He's done that. The first two ""Romanoffs"" go live Friday, with the other six coming once a week. I might start with ""The Royal We,"" which is not necessarily the best of the three but has the best moments, which I am enjoined from describing by the lengthy spoiler list. (Some things never change.) Maybe the whole will add up to more. ""Mad Men"" seasons would often start at a slow roll, only to layer on meaning and incident and build to a breathtaking finish. Only time (if the pattern holds, about 12 hours) will tell. But ""The Romanoffs"" does not introduce itself as a Russian nesting doll, one unit fitting into another to form one ingenious artifact. It's a series of ornate but ponderous creations, a shelf-busting set of Fabergé ostrich eggs."
1,2018-10-11," Walmart is going Hollywood. The world's largest retailer, in a constant battle with its rival Amazon, said this week that it was teaming up with two entertainment companies, one old school and the other on the industry's cutting edge. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has agreed to create short-form original series for Walmart's ad-supported streaming service, Vudu. Those are expected to debut early next year. It is the first of many studios that Walmart expects to work with in creating new content for Vudu, a spokesman for the retailer said Wednesday. Walmart is also investing in a joint venture with Eko, a New York start-up that focuses on ""interactive storytelling,"" a video format that allows viewers to control the plot of commercials and television episodes. The investment with Eko totals $250 million, according to two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the deal. It is thought to be the largest bet on the interactive entertainment niche, which has long tantalized producers as a potential gold mine but has never gained widespread adoption. ""We are not trying to become a studio,"" said Scott McCall, a senior vice president for entertainment, toys and seasonal at Walmart. ""It is our hope that we will work with studios to reimagine what new content looks like."" Walmart, based in Bentonville, Ark., has been seeking to expand its business beyond brick-and-mortar retailing. With most of the nation saturated by its big-box stores, Walmart has been experimenting with a flurry of new ventures, including starting a high-end concierge service in Manhattan and acquiring India's leading e-commerce site, Flipkart. Now it's turning to content creation. Walmart's substantial investment is a validation for Eko, which was co-founded by the 37-year-old Yoni Bloch, who described himself in an interview in his New York office as ""a relatively famous singer in Israel."" He has also been a judge on the Israeli version of ""American Idol."" Walmart was introduced to Eko when the retailer's chief executive, Doug McMillon, met Mr. Bloch while visiting Israel last year. The two companies started working together on an interactive presentation that Eko prepared for Walmart's shareholder meeting — the annual corporate pep rally in Bentonville attended by thousands of workers. Walmart sees interactive storytelling — essentially a video version of ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" books — as something that can be used in both entertainment and advertising. There could be a cooking show, for instance, that helps viewers buy the ingredients online as they watch. Or a love story in which viewers can choose what happens to the characters. In turn, each choice could help Walmart glean insight into the viewers' preferences and attitudes. ""The idea is around leapfrogging what everyone else is doing,"" Mr. Bloch said. A cross between a video game and traditional television, interactive storytelling has been held back by technology hurdles and tricky funding. Making one great traditional ad or TV episode is expensive enough, much less one that branches off in different directions depending on what choices people make while viewing. Interactive content has also been hindered by a generational divide. Older consumers — and media executives — are accustomed to a passive viewing experience and have a hard time grasping this way of participating in storytelling. Younger viewers are the opposite. (Netflix already has a few interactive shows aimed at children.) Eko is far from alone in chasing the promise of interactive content, but it has a secret weapon: Nancy Tellem. Ms. Tellem, who is Eko's executive chairman (and also sits on the MGM board), gives Eko considerable credibility in Hollywood. She worked in senior jobs at CBS and Warner Bros. Television for roughly two decades before joining Microsoft in 2012 to create an Xbox-centered television business. Microsoft shut down her division in 2015. For Mr. Bloch, Walmart reminds him of youthful visits to the United States. ""Walmart was to me the symbol of America,"" he said. ""I just remember my mom said we have to go to Walmart because everything is big and cheap there."" He started his company in 2010 with his bandmates, many of whom had a background in computing. Eko has attracted investments from Silicon Valley firms like Sequoia Capital, as well as establishment backers like Warner Music and Intel. In addition to the $250 million investment in the joint venture, Walmart has invested an undisclosed amount in Eko directly. Many of the details about the joint venture are still being worked out — like where these shows or advertisements can be viewed. Walmart and Eko said they would share in any revenue. Walmart raised its visibility in Hollywood during this year's Academy Awards, when the company sponsored three short films, featuring the work of three female directors: Melissa McCarthy, Nancy Meyers and Dee Rees. The films, which were inspired by a Walmart e-commerce box, doubled as an advertisement for the retailer. The first project to come from the MGM partnership, which was announced at a conference on Wednesday in Los Angeles, will be a ""reimagining"" of the comedy ""Mr. Mom,"" which will debut on Vudu early next year. Mr. McCall said Vudu would work with MGM on revitalizing other classic movies and creating entirely new content."
0,2018-10-12," Matthew Weiner's new series debuts on Amazon. And Maggie Gyllenhaal stars in ""The Kindergarten Teacher"" on Netflix. THE ROMANOFFS on Amazon. Matthew Weiner had writer's block. After a seven-season run of ""Mad Men,"" the show he'd created, Weiner took a break and then tried to restart his creative brain. ""It was really bad,"" he told The New York Times in a recent interview. ""Nothing was happening."" Then he wrote his debut novel, ""Heather, the Totality,"" published in 2017, and discovered the pleasure of telling a story that didn't have to continue episode to episode. Another result of that realization comes in the form of ""The Romanoffs,"" an anthology series for Amazon with an all-star cast: Diane Lane, Kathryn Hahn, John Slattery, Aaron Eckhart and Isabelle Huppert are among the faces appearing across its eight episodes. In each, there are characters who think they descend from the titular Russian royal family. That bizarre connective tissue binds these stories, which are set around the world. The series begins with a pair of episodes, each nearly 90 minutes. THE KINDERGARTEN TEACHER (2018) on Netflix. ""I think we have a young Mozart."" That line, delivered by a kindergarten teacher (played by Maggie Gyllenhaal), would typically be welcome praise from an instructor. But there's a dark edge to it in this thriller. Directed by Sara Colangelo (""Little Accidents""), the movie is a remake of an Israeli film about a teacher who develops an obsession with a young student (played here by Parker Sevak). In her review for The Times, Jeannette Catsoulis called it a ""riveting remake,"" writing that Colangelo suffuses ""each scene with an insinuating, prickly tension"" and ""remains ruthlessly committed to her screw-tightening tone, offering the viewer no comforting moral escape hatch."" THE CURIOUS CREATIONS OF CHRISTINE McCONNELL on Netflix. Audiences resentful that streaming services lack goth baking shows are in luck this week. Ms. McConnell, the author of ""Deceptive Desserts: A Lady's Guide to Baking Bad!,"" plays a fictional version of herself in this cooking show, which also has spooky puppets. SHAKESPEARE UNCOVERED 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). Shakespeare's ""The Merchant of Venice"" has long provoked debate over its anti-Semitism, a theme so easily extracted that the play was used as propaganda in Nazi Germany. In this episode of PBS's Shakespeare history series, the actor F. Murray Abraham discusses and investigates the controversies surrounding the play. POD SAVE AMERICA 11 p.m. on HBO. Tommy Vietor, Jon Lovett, Jon Favreau and Dan Pfeiffer, former members of the Obama White House, have built the popularity of their podcast through sharp, funny political commentary; the show has been thought of as a liberal version of conservative talk radio. Before the midterm elections, they're bringing the podcast to TV for four one-hour specials, recorded in Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania and California."
0,2018-10-15," The orders poured in from everywhere — 105,000 a day at one point — so much so that the company became an economic force. It could make or break suppliers by promoting their products. It could dictate terms on manufacturing. Its headquarters city boomed as this tech-driven retailer built huge warehouses and factories and attracted other businesses and rivals. State and local governments complained that the company was harming small-town retailers. That was Sears, Roebuck & Company in the early 20th century in Chicago. But at various times in the history of retailing you could apply like descriptions of retail might to Walmart, Kmart, Safeway, A.&P., and F.W. Woolworth, whose Downtown Manhattan headquarters building was christened the ""Cathedral of Commerce"" when it opened in 1913. Today the Woolworth Building is a luxury condo whose young residents are probably unaware of the extraordinary entrepreneur who built it. Which is to say that becoming the nation's leading retailer does not guarantee immortality, at least not beyond architecture. Sears, once America's dominant retailer, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after 132 years in business. Sears became the Amazon of its day because its co-founder Richard Warren Sears harnessed two great networks to serve his enterprise — the railroads and the United States Postal Service. When the Postal Service commenced rural free delivery in 1896 (the ""last mile"" in today's jargon) every homestead in America became within reach. And Richard Sears reached them. He used his genius for advertising and promotion to put a catalog in the hands of 20 million Americans in 1900, when the population was 76 million. The Wish Book or Big Book or Dream Book, as the catalog was variously called, could run a staggering 1,500 pages and offer more than 100,000 items. And when one of his pants suppliers, the manufacturing wizard Julius Rosenwald, became his partner, in 1886, Sears was on the way to becoming a vertically integrated juggernaut. Whether you needed a cream separator or a catcher's mitt, a plow or a dress, or an entire house, Sears had it. ""No matter where you go or how long you look, you'll not find values approaching those this book presents,"" the spring 1922 catalog declared. Sears would carve up the catalog landscape with a local rival, Montgomery Ward. Remember it? Probably not. The e-sales promotion company Groupon, itself once mighty and now clinging to life, occupies part of Ward's former headquarters in Chicago. Sears, Montgomery Ward and another Midwestern-born general merchandise retailer, J.C. Penney, dominated postwar American retailing, controlling 43 percent of department store sales by 1975. But even by then, Sears was beginning to falter under waves of new competition. The company was not alone. A.&P., which introduced the first cut-rate grocery store in 1912, was also sliding into a long decline that would last through decades of ownership and management changes. Great A.&P. went through the final checkout lane in 2016 following its second bankruptcy. (Or was that the third?) A.&P. once operated 15,819 stores and ran the world's largest food packaging plant, in Horseheads, N.Y. The company was so powerful that in 1949 trustbusters tried to slice it into seven independent companies. Even before that, states passed ""chain laws"" that included minimum markups, so small stores couldn't be undermined by the loss leaders that A.&P. would offer to attract shoppers. A.&P., a vicious competitor, buried local retailers anyway. By the inflation-racked 1970s, though, A.&P. was struggling against nimbler chains such as Safeway, which became the country's top grocer, and Kroger, as well as new models of retailing such as big-box stores. Walmart's eventual move into groceries would help seal A.&P.'s fate, and, at the same time, make the Arkansas company the nation's top retailer, where it remains. For now. A.&P. would later show some dubious creativity when in the early 1980s management scrapped and replaced the ""overfunded"" pension plan, plundering it for operating capital. This piece of sliminess was copied all over corporate America, signaling the end of the pension plans that so many workers depended on for retirement income. In its earlier days, with strong leaders such as Robert E. Wood, Sears was able to negotiate huge shifts in the economic and demographic landscape. By 1925, more Americans were living in the cities than in rural areas. Sears followed them by opening retail stores. The postwar boom would give rise to the suburban shopping mall, and Sears could easily finance and grab what were then (but not necessarily now) the best locations across the country. By the mid-1980s, after a restructuring, the company briefly blossomed anew, in part by becoming a more full-blown conglomerate that owned Allstate Insurance and the Dean Witter brokerage. Sears also tried to crack the credit card market with its Discover card. The rationale was that Americans trusted Sears on the spending side of family finance, so why wouldn't they do the same on the savings side? The proposal was framed this way: ""Would you buy stocks where you buy socks?"" Answer: Not really. High up in the Sears Tower, management couldn't see that the retail landscape was changing. Sears couldn't compete effectively with Walmart and the growth of big box merchandisers such as Toys ""R"" Us. But more important, the company could not summon the vision to anticipate the internet. By 1993, Sears had closed its national network of warehouses and exited the catalog business — which is basically e-retailing without the ""e."" Amazon shipped its first book in 1995. Which brings us to Eddie Lampert, the chief executive of ESL Investments, who bought Sears in 2005 figuring, wrongly, that he could reinvigorate it. Mr. Lampert recently blamed Sears' retirees for some of the company's problems, complaining that paying them the money they were owed was holding the company back. He's spent a decade shrinking Sears (and Kmart, which is part of the parent company, Sears Holdings) and then blamed the economy, the weather, Walmart, Amazon and everything else when his plan foundered. Saddled with debt it can't afford, Sears is filing for Chapter 11 to keep itself afloat through the Christmas holidays. No one wants to buy into Mr. Lampert's latest restructuring plan, which would sell ESL control of some of Sears' best remaining assets, including the Kenmore appliance brand. Amazon, the world's leading e-tailer, is now one of the biggest clients of the . Postal Service. As Sears did in 1925, Amazon has moved into brick-and-mortar retail, buying Whole Foods and opening its own stores as it tries to close the store gap with Walmart. And the company has gone well beyond any retailer in terms of diversification, including web and cloud hosting, original content, fashion, hardware, even an airline fleet. Amazon certainly has the government's attention, or at least the president's, and its recent announcement of a minimum wage of $15 an hour for all United States employees will stave off some of the withering criticism about its employment practices. Amazon's goal is to be less disliked than Walmart, apparently. Certainly, Amazon looks unassailable in its current form. So did every retailer that became the biggest dog on retail's porch. They were all innovative. They all pushed the boundaries on pricing, sourcing, marketing, regulation, employment, expansion and tax breaks. They all ultimately lost their way. Sears is the latest chapter in that story. And probably not the last."
0,2018-10-17," Jair Bolsonaro, the strident far-right politician who triumphed in Brazil's presidential election on Sunday, will not only shape the destiny of Latin America's largest country. His election is also a referendum on the fate of the Amazon: the world's largest tropical forest, sometimes known as the lungs of the Earth. The stakes for the planet are huge. Mr. Bolsonaro — who once said that Brazil's environmental policy is ""suffocating the country"" and on Sunday triumphed in the national election — has promised to champion his country's powerful agribusiness sector, which seeks to open up more forest to produce the beef and soy that the world demands.  He has stepped back from an earlier suggestion to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, telling reporters last week that Brazil would remain in the deal. Even so, his campaign promises, if carried out, could have dire consequences for the Amazon, and therefore for the rest of the planet. Stretching across two million square miles, most of it in Brazil, the Amazon acts as a giant sink for the carbon dioxide emissions that the world as a whole produces.  Mr. Bolsonaro has said he would scrap the Environment Ministry, which is mandated to protect the environment, and instead fold it into the Agriculture Ministry, which tends to favor the interests of those who would convert forests into farmland.  He has dismissed the idea of setting aside forest land for native Brazilians who have lived in the Amazon for centuries, promising that ""there won't be a square centimeter demarcated as an indigenous reserve"" under his leadership.  Recent studies show that forest reserves controlled by native people in many countries provide some of the best defenses against deforestation. Mr. Bolsonaro sees other uses of the forest, though. ""Where there is indigenous land,"" he has said, ""there is wealth underneath it.""  And according to a Reuters report, his campaign has also suggested that Mr. Bolsonaro would reduce penalties against those who violate environmental laws. ""A potential Bolsonaro win would, without a doubt, make Brazil lose its leadership on the global climate agenda and become a huge obstacle for the global efforts to combat global warming,"" said Carlos Rittl, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a Brazilian organization that compiled the presidential candidates' positions on environmental issues.  Mr. Bolsonaro's opponent in the Sunday runoff, Fernando Haddad of the leftist Workers Party, promised aggressive targets to halt deforestation, though his party has in the past erected enormous infrastructure projects with devastating environmental consequences — the Belo Monte dam, for instance.  Forests all over the world are lucrative for commercial interests, and converting forestland to grow commodities like soy and beef accounted for about a fourth of all global deforestation between 2001 and 2015, according to a recent study. In the Amazon, deforestation has long been caused by illegal ranching, logging and the conversion of forests into farms. Global demand for beef, one of Brazil's top commodities, is growing. The United States-China trade feud has increased the demand for soy, Brazil's other top commodity, as well. Until recently, Brazil had been lauded as an environmental leader. It had pledged zero illegal deforestation by 2030 under the Paris agreement and sharp reductions in its carbon emissions as a whole. Deforestation rates began falling steadily starting around 2005. But that trend has since reversed, and, according to satellite surveys by Brazil's National Institute for Space Research, more than 3,000 square miles of forest cover were lost between August 2015 and July 2016. Indeed, long before Mr. Bolsonaro declared his bid to be president, Brazil had been retreating on its environmental policies. Politicians on left have been less vocal about claiming resources in indigenous lands, for example, but the demarcation of reserves slowed under former President Dilma Rousseff and deforestation rates began to rise.  A crippling recession also has also taken a toll, resulting in sharply reduced funding for the Environment Ministry.  An analysis by Brazilian scientists found that if current environmental trends continue in the country, Brazil would not meet its emissions reductions targets under the Paris Agreement. And Global Witness, in collaboration with The Guardian newspaper, found Brazil to be the deadliest place for environmental rights campaigners. Cutting down trees creates emissions, too. Lots of emissions. A report from a research and advocacy group called Global Forest Watch found that carbon dioxide emissions from tree-cover loss in tropical countries averaged 4.8 gigatons every year between 2015 and 2017, or equal to the emissions that come out of the tailpipes of 85 million cars over their entire lifetime. If that rate of tropical forest loss continues, the report said, it would be impossible for the world to keep global warming to below the goals of the Paris accord. Brazil is the world's sixth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, though its emissions are much smaller than the two big industrial countries of the world, China and the United States. Agriculture and oil production are the top sources of Brazil's emissions. The recent rollback of conservation measures reflects the growing influence of a powerful conservative wing within Brazil's legislature that calls itself the Beef, Bible and Bullet Coalition. A Bolsonaro victory would amplify its influence, analysts said. The next president of Brazil will face an immediate choice that stands to affect its global stature. Brazil, which hosted the Earth Summit in 1993, when world leaders first began to sign on to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, is in the running to host its annual negotiations in November 2019. Its goal is to rally countries to slow down global warming, including by saving forests. "
0,2018-10-18," SEATTLE — Amazon won't say a word about where it plans to put its much-hyped second headquarters. Officials in the 20 cities and regions named as finalists say that they don't know anything — and that even if they did, they wouldn't share it publicly. But that hasn't stopped investors, economic officials and developers from trying to reverse engineer the HQ2 search, to understand what a company seen as embodying the future wants and needs, and what local governments should do to be part of that future. The growing consensus is that the place that checks the most boxes is Northern Virginia. In online betting forums, it has the best odds of landing the project. Analysts at Citi recently said most investors they spoke with also expected HQ2 to end up in the Washington area, noting that Northern Virginia is home to Amazon's cloud computing division's ""largest and fastest-growing office outside of Seattle."" Many have gone a step further, suggesting that Crystal City, an older office area being revitalized just across the Potomac River from Washington, offers the best site. Its upsides: good transit, diverse residents, a friendly business climate and a single developer with a big chunk of land. ""There are a lot of merits to a lot of these places, but at the end of the day, all of the signs are pointing to Crystal City,"" said Amy Liu, director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. ""I'm just going to say it."" With few details from Amazon and the 20 finalist areas, experts have been left to study the economic and social fundamentals of a region and search for hints wherever they can find them. The potential prize is huge, with $5 billion in investment and up to 50,000 high-paying jobs, according to the company. Amazon says it will announce its decision by the end of the year. Other areas that are regularly named as strong contenders include Chicago, Atlanta and Austin, Tex. Washington and the Maryland suburbs are also finalists. Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and chief executive, already owns the biggest newspaper and the largest mansion in Washington, and his ties to the city have long been a reason that the region tops most lists predicting HQ2's result. It doesn't hurt, either, that choosing the area would put Amazon in the backyard of lawmakers just as talk about the company's labor practices and potential antitrust regulation is picking up. The interest in the area rose a few weeks ago when Mr. Bezos headlined an event at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C. More than 1,000 executives, ambassadors and politicians gathered in a ballroom and flocked around him, pressing in to take selfies and shake hands. When the formal program began, Mr. Bezos was soon asked the obvious: Where would he be opening HQ2? The crowd cheered and whistled at the question, posed with more than a hint that the headquarters should be right there in the region, then playfully booed as Mr. Bezos demurred. ""Be nice,"" Mr. Bezos, the world's richest person, pleaded with a laugh. Northern Virginia is widely considered to have a leg up on its neighbors for some practical reasons. Virginia is seen as more business-friendly, with low regulation and taxes, according to an annual ranking from Chief Executive magazine that's popular with site selectors. Maryland offered Amazon more than $5 billion in taxpayer incentives, but Virginia has not disclosed its package. Washington also has a 13-story limit on most buildings. And while Washington and Maryland are reliably Democratic, Virginia is more of a swing state, giving Amazon potential champions from both parties. ""If you had your headquarters in a city and were responsible for tens of thousands of jobs, you could be seen as a good corporate citizen,"" said Richard Florida, a professor at the University of Toronto who has followed Amazon's urban development for more than two decades. The headquarters search centers on Amazon's seemingly insatiable appetite to hire enough of the talent it needs. To do so, the company says, it needs to be somewhere with a strong talent pipeline and the urban attributes, like public transportation and culture, that attract other employees to move. ""People want to be where there is vibrancy at the street level,"" said Jodie McLean, chief executive of Edens, a developer who has worked around the region and is involved with Washington's bid. The region is home to one of the most educated work forces in the country. Amazon already has a growing presence, with more than 2,500 employees in corporate and technical roles, like lobbyists in Washington and engineers at data centers in the Virginia suburbs serving government contracts. Nearby Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport has strong domestic connections, while Dulles International Airport links up globally. And the Metro rail network is one of the busiest in the country. After Amazon announced the headquarters search, lawmakers in the region approved $500 million in annual maintenance spending for the interstate Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, which oversees the subways. Crystal City is about as close to Washington as possible while still being in Virginia. It's one Metro stop away from National Airport, and just a few stops across the Potomac River from Washington. ""It is a dense, up-and-coming, mixed-used area that has a lot of opportunity for more development,"" Ms. Liu said. Other locations in Northern Virginia fit many of Amazon's requirements. But they're more suburban, and being in the middle of Seattle has become a central part of Amazon's identity. One question that looms over Crystal City, and Northern Virginia more broadly, is whether it is hip enough for the employees Amazon wants to attract. Crystal City is a jumble of mostly outdated, low-slung offices built decades ago for defense contractors, and a smattering of retail outlets. That has left it with a high vacancy rate, around 20 percent, according to JLL, a commercial real estate brokerage. Much of the South Lake Union neighborhood in Seattle was also a civic no-man's-land, filled with auto body repair shops and parking lots, before Amazon moved there. Some leases in Amazon's buildings require restaurants to stay open on weekends and through dinner hours — what Amazon called an ""18-hour district"" — but nearby cafes are often quiet after the happy hour rush subsides. Crystal City offers another parallel to Amazon's Seattle headquarters: Much of the land is owned by a single developer, which makes it easier to plan and build in a quick and cohesive way. Until recently, Amazon relied heavily on the investment firm of the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who died Monday, to build its Seattle campus. JBG Smith, a publicly traded investment trust, owns large swaths of Crystal City, and its chief executive, Matt Kelly, spoke before Mr. Bezos at the Economic Club, fueling yet another round of speculation among HQ2 watchers. ""Everybody is talking about Crystal City,"" said Stephen S. Fuller, a leading regional economist at George Mason University. ""The fit is good."" JBG Smith isn't commenting on Amazon, though in recent months it has hired a public relations agency to respond to HQ2 queries. In its latest investor filing, it said, ""Our focus is to put our best foot forward, expect nothing and hope for the best."" JBG Smith has big plans for Crystal City and has already signed Alamo Drafthouse, the movie theater chain, to anchor a new retail district. It's working with the local government to convert a highway that bisects the area into a more pleasant, tree-lined boulevard. ""Some of the dreaming that is going on is just waiting for an accelerant, and that's what I think Amazon would be,"" Dr. Fuller said. Among some in the region's real estate crowd, it has become almost a joke that Mr. Bezos should buy JBG Smith outright. ""If you are an opportunist, it looks like this would be of interest,"" Dr. Fuller said. ""And clearly Amazon has been opportunistic in their whole history."" Amazon may not have the patience and trust that Northern Virginia can be transformed, especially when Washington already is so rich, right across the Potomac. ""The District has magnificent neighborhoods and magnificent urbanity,"" Professor Florida said. Like everyone who guesses where HQ2 may land, he added a big caveat. ""I'm not in Jeff Bezos' mind,"" he said."

The yearly marvel never ceases to amaze us, so we wanted to share an explanation we first published a couple of years ago The leaves of deciduous trees change colors as nights lengthen and cooler weather prevails, according to the U.S. Forest Service. The structures of photosynthesis have to be dismantled, and all the energy possible has to be packed up and delivered to the trunk for its winter reserve. That results in the exhilarating array of colors in the fall forests. The green of the leaf, from chlorophyll, breaks down, allowing the emergence of previously hidden yellow-orange pigments. All the changes render the leaf unstable and more vulnerable to solar rays than in the height of summer. The auburn, scarlet and ruby hues are caused by a chemical the leaf manufactures to help protect it from the sun. The same compound colors beets, raspberries and apples.

And while Washington and Maryland are reliably Democratic, Virginia is more of a swing state, giving Amazon potential champions from both parties. ""If you had your headquarters in a city and were responsible for tens of thousands of jobs, you could be seen as a good corporate citizen,"" said Richard Florida, a professor at the University of Toronto who has followed Amazon's urban development for more than two decades. The headquarters search centers on Amazon's seemingly insatiable appetite to hire enough of the talent it needs. To do so, the company says, it needs to be somewhere with a strong talent pipeline and the urban attributes, like public transportation and culture, that attract other employees to move. ""People want to be where there is vibrancy at the street level,"" said Jodie McLean, chief executive of Edens, a developer who has worked around the region and is involved with Washington's bid. The region is home to one of the most educated work forces in the country. Amazon already has a growing presence, with more than 2,500 employees in corporate and technical roles, like lobbyists in Washington and engineers at data centers in the Virginia suburbs serving government contracts. Nearby Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport has strong domestic connections, while Dulles International Airport links up globally. And the Metro rail network is one of the busiest in the country. After Amazon announced the headquarters search, lawmakers in the region approved $500 million in annual maintenance spending for the interstate Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, which oversees the subways. Crystal City is about as close to Washington as possible while still being in Virginia. It's one Metro stop away from National Airport, and just a few stops across the Potomac River from Washington. ""It is a dense, up-and-coming, mixed-used area that has a lot of opportunity for more development,"" Ms. Liu said. Other locations in Northern Virginia fit many of Amazon's requirements. But they're more suburban, and being in the middle of Seattle has become a central part of Amazon's identity. One question that looms over Crystal City, and Northern Virginia more broadly, is whether it is hip enough for the employees Amazon wants to attract. Crystal City is a jumble of mostly outdated, low-slung offices built decades ago for defense contractors, and a smattering of retail outlets. That has left it with a high vacancy rate, around 20 percent, according to JLL, a commercial real estate brokerage. Much of the South Lake Union neighborhood in Seattle was also a civic no-man's-land, filled with auto body repair shops and parking lots, before Amazon moved there. Some leases in Amazon's buildings require restaurants to stay open on weekends and through dinner hours — what Amazon called an ""18-hour district"" — but nearby cafes are often quiet after the happy hour rush subsides. Crystal City offers another parallel to Amazon's Seattle headquarters: Much of the land is owned by a single developer, which makes it easier to plan and build in a quick and cohesive way. Until recently, Amazon relied heavily on the investment firm of the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who died Monday, to build its Seattle campus. JBG Smith, a publicly traded investment trust, owns large swaths of Crystal City, and its chief executive, Matt Kelly, spoke before Mr. Bezos at the Economic Club, fueling yet another round of speculation among HQ2 watchers. ""Everybody is talking about Crystal City,"" said Stephen S. Fuller, a leading regional economist at George Mason University. ""The fit is good."" JBG Smith isn't commenting on Amazon, though in recent months it has hired a public relations agency to respond to HQ2 queries. In its latest investor filing, it said, ""Our focus is to put our best foot forward, expect nothing and hope for the best."" JBG Smith has big plans for Crystal City and has already signed Alamo Drafthouse, the movie theater chain, to anchor a new retail district. It's working with the local government to convert a highway that bisects the area into a more pleasant, tree-lined boulevard. ""Some of the dreaming that is going on is just waiting for an accelerant, and that's what I think Amazon would be,"" Dr. Fuller said. Among some in the region's real estate crowd, it has become almost a joke that Mr. Bezos should buy JBG Smith outright. ""If you are an opportunist, it looks like this would be of interest,"" Dr. Fuller said. ""And clearly Amazon has been opportunistic in their whole history."" Amazon may not have the patience and trust that Northern Virginia can be transformed, especially when Washington already is so rich, right across the Potomac. ""The District has magnificent neighborhoods and magnificent urbanity,"" Professor Florida said. Like everyone who guesses where HQ2 may land, he added a big caveat. ""I'm not in Jeff Bezos' mind,"" he said."
3,2018-10-18," (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good morning. New details of Jamal Khashoggi's death, the fate of the Amazon and a tour of Tuscany's biodynamic vineyards.  Here's the latest: • Gruesome details in the Khashoggi case. A senior Turkish official described audio recordings of the death of Jamal Khashoggi, the dissident Saudi journalist. Brace yourself. According to the official's account, killers were waiting for Mr. Khashoggi inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul two weeks ago. They severed his fingers during an interrogation. Then they beheaded and dismembered him. Above, Turkish investigators searching the residence of the Saudi consul. The new account came as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was in Turkey. It increases pressure on Saudi Arabia and the U.S. to explain Mr. Khashoggi's disappearance. Meanwhile, American intelligence officials have growing circumstantial evidence of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's involvement. And our Interpreter column examines why Mr. Khashoggi's case has drawn global attention, when the thousands of deaths in the Saudi-led war in Yemen have not. _____ • A student gunman  killed at least 19 people and wounded dozens more at a college in Kerch, Crimea. He was later found dead in his dorm with a gunshot wound. Above, a makeshift memorial near the scene of the attack. The assault, which marks the greatest loss of life in school violence in Russia since the Beslan terror attack in 2004, was initially classified as a terrorist attack, but officials reclassified it as a mass murder after discovering the shooter's student status. No motive has been reported, although a friend said the student was a loner who had expressed interest in the 1999 Columbine school shooting. _____ • Canada lights up. Pot enthusiasts, above, from Winnipeg to Montreal had ""End of Prohibition"" parties. Government-run dispensaries greeted a rush of customers. There was a ""bud drop"" at the stroke of midnight. It's been one day since Canada legalized recreational marijuana use, only the second country in the world to do so, reflecting its progressive politics. But critics worry about public health. And cannabis stocks didn't see a lift. _____ • DNA is complicated. Scientists who study the human genome have been dismayed to find their research misinterpreted and distorted by groups with racist agendas. They worry about how new tools allowing them to home in on the genetic basis of traits like intelligence could be misconstrued to fit racist ideologies, or misused to fuel arguments over school achievement gaps, immigration and policing. Scientists need to be more aware of the racial lens through which some of their findings are being filtered, one researcher said, and do a better job of pointing out how they can be twisted. _____ • The fate of the Amazon, the largest tropical forest in the world, could be shaped by the next president of Brazil. The front-runner in the Oct. 28 runoff is Jair Bolsonaro, above, a far-right congressman who has said that Brazil's environmental policy is ""suffocating the country"" and recently received an unwelcome endorsement from David Duke, the former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. Mr. Bolsonaro has promised to fold the Environment Ministry into the Agriculture Ministry, which tends to favor those who would convert forests into farmland. He also dismissed the idea of setting aside any reservations for native Brazilians, who have lived in the Amazon for centuries and may provide some of the best protection against deforestation.

Fall foliage is peaking around New York, home to many of your Briefings writers and editors. The yearly marvel never ceases to amaze us, so we wanted to share an explanation we first published a couple of years ago The leaves of deciduous trees change colors as nights lengthen and cooler weather prevails, according to the U.S. Forest Service. The structures of photosynthesis have to be dismantled, and all the energy possible has to be packed up and delivered to the trunk for its winter reserve. That results in the exhilarating array of colors in the fall forests. The green of the leaf, from chlorophyll, breaks down, allowing the emergence of previously hidden yellow-orange pigments. All the changes render the leaf unstable and more vulnerable to solar rays than in the height of summer. The auburn, scarlet and ruby hues are caused by a chemical the leaf manufactures to help protect it from the sun. The same compound colors beets, raspberries and apples. Halfway around the world, Japan's leaf season is also peaking. Theirs, called momijigari, offers a fall parallel to spring's cherry blossom festivals. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

0,2018-10-19," ""The Romanoffs,"" Amazon's new drama series in which characters are descendants of Russia's royal family, has not received the best reviews. ""What's most frustrating about 'The Romanoffs' is that there was clearly the potential for a decent show here, if it could have shed a few pounds of blubber and been given a stern talking to,"" Rebecca Nicholson wrote in The Guardian. James Poniewozik, in The New York Times, called it a ""series of ornate but ponderous creations, a shelf-busting set of Fabergé ostrich eggs."" But one of the harshest reviews has come from an unlikely source: The Romanovs themselves (the name can be spelled both ways). Well, from at least one member of the House of Romanov: the self-declared Grand Duchess Maria of Russia. The duchess is a resident of Spain who claims to be the rightful heir to the crown that disappeared from Russia during the Bolshevik Revolution. She is a great-great-granddaughter of Czar Alexander II, who was assassinated in 1881 and was a grandfather of Nicholas II, the czar who was killed, along with his wife and five children, by the Bolsheviks in 1918. On Wednesday, the duchess's chancellery (that is, her office) issued a news release on the show. ""The Chancellery of Her Imperial Highness concurs with the general consensus of the critics,"" it says. It then quotes the Rotten Tomatoes website's summary of reviews, saying the show is ""fatally indulgent, asking for the utmost patience from audiences without a compelling incentive."" [Read James Poniewozik's review of ""The Romanoffs.""] ""The Romanoffs"" is a drama in which each movie-length episode centers on characters who are meant to be descendants of Russian royalty, but are living today, such as an elderly woman in Paris struggling to cope with a Muslim caregiver, and an American man experiencing marital problems. The chancellery's news release said that descendants of the Russian crown have a ""fascinating history"" ripe for television. But the release said that Matthew Weiner, the creator of ""The Romanoffs,"" had squandered the chance to present that history. Instead, the release said, Mr. Weiner has made ""a series of plodding fictional stories on banal subjects of no consequence."" The chancellery would not have issued the release at all if ""The Romanoffs"" were simply dull, the release went on. ""Dullness may be disagreeable, but it seldom causes offense or insult,"" it said. ""Alas, to the series creator's great discredit, 'The Romanoffs' manages to do both."" The duchess's main problem appears to be the show's opening credits. These portray, somewhat comedically, the murder of Czar Nicholas II and his family. ""To see the martyrdom of the Imperial Family treated as a piece of gory entertainment"" — especially in the year of the 100th anniversary of their death — ""was appalling,"" the news release said. It also criticized a scene on a cruise ship where ""costumed dwarfs"" pretend to be the czar, his family and Grigory Rasputin, the notorious monk who befriended them. ""Surely standards of decency still count for something in the portrayal of certain events and the individuals involved,"" the release said. It was unclear if the duchess's views are shared by the many other people who are — or claim to be — descendants of the Romanovs. A spokeswoman for Princess Olga Romanoff, a great-niece of Czar Nicholas II who once appeared on a reality-TV program, said in an email that the princess ""has no comments at all concerning the Amazon series — she hasn't seen it."" Rostislav Romanov, a British-Russian painter and another descendant, did not respond to Facebook messages or an email seeking comment. Mr. Weiner, who also created the wildly popular ""Mad Men"" series, declined to be interviewed about the duchess's critiques. But her royal news release did not appear to have affected the show: A new episode was released on Friday."
0,2018-10-20," Peter Dinklage stars in the new HBO drama ""My Dinner with Hervé."" And ""The Illusionist"" arrives on Amazon Prime. MY DINNER WITH HERVÉ (2018) 8 p.m.  on HBO; also on HBO streaming platforms. In the summer of 1993, the journalist Sacha Gervasi flew to Los Angeles to interview the French actor Hervé Villechaize, who had starred in ""Fantasy Island"" and appeared in ""The Man With the Golden Gun."" Their conversation began as any other, then took a wild turn when Villechaize pulled a knife on Gervasi and asked him, ""'Would you like to hear the real story of my life?'"" That story was told over a raucous night out, and a week later, Villechaize committed suicide. This new drama — which has been 15 years in the making — revisits that surreal interview with moving performances by Jamie Dornan and Peter Dinklage. KILLER HIGH (2018) 9 p.m. on Syfy. There are plenty of reasons people dread high school reunions: awkward catch-ups, lost connections, the realization that not much has changed in 10 years. In this new horror comedy, a meticulously planned reunion offers all those delights but turns into a true nightmare when a murderous monster hunts down the guests. WOLVES AND WARRIORS 10 p.m. on Animal Planet. The first season of this series, which pairs combat veterans with wolves and wolf dogs that need rescuing, comes to a close. The host and Navy veteran Matt Simmons travels to Oklahoma to save 26 wolves who were secretly moved from a wildlife exhibition and fur-harvesting facility to a zoo. THE ILLUSIONIST (2006) on Amazon. This adaptation of a short story by Steven Millhauser stars Edward Norton as Eisenheim, a master illusionist in 1900s Vienna. As a boy, Eisenheim forms a deep bond with Sophie, the daughter of an aristocrat, but is torn away from her when their friendship is discovered. After crossing paths years later, when Sophie (Jessica Biel) is engaged to the violent and commanding Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), they start an affair and draw the suspicion of Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti). As Leopold and Uhl grow increasingly wary of Eisenheim's tricks, the magician turns to darker material that causes ripples within the monarchy. Writing in The New York Times, Stephen Holden designated the film a Critic's Pick and said that it gives Norton ""a role that perfectly fits his disturbing inscrutability."" 'TIL MADNESS DO US PART (2016) on Mubi. Watching this long documentary — the running time is nearly four hours — is more a fly-on-the-wall experience than anything else. The director Wang Bing spent more than two months in a remote mental hospital in southwestern China, filming the patients who stay on the top floor as they pass the time sleeping, talking and roaming the dirty halls. We rarely see the doctors, and it's unclear why the patients are there to begin with. But the film captures their strange existence, one that fluctuates from restless to serene and is seemingly forgotten outside the hospital doors."
0,2018-10-21," Here's what to expect in the week ahead: What was to be three days of mingling for world leaders and financial power players will have fewer boldface names when the Future Investment Initiative conference opens in Saudi Arabia's capital, Riyadh, on Tuesday. A number of major companies and their leaders have withdrawn from the event after the disappearance and killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi-born columnist for The Washington Post. Officials from companies including JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and BlackRock have withdrawn after Mr. Khashoggi disappeared in Turkey on Oct. 2. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has also said he would not attend the conference, as have ministers from Britain, France and the Netherlands. Ford Motor will report third-quarter earnings on Wednesday as concerns rise about the slow pace of its recovery plan. The company has been battered by the Trump administration's tariffs on steel and aluminum, and it hasn't yet revealed a full turnaround strategy, 18 months after Jim Hackett was named chief executive and tasked with revitalizing the automaker. In a reflection of Wall Street's pessimism, its stock has fallen more than 30 percent this year, to below $9, its lowest point in nearly a decade. Analysts expect Microsoft's earnings on Wednesday to show the company's resurgent growth, driven by a push into cloud computing, with revenue up about 13.5 percent over the previous year. Microsoft investors care most about its Azure cloud computing business, which last quarter grew 85 percent over the previous year and has become the leading competitor to Amazon's web services. The booming cloud market is one of the big, high-margin businesses investors expect to see grow in Amazon's earnings report on Thursday. Increasingly, Amazon's cloud, advertising and subscription offerings have become big and profitable enough to offset Amazon's investments in its resource-intensive retail business. Analysts expect the company's quarterly profit will be about $1.5 billion, almost five times what it earned in last year's third quarter. The European Central Bank will meet to discuss monetary policy on Thursday, in a markedly less certain economic environment than was the case a few weeks ago. Italy is defying eurozone spending rules; President Trump's trade war is taking a toll on growth; and Britain seems to be stumbling toward a disorderly exit from the European Union. The situation is not so grave that the bank's Governing Council is expected to alter its plan to slowly wind down the crisis measures it deployed during the last decade. But Mario Draghi, the central bank's president, may give a more cautious assessment of the eurozone economy when he holds a news conference after the meeting. Google's parent company, Alphabet, is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings on Thursday. In the previous quarter, Alphabet swallowed a $5.1 billion fine from the European Union for abusing its market dominance in smartphone software. In response to Europe's antitrust ruling, the company said last week that it would start charging handset manufacturers to install popular Google applications for phones running Android in the European Union. Google will probably face questions on how those plans may affect future results. Separately, Twitter is also set to report earnings on Thursday, with investors focused on whether there will be a continued decline in monthly users. The United States economy surged in the spring, growing at a 4.2 percent rate in the second quarter, the best mark since 2014. Don't expect a repeat performance when the Commerce Department releases third-quarter figures on Friday: Economists surveyed by FactSet expect the report to show a more modest 3.3 percent growth rate. Still, the economy looks to be on track for its best full-year performance in well over a decade. Many economists expect growth to cool later this year and early next, as the effects of tax cuts and increased government spending fade. But that slowdown, if it happens, won't be evident until after November's midterm elections, where Republicans are counting on the economy to help them hold off a ""blue wave"" of Democratic victories. Italy's ability to borrow money could suffer another blow when Standard & Poor's updates its rating of the country's debt on Friday. The decision, expected after markets close, will come a week after Moody's downgraded Italian government bonds to one notch above junk status, citing the populist government's deficit spending plan. The market interest rates on Italian debt rose to four-year highs after Moody's decision, and could rise further if S.&P. also issues a downgrade."
0,2018-10-23," Half a century ago, a typical Sears salesman could walk out of the store at retirement with a nest egg worth well over a million in today's dollars, feathered with company stock. A warehouse worker hired now at Amazon who stays until retirement would leave with a fraction of that. Much as Sears has declined in the intervening decades, so has the willingness of corporate America to share the rewards of success. Shareholders now come first and employees have been pushed to the back of the line. This shift is broader than a single company's culture, reflecting deep changes in how business is now conducted in America. Winner-take-some has evolved into winner-take-most or -all, and in many cases publicly traded companies are concentrating wealth, not spreading it. Profit-sharing and pensions are a rarity among the rank-and-file, while top executives take home an increasing share of the spoils. Amazon shareholders have benefited more than workers, but Sears, in its heyday, tried to serve both. The company earmarked 10 percent of pretax earnings for a retirement plan for full-time employees and by the 1950s, the workers owned a quarter of Sears. By contrast, one man at Amazon, the founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos, owns 16 percent of the company and is ranked as the world's richest person. Amazon, which changed how Americans shop much as Sears did in its prime, does not disclose what percentage of its stock is owned by employees. [Here's why some Amazon workers are fuming about their raise.] But this month, Amazon stopped giving stock to hundreds of thousands of employees, even as it lifted its minimum hourly wage to $15. While the raise garnered headlines, the move to curb stock awards may ultimately be more significant. Not only does it reverse what had been an unusually broad employee stock ownership program, Amazon's decision underscores how lower-paid employees across corporate America have been locked out of profit-sharing and stock grants. ""What's happened is that shareholders' interests have squeezed out other stakeholders,"" said Arthur C. Martinez, who ran Sears during the 1990s and was credited with a turnaround. ""The mantra is shareholders above all else."" Decades ago, he said, ""the people who produced or sold the product were more central than the people in the corporate suite. There was a different mind-set and it's linked to the larger issue of income inequality."" Not only was Sears's program generous, it was also remarkably egalitarian. Contributions were based on years of service, not rank, and the longest-serving workers received nearly $3 for every dollar they contributed. The company phased out the profit-sharing plan beginning in the 1970s. This month, after years of lackluster attempts at revival, the retailer filed for bankruptcy protection. Sears was hardly alone in corporate America, said Prof. Joseph R. Blasi, who directs Rutgers's Institute for the Study of Employee Ownership and Profit Sharing. Companies like Procter & Gamble, S.C. Johnson, Hallmark Cards and U.S. Steel all embraced profit-sharing and were part of a corporate movement to encourage the practice, he said. Among some leading executives in the early to mid-20th century, Professor Blasi said, ""there was a notion that wages were not enough and workers had a right to share in the fruits of their labor."" In the executive suite, however, profit-sharing still flourishes. While 68 percent of workers who earn more than $75,000 benefit from it, only 20 percent of workers earning less than $30,000 do, according to Professor Blasi. The decline of profit-sharing for the latter group has accelerated in recent years, with the median annual grant falling to $300 in 2014 from $921 in 2002. There are Amazon employees who hold a lot of stock. Four out of the top five executives earned less than $175,000 each in annual salary in the last three years, but got tens of millions of dollars in stock. By present-day standards, Amazon is relatively generous. In addition to 401(k)'s, full-time employees receive medical insurance and a week of paid vacation their first year. Fifty years ago, Sears provided all of that plus a much larger annual retirement contribution. While the typical Amazon employee receives $680 from the company in a 401(k), the average Sears worker got the present-day equivalent of $2,744. Dividends on accumulated stock could add thousands annually. The Sears approach was not without flaws. By putting much of its assets into company stock, it made workers even more exposed to their employer's fate. It also favored men over women, who lost out when they took time off or left earlier than male colleagues, according to Sanford Jacoby, a professor of management and public policy at University of California, Los Angeles. Still, it was very popular with employees. ""People were retiring with nice chunks of change,"" Professor Jacoby said. ""People loved this fund and Sears was a wildly successful company."" If Amazon's 575,000 total employees owned the same proportion of their employer's stock as the Sears workers did in the 1950s, they would each own shares worth $381,000. Until this month, Amazon had been awarding two shares a year to warehouse employees, worth about $3,500 at the current price. The loss of those grants will prevent employees from directly partaking in one of the greatest examples of wealth creation. To make up for the lost stock grants, Amazon has provided raises of at least $1.25 an hour to employees who had been earning over $15, plus cash bonuses at five, 10, 15 and 20 years of employment. Employees can put 401(k) contributions into Amazon shares. Several employees interviewed, who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, expressed disappointment. Amazon should have saved the dollar and kept giving workers stock, said one warehouse employee in Baltimore. Amazon insisted workers were not losing out. ""The significant increase in hourly cash wages effective Nov. 1 more than compensates for the phaseout of incentive pay and future stock grants,"" said a company spokeswoman, Ashley Robinson. But that approach could make workers feel less connected to Amazon's success, said Jeffrey D. Shulman, a professor of marketing at the University of Washington. ""Going forward, it almost becomes a zero-sum game,"" he said. ""Now when the company makes a decision, Amazon either puts money into the pockets of shareholders or employees."" The calculus was different at Sears, said Dan Fapp, a former communications executive who worked there from 1963 to 1999. ""If the company did well and the stock went up, your account was worth more,"" he said. ""It was not unusual for people to have $250,000 to $350,000 when they retired in the 1960s and early 1970s,"" Mr. Fapp said. That's worth well over $1 million today after adjusting for inflation. At stores, there were also opportunities for salespeople to increase their base salary through commissions. So-called Big Ticket Men, who sold more expensive goods, earned the equivalent of nearly $50,000 a year. Stanley Hreneczko, 91, started working at the Sears in Troy, Mich., in 1965. He was a salesman in the appliances department — selling stoves and refrigerators. Thanks to his generous pay and the corporate savings plan, Mr. Hreneczko bought a home in cash and took summer vacations to Arizona and Florida. ""It was like working in heaven,"" he said. Even junior employees were well taken care of. ""Most of these people retired with a good pension,"" said Jon White, who worked at Sears for 38 years, most recently as a manager in a store in Lithonia, Ga., before retiring in 2008. ""Most of them are comfortable for the most part — cashiers, clerks, replenishers, all kinds of workers."" Even after Sears scaled back its profit-sharing plan, workers benefited from a pension plan that held a diverse portfolio of stocks and bonds and provided fixed payments based on their salaries and tenure at the company. With Sears in bankruptcy, the federal government is expected to guarantee some or most of those pension payments. Unlike Sears, Amazon is growing rapidly and the company says it is working harder to increase opportunities for promotion from the warehouse floor into leadership positions. But its warehouses are staffed primarily by legions of lower-paid hourly employees. Of more than 2,000 workers at its fulfillment center in Carteret, N.J., all but 230 earn less than $17 an hour, or about $35,000 a year. During a recent tour there, one worker, Julia Teran, said she had received six shares during her three years at the company. ""I keep it for my retirement,"" Ms. Teran, 58, said of her stock, which is worth more than $10,000. How does she feel about the end of stock grants? ""Things change,"" she said with a half-smile."
0,2018-10-24," SEATTLE — Apple has its cash cow, the iPhone, which has made it the world's largest public company. Amazon transformed an array of industries, from logistics to the way consumers buy, to become the second largest. For Microsoft, which is gaining ground on Amazon, growth runs straight through the cloud. In the past several quarters, Microsoft's commercial cloud offerings have grown by big leaps, helping push the company's market cap to about $785 billion. On Wednesday, the company reported that the fast growth had continued in the latest quarter, as part of an earnings statement that beat analyst expectations and the company's own guidance across every segment of its business. Microsoft's first-quarter revenue was up 19 percent over the previous year, to $29.1 billion. Net income rose 34 percent, to $8.8 billion. ""We are seeing larger and longer-term customer commitments to the cloud,"" said Amy Hood, the company's chief financial officer. Shares in the company rose as much as 4.6 percent in aftermarket trading, in response to the earnings. During market hours, shares had fallen more than 5 percent in a marketwide sell-off. ""If you told an investor a few years ago that Microsoft is on the cusp of a $1 trillion market capitalization and could surpass Amazon, they'd think you were crazy,"" said Dan Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities. ""It speaks to how significant this cloud shift is, and what a strong hold Microsoft has on the cloud."" Amazon all but created the idea of cloud computing after it first built out remote data centers to store information and run advanced tools on its own data. But Microsoft has been gaining ground fast in recent years, establishing itself as the second-strongest provider. When Satya Nadella became chief executive in 2014, Microsoft largely depended on selling its Windows operating system on personal computers, even as smartphones were ascendant. He shifted the company to focus much more on its cloud computing business. The breakneck growth of Azure, Microsoft's core cloud offering, slowed more in the most recent quarter than some analysts had expected. It was up 76 percent, after several quarters of being up from 85 to 98 percent. And Azure may not even be profitable, said Karl Keirstead, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, as the company heavily invests engineering resources in new products and the construction of new data centers around the globe. But analysts and investors say the company is well positioned for the increasingly popular approach called ""hybrid cloud,"" which lets enterprises, like companies or government agencies, use one set of tools to manage what they store both on their own servers and on shared space in the cloud. ""Microsoft is unique in the sense that it has the ability to play in both environments,"" said Sid Parakh, a portfolio manager in Seattle at Becker Capital, which invests in Microsoft. ""Legacy customers are already working on Microsoft products, and it provides a level of continuity to transition to the cloud."" In a call with analysts, Mr. Nadella said that ""we don't think of hybrid as some stopgap to move to the cloud,"" and that Microsoft was investing in building out its hybrid offerings. ""This is a place where we are leading,"" he said. The company's year-over-year growth in server products and cloud services was 28 percent, which Ms. Hood said was a sign that the company was meeting customer demand. That makes it ""not a challenging decision"" to invest heavily in the cloud business, she said. And the company has money to spend in part because the legacy Windows business is still lucrative. ""They have been telegraphing that Azure's profitability is improving, and that is enough,"" Mr. Keirstead said. ""It is probably the most amazing growth engine we have seen inside Microsoft since basically the origins of the Windows business."" Another key part of the cloud transition is how Microsoft moved its suite of Office programs from software to the cloud, called Office 365. The product's revenue was up 36 percent in the first quarter. ""It's not as sexy Azure, but it's really important,"" said Keith Weiss, a Morgan Stanley analyst. ""It drives a lot of your profit."" Mr. Weiss said that once companies moved Office to the cloud, it was easier for Microsoft to sell them additional services, like video calls on Skype for Business or group chats on Microsoft Teams, a tool similar to the Slack messaging system. ""If you can get someone to pay you 20 percent more by just switching on some functionality, that's great for you,"" Mr. Weiss said. Aside from the core cloud business, Ms. Hood said, gaming revenue increased 44 percent, outperforming expectations as Microsoft expands its gaming platform. ""Fortnite is a key component of that, but it's not the only contributor,"" she said, referring to a popular game. LinkedIn revenue also had higher-than-expected revenue, up 33 percent over the previous year, as engagement increased. ""Right now, it's like they are firing on all cylinders,"" Mr. Ives of Wedbush said. ""The biggest risk to the name is that expectations have increased."""

2,2018-10-24," SEATTLE — Apple has its cash cow, the iPhone, which has made it the world's largest public company. Amazon transformed an array of industries, from logistics to the way consumers buy, to become the second largest. For Microsoft, which is gaining ground on Amazon, growth runs straight through the cloud. In the past several quarters, Microsoft's commercial cloud offerings have grown by big leaps, helping push the company's market cap to about $785 billion. On Wednesday, the company reported that the fast growth had continued in the latest quarter, as part of an earnings statement that beat analyst expectations and the company's own guidance across every segment of its business. Microsoft's first-quarter revenue was up 19 percent over the previous year, to $29.1 billion. Net income rose 34 percent, to $8.8 billion. ""We are seeing larger and longer-term customer commitments to the cloud,"" said Amy Hood, the company's chief financial officer. Shares in the company rose as much as 4.6 percent in aftermarket trading, in response to the earnings. During market hours, shares had fallen more than 5 percent in a marketwide sell-off. ""If you told an investor a few years ago that Microsoft is on the cusp of a $1 trillion market capitalization and could surpass Amazon, they'd think you were crazy,"" said Dan Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities. ""It speaks to how significant this cloud shift is, and what a strong hold Microsoft has on the cloud."" Amazon all but created the idea of cloud computing after it first built out remote data centers to store information and run advanced tools on its own data. But Microsoft has been gaining ground fast in recent years, establishing itself as the second-strongest provider. When Satya Nadella became chief executive in 2014, Microsoft largely depended on selling its Windows operating system on personal computers, even as smartphones were ascendant. He shifted the company to focus much more on its cloud computing business. The breakneck growth of Azure, Microsoft's core cloud offering, slowed more in the most recent quarter than some analysts had expected. It was up 76 percent, after several quarters of being up from 85 to 98 percent. And Azure may not even be profitable, said Karl Keirstead, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, as the company heavily invests engineering resources in new products and the construction of new data centers around the globe.

4,2018-10-24," You've heard of conscious uncoupling. But a conscious convenience store? Thus aspires the Goods Mart, which opened on Lafayette Street in SoHo on Monday, in a narrow space formerly occupied by a shop that served desserts in Mason jars.  Instead of Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal in dusty aisles, here there is cinnamon toast-flavored ""crunchy superfood clusters."" Instead of Pepsi and Coke, there is kombucha and some kind of CBD drink. There are no single-serve plastic bottles, as at the 48 7-Elevens around the city; there is no cat (alas), as at the local grocer. It's like a compressed version of Whole Foods, but without the compromised feeling of Amazon ownership.  The Goods Mart was founded by Rachel Krupa, 38, a publicist who saw social opportunity in mundane shopping. ""More than anything else right now, we want to know who our neighbors are, we want to talk to people, we want to have this connection,"" Ms. Krupa said. ""You can have that sometimes by going to a bar, but you can also have it with your everyday staples.""  Though not so much, perhaps, by getting them from a much-chastised vending machine company initially named Bodega, after the cherished New York institution, to widespread derision. Ms. Krupa is a convenience-store nostalgist, having frequented one in the Sunoco gas station in her small hometown in northeastern Michigan. ""It was that hub where you'd run into high school friends or neighbors,"" she said. ""If your mom said, 'Go get milk,' you'd go to get out of the house and see who else is there — is the guy that you're crushing on getting gas?"" In 2010, she started Krupa Consulting in Los Angeles, a firm that specializes in the promotion of eco-conscious brands of food and home goods. Ms. Krupa missed having that local hangout where she could pick up snacks and catch up with people in the community, and last year came up with the idea of a healthy convenience store, where she could make available a carefully chosen selection of products and offer shelf space to new brands, some of which she also represents. ""Bodegas have some great products, but they also have all of the other things,"" she said, meaning conventional candy and soda. ""It makes your process of selecting what you want much harder."" Everything the Goods Mart sells is non-G.M.O. and free of artificial flavors, preservatives and dyes. Some are organic or locally made. Ms. Krupa is trying to cull the offerings so shoppers don't succumb to a paralysis of choice. ""Instead of having 50 kombuchas, we have six or seven,"" which, she admitted, ""is still a lot."" The first Goods Mart opened in April in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, down the street from A.P.C. and Aesop stores, next to a low-priced carwash. Besides highfalutin versions of household staples (bamboo toothbrushes for $6.95, organic packaged ramen for $2.75), the Los Angeles Mart has a bulletin board advertising volunteering opportunities and trivia nights.  There is also a leafy green lounge, where, on a recent Saturday, people placed their laptops on repurposed buckets and tasted free samples of small-batch cottage cheese. The Los Angeles store accepts E.B.T. cards, issued by the state welfare department, and Ms. Krupa is waiting on government approval to do the same in New York. Produce past its prime, sourced from local farms, gets donated to homeless shelters, she said, where it can be used as ingredients in other food.  Goods Mart shoppers are prompted to tip a percentage of their bill upon checkout, and every month the store donates the tips to a local nonprofit. (NYC Parks Stewardship will be its first New York beneficiary.) ""She emailed us, introduced herself as the owner of this new business and told us about this practice they had instituted of donating tips,"" said Tina Christopulos, the co-chairwoman of fund-raising at Micheltorena Elementary School, a block away from the Silver Lake store. ""I was concerned, at first — would we be taking tips away from employees? She explained it further, and I was astonished, by the end of June, that they had raised over $1,000 for us."" ""I have stopped in half a dozen times,"" Ms. Christopulos said. ""They have delicious burritos,"" made by the restaurant Burritos La Palma, which was praised by the food critic Jonathan Gold. The other co-chairwoman of Micheltorena is a fan of the organic kombucha slushie — like a Slurpee, but without the high-fructose corn syrup. Last month, Ms. Krupa organized a happy hour for the school's students and gave out 100 organic Popsicles. On Oct. 27, the New York store will lead an outing to weed and add mulch to trees planted in SoHo. In September, Ms. Krupa leased an apartment on Mott Street, and she is continuing to work at her firm's New York office. She hopes eventually to arrive in the middle of the country, she said, ""where there's less access to the better options. If we could pop up on a heavily trafficked highway stop, or a place where younger families are starting to move, that's where we could really make a difference."""
0,2018-10-25," Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ Winning and losing may not be quite what they seem in the competition for Amazon's second headquarters. The $860 billion e-commerce company will soon decide where it's so-called HQ2 will be based. Only one of 20 finalist locations will be chosen, but the company invests and hires prodigiously in many urban areas — and will surely continue to do so. Mayors and governors from across North America have been making offers to Amazon since September 2017, when the company asked local governments to submit pitches to host a second corporate base that will complement its Seattle home. Amazon promised $5 billion in investment and 50,000 jobs over 10 to 15 years. New Jersey officials offered more than $7 billion in tax breaks for Newark's entry. Maryland estimated that its incentives on behalf of Montgomery County, adjacent to Washington, D.C., would be worth $5 billion. Victory will bring burdens as well as benefits. First is covering the cost of the incentives. Wisconsin's budget office believes that it will take 25 years to recoup the $3 billion in tax breaks that it granted to Taiwan's Foxconn last year for a liquid-crystal display plant built in the area. (And that doesn't include the subsequent $764 million in incentives from Racine County, which prompted Moody's to downgrade the county's debt rating.) Amazon and its planned 50,000 employees will also strain infrastructure. Home prices in Seattle have risen faster than anywhere in the United States except San Francisco since the Standard & Poor's CoreLogic Case-Shiller home price indexes began tracking real estate values 18 years ago. It's difficult to see how New Jersey could afford to spend lavishly on Amazon when the state a few years ago canceled a multi-billion-dollar overhaul of a critical century-old train link to New York City. Losers won't have those worries, and many will get a boost from Amazon anyway. According to the company's figures, it has invested more than $4 billion and taken on more than 5,000 employees in New Jersey alone between 2011 and 2017, which is roughly half the time span of the promised HQ2 development. Over the same period, Virginia secured $29 billion of investment and over 8,500 jobs from Amazon. Even Tennessee, which is home to the finalist city of Nashville, has received more than $5 billion of investment and 6,500 jobs. More of that kind of investment will be a handsome consolation prize — and the losers won't have any giveaways to justify, either."

2,2018-10-25," Amazon's profits were hit or miss for its first couple of decades. But now, for the first time, they are starting to look consistent — with four consecutive quarters above $1 billion in profit. On Thursday, the company reported a net income of $2.9 billion in the third quarter, surpassing analyst expectations. But the focus on profit that investors have long sought wasn't enough to keep them happy. The company's shares dropped more than 7 percent in aftermarket trading, after Amazon also announced that revenue in its core retail business was growing more slowly than in the past. The company's sales were up 29 percent to $56.6 billion, below what analysts had predicted. In Amazon's biggest business, its online store, sales rose just 11 percent over the past year. A year ago, the pace was twice as quick. ""They are saturating the core market in the U.S. for e-commerce,"" said Cooper Smith, who leads Amazon research for Gartner L2. ""This is a company in transition right now,"" moving from a focus on acquiring more customers to getting more growth from people who already shop the site. Profit was up in part because Amazon's leadership has focused on trimming costs to counteract the slower growth. ""We have really been able to cut back in a number of key areas,"" Brian Olsavsky, the company's chief financial officer, said in a call with reporters. He said the company saved money by redeploying engineers rather than hiring more new staff and being more efficient in its warehouses and data centers. About 613,000 people now work at Amazon, up 13 percent from the same time last year. Mr. Olsavsky said that over the course of 2017, the number of employees jumped 38 percent, not including its new Whole Foods workers. ""The theme will be banking some of the investment from prior years,"" Mr. Olsavsky said in a later call with analysts. Amazon has made a push in recent months to get more out of its high-margin areas, especially its industry-leading cloud computing services, a huge business with 31 percent operating margins this quarter. Its Prime memberships are another area: This year, Amazon raised the annual price of a Prime Membership by 20 percent, to $119. The number of new members signing up for Prime has been slowing, down to just 1 to 2 percent a quarter, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, a firm that surveys users for brands and investors. The company is also focused more on its advertising business. Amazon's website has had advertising such as Sponsored Products for years, but ads have recently become the company's fastest growing business. In September, it became the third-largest digital advertising service in the United States, behind just Facebook and Google, according to estimates from eMarketer. Ads provided a bright spot in the earnings, providing about $2.5 billion in revenue in their third quarter of triple-digit growth. Those lucrative markets let Amazon plow cash into new businesses that require intense physical investments and engineering talent, like expanding fast grocery delivery or building out its Alexa ecosystem. ""Now the investment is not a cycle — it's just a way of life,"" said Brian Nowak, who researches Amazon at Morgan Stanley. The company has been spending heavily in its international operations, in particular India, looking for its next enormous consumer market. International sales were up just 15 percent over the previous year, to $15.5 billion. Amazon's international sales are not profitable, though the margins are improving. The company is also building out same-day delivery, which drives sales but is expensive to offer, and offering new video content. And it has expanded into new markets, like pharmacies with its $1 billion PillPak acquisition this summer, and groceries with its Whole Foods acquisition. Amazon now offers Prime members free two-hour delivery from Whole Foods in more than 60 cities, reaching more than 17 percent of the American population, according to Morgan Stanley estimates. Early this month, Amazon announced it was raising the minimum wage for its warehouse and customer service workers to $15 an hour. The move, which Amazon said could affect more than 250,000 Amazon employees and more than 100,000 seasonal workers, came as the company started to look to attract workers for its holiday peak. As part of the wage increase, Amazon ended the bonus and stock grants it had been giving workers, which analysts estimated would offset some of the costs, as would increased efficiencies using robotics. Mr. Olsavsky declined to provide details of the costs associated with the new wage. The results are from a quarter in which Amazon briefly topped a trillion-dollar valuation, though it has fallen below that level since. ""One of Amazon's weapons against competitors is the confidence of Wall Street,"" Mr. Smith said, ""to be able to show that when we start a new business in a new category, we can send the value of legacy businesses in those industries plummeting."""
0,2018-10-26," Disappointing earnings reports from the tech giants Amazon and Alphabet set off another turbulent day on Wall Street on Friday, and the benchmark stock-market index briefly dipped into a correction.  Amazon ended down nearly 8 percent and Alphabet, the parent company of the search giant Google, fell 1.8 percent after they reported quarterly results on Thursday evening.  Their reports did little to calm jittery investors who have focused on quarterly corporate updates in search of clues to the economic outlook for 2019. Amazon's sales forecast for the coming holiday season fell short of investor hopes. And Alphabet's revenue fell short of analyst expectations.  ""The poor earnings are reflecting a slowdown in growth, not a disastrous slowdown, but enough to take stocks down,"" said Ilya Feygin, managing director at the institutional brokerage firm WallachBeth.  The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the broad measure of the United States stock market, tumbled throughout the morning, falling as much as 2.8 percent before clawing back some losses to finish down 1.7 percent. At one point, the early-day losses had the index down more than 10 percent below its recent peak on Sept. 20.  By the close of trading Friday, the S.&.P. was down more 9 percent from that late-September high, and is now in negative territory for the year. In financial markets, a drop of 10 percent or more is typically referred to as a correction — a term that describes a market sell-off that is more serious than a garden-variety slump. Such stumbles are not uncommon: Earlier this year markets fell more than 10 percent in a violent sell-off that ended in early February.  There was some indication on Friday that the sharp downturn in stocks had some investors reconsidering whether the Federal Reserve will go through with an interest rate hike at its next meeting in December. Analysis of interest rate futures suggested that there was less certainty about that rate hike than there had been even a few days ago, according to Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at BMO Capital Markets. Some pockets of the market sensitive to interest rates actually rallied, helping to cut losses. Shares of homebuilders, which have been hit hard this year rose more than 2 percent. Including this recent slide, six sell-offs have earned the correction designation since the current bull market for stocks began in March 2009. The nearly decade-long rise in stocks is one of the longest such runs on record.  But given the length of the current bull market — in which stocks have risen nearly 300 percent — investors have been uneasy.  ""The question is: Is this the top of a bull market? And is the recession going to start?"" said Julian Emanuel, chief equity strategist at institutional brokerage BTIG.  But those worries are not necessarily justified, Mr. Emanuel said. ""From our point of view, everything that we see tells us that a recession is not imminent,"" he said. Fresh economic data supports that view. Government numbers released on Friday showed that gross domestic product rose at a robust 3.5 percent annual pace during the third quarter. Third-quarter corporate profits — which public companies are currently releasing — are on pace to be up more than 20 percent.  Even so, there are factors that have dampened investor enthusiasm, including rising interest rates, slowing growth in China — the world's second-largest economy — and cost increases tied to the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. On Friday, the waves of selling, and the odd bit of buying, churned through the markets in a volatile session. Alphabet's share price was down as much as 5.5 percent and up as much as 1 percent before settling lower by 1.8 percent.  Investors continued to pound the share prices of companies that offered less optimistic outlooks for the coming year. Mohawk Industries, which makes carpet, hardwood flooring and vinyl tiling, plunged 23.9 percent after its earnings report on Friday fell short of expectations. The computer-drive maker Western Digital, which delivered disappointing results in its report after the market closed on Thursday, dove by 18 percent.  Not all corporate results have depressed the market. The information technology services firm Roper Technologies rose 7.6 percent on a solid earnings report on Friday, making it the best performing stock in the S.&P. 500. But on the whole, the technology sector continued its recent slump, as large and small companies alike continued to slide.  The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index dropped 2.1 percent, pulled lower by Facebook, which fell 3.7 percent, and Apple, which declined 1.6 percent. Both companies are scheduled to report earnings next week.  The Nasdaq is down nearly 11 percent this month, in a brutal reversal for the tech and software shares that had been a favorite for mutual funds, hedge funds and other institutional investors this year. ""We think that institutional money kind of got crowded into those kinds of names,"" said Kevin Dennean, Americas I.T. sector strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management. ""For whatever reason, you're seeing money come out of those high-growth software names."""
0,2018-10-31," Sam Esmail's ""Mr. Robot"" is one of the most audacious, inventive TV dramas of this decade. It is also, well, a lot. It's narratively and creatively maximalist, full of subplots, conspiracies, directorial triple back flips and twist upon baffling twist. Esmail directs all 10 episodes of ""Homecoming,"" a cerebral thriller that arrives on Amazon Friday, but he didn't write it; it's the creation of Eli Horowitz and Micah Bloomberg. Visually and thematically, it plays like a lean, focused distillation of Esmail's other series. It has the cool tone, the paranoia, the visual flourishes, the mind-bending revelations. But these effects are concentrated on a single, intricate story, laid out in 10 swift and magnetic episodes. In this case, less is very much more. The plot, of which it is best to say little, involves the corporatization of government, a favorite subject of ""Mr. Robot."" Heidi Bergman (Julia Roberts) has just started work as a counselor at the Homecoming center, a privately run facility for the reintegration of combat veterans, where she sees clients like Walter Cruz (Stephan James), a wry, good-natured veteran struggling with survivor's guilt. The Homecoming facility, set in a drab office park somewhere in Florida, is just there to help soldiers get on with life. You'll quickly supply the "" … or is it?"" yourself. In between sessions, Heidi fields hectoring calls from her boss, Colin Belfast (Bobby Cannavale), an executive for the Geist Group, the company running Homecoming. He is more interested in extracting ""data"" from the vets, for some unknown purpose, than helping them. Esmail's signature style leaps at you immediately: the god's-eye overhead shots, the image composition that puts you productively off-balance, the screen titles bigger than your living room. But the abundance of style serves the substance, creating an atmosphere of room-tone menace. Everything about the Homecoming center is bland and minimalist — ""hip but masculine,"" Colin calls the décor — and ""Homecoming"" understands that anonymous spaces, euphemism and depersonalized corporate-speak can be more terrifying than any jump scare. The most striking visual choice is the screen itself. The Homecoming scenes, set in 2018, are presented in typical wide-screen format. A second story line, four years in the future, is set off by black bars that squeeze the frame claustrophobically. In this future, Heidi is living with her mother (Sissy Spacek) and waiting tables at a dump of a restaurant. A customer, Thomas Carrasco (Shea Whigham) identifies himself as an auditor from the Department of Defense, investigating a complaint about Homecoming. Sorry, Heidi tells him; she has no memory of ever working there. In an age of streaming-TV bloat, ""Homecoming"" is five efficient hours, about 30 minutes per episode. It manages to be deliberative and propulsive at the same time. It builds momentum even as the first few episodes may seem to meander, and it comes together in a suspenseful thriller with an emotional punch. The series is adapted from a podcast by Horowitz and Bloomberg, which presented its story in a telegraphic, found-audio format: phone conversations, taped counseling sessions, voice messages. This version finds a TV correlative for that approach, constructing itself largely as a series of conversations. [Read about how a podcast was transformed into a TV show.] Its heart is the sessions between Cruz and Heidi, who develop a warm, work-spouse relationship. Roberts harks back here to her crusader-whistleblower roles (""Erin Brockovich,"" ""The Pelican Brief""), but with a reserved, layered performance. Heidi needs to work and wants to do good, and she realizes, with slowly dawning horror, that those aims are in conflict. Cannavale breathes pushy life into Colin, who's introduced as a stressed-out voice in split-screen phone conversations. Even when he interacts with other principals in the flesh, he's basically a human Bluetooth headset, a mouthy, Mametian bulldozer spewing coach-speak: ""Heidi, you are killing it! Fist bump!"" James and Whigham are also impressive in more understated roles. James brings an easy charisma to a character who's designed to be a puzzle. And Whigham (the blustery Eli in ""Boardwalk Empire""), as an introvert more at home digging through file folders than confronting suspects, makes a terrific hero-nerd. It takes a bureaucrat, after all, to uncover a crime of bureaucracy, if that's what's afoot here. Like the tech-focused ""Mr. Robot,"" ""Homecoming"" is about the relation of individuals to corrupted systems. It may only take one villain to conceive an ill deed, but when it's legitimized through the machinery of government and business, it becomes the work of many hands, like Heidi's. Often those people do what the soldiers treated at Homecoming do: They repress; they deflect; they crate up their feelings in a box. They tell themselves what Heidi's mother tells her: ""People make compromises. You did what you had to do. You took a job."" Part of what ""Homecoming"" asks is: How responsible do you have to be for a thing before you're morally responsible for it? How high up in an organization? In ""Homecoming,"" business is war by other means. And beyond its slickness and deft puzzle-story twists, this series is a perceptive study of the collateral damage."

As Thanksgiving approaches, a weary nation's thoughts turn to family entertainment. And food. So much food. In this month's roundup, we're paying special attention to the most crowd-pleasing TV series and movies coming to the major streaming services in November, with special favor bestowed upon anything tasty or nostalgic — good for families or for background viewing while basting. Below are the most interesting of what we've found, followed by a roundup of all the best new titles in all genres for Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and HBO. (Streaming services occasionally change schedules without giving notice.) 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' Starts streaming: Nov. 1, on Netflix. Getting ready for mashed potatoes? This movie has a mountain of them. But that doesn't make this 1977 Steven Spielberg classic a Thanksgiving movie. And it's not quite a family film in the traditional sense, either — not when the hero walks away from his wife and kids to go on a galactic joy ride. What ""Close Encounters"" is, is a paean to optimism — to the idea that world governments and the international scientific community could come together to plan a friendly welcome for some unexpected extraterrestrial visitors. The movie is a rare thing among sci-fi flicks, full of awe, humility and hope. It's pretty wonderful.— 'Invictus'  Starts streaming: Nov. 1, on HBO. South Africa, 1994: The World Cup of rugby is coming and South Africa has been allowed to compete again after years of international boycotts, and the newly inaugurated president, Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman), hopes the sport will help bring unity to his post-apartheid country. The mostly white national team, the Springboks, are despised by the country's black majority, which sees them as a lingering symbol of white oppression. So Mandela sends the team (including Matt Damon and the real-life Springbok McNeil Hendricks) on a good-will tour, traveling the country and coaching young black players in townships. The big game is a set piece of dense, roiling scrums, but the ultimate competition is for hearts and minds. [ Here is the New York Times's list of the best movies on Netflix right now. ]— 'Julie & Julia' Starts streaming: Nov. 1, on Netflix. Half of this movie — the half in which Meryl Streep cooks up a delicious performance as the great Julia Child — could have been a wonderful film on its own. Streep is a sweet, fluttery wonder, and her scenes with Stanley Tucci (playing Julia's husband, Paul) constitute a glowing portrait of deep married love. (Oh, and the food! Trussed chicken, boeuf bourguignon, Queen of Sheba chocolate cake … it's so mouthwatering.) The writer-director Nora Ephron stitches together Child's story with a true story set 50 years later, in which the food blogger Julie Powell (Amy Adams) cooks her way through Child's monumental ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking."" — 'Ocean's Eleven' Starts streaming: Nov. 1 on Hulu. With its breezy banter, snazzy editing and peppy score, this 2001 remake by Steven Soderbergh is a more enjoyable heist comedy than the Rat Pack original from 1960. Stepping into the Chairman's role, George Clooney is the very definition of dapper, and his caper cronies (Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, and the contortionist Shaobo Qin) seem to be having a blast. That's especially true of Pitt, who spends most of his time snacking.— 'Pleasantville'  Starts streaming: Nov. 1 on Hulu. Nostalgic for the era of ""Father Knows Best"" and ""The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet""? Two modern-day twin siblings — David (Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) — are zapped into the black-and-white world of a '50s family sitcom where everything is simple, sunny and heavily sanitized. (No need for toilets!) David and Jennifer are natural disrupters of period prejudice and social conformity, which of course makes them liberators, too. And as one after another TV citizen is set free of repression, coming fully alive in vivid color, we glimpse a vision of a better world to come.— 'Searching for Bobby Fischer'Starts streaming: Nov. 1 on Hulu. No chess expertise required: This movie is really about the personal costs of being a child prodigy. The film is based on Fred Waitzkin's book about his son, Josh (played here by a wide-eyed Max Pomeranc, an actual top-ranked chess whiz), who discovers his gifts among the chess hustlers of Washington Square Park (Laurence Fishburne chief among them). Josh then studies with an intense coach (Ben Kingsley), who insists that the boy develop a killer instinct. Can Josh become a top-level tournament player without sacrificing his childhood? — 'Homecoming' Season 1 Starts streaming: Nov. 2 on Amazon. Based on the podcast of the same name, ""Homecoming"" is a paranoid thriller (think ""The Conversation"" or ""The Parallax View"") that is parceled out over 10 half-hour episodes. Julia Roberts plays Heidi Bergman, a former counselor at an experimental-treatment center for soldiers with post-traumatic stress. When a Department of Defense investigator (Shea Whigham) shows up with questions about her time at the center, Heidi can't remember it; she doesn't even know how she wound up as a waitress at the greasy spoon. Like the podcast, this series has a sleek sound design, and director Sam Esmail (the creator of ""Mr. Robot"") brings great visual flair. Remember, it's not paranoia if they're really after you.— 'Oh My Ghost' Season 1 Starts streaming: Now, on Netflix. This sweet South Korean rom-com (with occasional thriller flourishes) features a randy ghost named Soon-ae, who thinks she's stuck on earth because she died a virgin. Determined to rectify that, she sets about inhabiting other women — and ends up inside of Bong-sun, a timid chef's assistant who could use a bit of supernatural self-esteem. This new, improved Bong-sun stands up for herself, flirts with her boss and, as a bonus, displays some dazzling kitchen savvy. One of the show's great charms is watching the way people in Bong-sun's life react to her lively new personality.— 'Wonder' Starts streaming: Nov. 2 on Amazon and Hulu. The 10-year-old Auggie Pullman (Jacob Tremblay) is a natural outsider, the victim of a cranial disorder and survivor of multiple corrective procedures that have left his face sadly distorted. Deeply loved by his home schooling parents (Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson), Auggie is belatedly enrolled in a Manhattan middle school, where he encounters the expected hostility from a few fellow students but also finds friendship and affection. Based on the best-selling novel by R.J. Palacio, the movie opens up into multiple points of view and ultimately demonstrates the need for both kindness and forgiveness. Kleenex required.— 'The Great British Baking Show' Season 6 Starts streaming: Nov. 9 on Netflix. This gentle competition show is comforting to watch, has lots of opportunities for in-jokes and will give you new faith in humanity — contestants actually help one another on this show. This season's new bakers are also a little more prone to tears or the occasional meltdown (looking at you, Rahul). Woman to watch: Kim-Joy Hewlett, a 27-year-old from Leeds who specializes in fantasy foods like mermaid pie, bumblebee eggs and space turtles. She needs her own program, or maybe her own universe. Warning: This is not a show to watch without nibbles nearby.— New to Netflix: ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (Nov. 1), ""Children of Men"" (Nov. 1), ""Cloverfield"" (Nov. 1), ""Doctor Strange"" (Nov. 1), ""The English Patient"" (Nov. 1), ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" (Nov. 1), ""Good Will Hunting"" (Nov. 1), ""Sex and the City: The Movie"" (Nov. 1), ""Sixteen Candles"" (Nov. 1), ""The Untold Tales of Armistead Maupin"" Season 1 (Nov. 1), ""The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep"" (Nov. 1), ""House of Cards"" Season 6 (Nov. 2), ""Outlaw King"" (Nov. 9), ""She-Ra and the Princesses of Power"" Season 1 (Nov. 16), ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" (Nov. 16), ""Jiro Dreams of Sushi"" (Nov. 22) and ""Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Gauntlet"" (Nov. 22).— New to Amazon Prime Video: ""The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"" (Nov. 1), ""The Adventures of Tintin"" (Nov. 1), ""The Birdcage"" (Nov. 1), ""Cruel Intentions"" (Nov. 1), ""Excalibur"" (Nov. 1), ""It's a Wonderful Life (Nov. 1), ""Jacob's Ladder"" (Nov. 1), ""Leaving Las Vegas"" (Nov. 1), ""Little Man Tate"" (Nov. 1), ""Lord of War"" (Nov. 1), ""Michael Clayton"" (Nov. 1), ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" (Nov. 1), ""My Girl"" (Nov. 1), ""Terms of Endearment"" (Nov. 1), ""Weird Science"" (Nov. 1), ""Kick-Ass"" (Nov. 3), ""The Children Act"" (Nov. 10), ""Little Women"" Season 1 (Nov. 20), ""Box of Moonlight"" (Nov. 21) and ""Loving Pablo"" (Nov. 21).— New to Hulu: ""28 Days Later"" (Nov. 1), ""The Accused"" (Nov. 1), ""The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"" (Nov. 1), ""Amelie"" (Nov. 1), ""The Big Lebowski"" (Nov. 1), ""The Birdcage"" (Nov. 1), ""Benny & Joon"" (Nov. 1), ""Existenz"" (Nov. 1), ""Hoosiers"" (Nov. 1), ""The Interpreter"" (Nov. 1), multiple ""James Bond"" titles (Nov. 1), ""Jane Eyre"" (Nov. 1), ""Leaving Las Vegas"" (Nov. 1), ""Little Man Tate"" (Nov. 1), ""Lord of War"" (Nov. 1), ""Map of the Human Heart"" (Nov. 1), ""Radio Days"" (Nov. 1), ""Rescue Dawn"" (Nov. 1), ""Rob Roy"" (Nov. 1), ""Soapdish"" (Nov. 1), ""Kick-Ass"" (Nov. 3), ""Monster's Ball"" (Nov. 11), ""The Wolfpack"" (Nov. 12) and ""Box of Moonlight"" (Nov. 21).— New to HBO: ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" (Nov. 1), ""Anywhere But Here"" (Nov. 1), ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" (Nov. 1), ""Hard Candy"" (Nov. 1), ""In the Name of the Father"" (Nov. 1), ""The Mask"" (Nov. 1), ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" (Nov. 1), ""Love, Simon"" (Nov. 10), ""The Emperor's Newest Clothes"" (Nov. 15) and ""My Brilliant Friend"" Season 1 premiere (Nov. 18)."
0,2018-11-02," IN YOUR HANDS By Inês Pedrosa Translated by Andrea Rosenberg 212 pp. Amazon Crossing. $24.95. This novel by a prizewinning Portuguese journalist intertwines the political and the personal through its incantatory prose. The first of Pedrosa's books to be published in English, it explores the lives of three generations of women in a wealthy Lisbon family, following them from the regime of the dictator António de Oliveira Salazar in the 1930s to the more democratic 1990s. Jenny, her daughter and granddaughter reveal their stories through diaries and letters, beginning with Jenny's account of her wedding to António, a compulsive gambler, and the ""secret sorrow"" she carries afterward: On her wedding night, she finds herself in the ""ludicrous circumstance"" of sleeping alone while António has sex with his lover, Pedro, in the next room. ""At first their intimacy was hard on me,"" Jenny confesses, but as time passes these three grow to love one another, ""the way children do, never crossing over into eroticism."" Six years after the marriage, Camilla, whose parentage is somewhat mysterious, arrives. While Jenny's lifelong passion remains António, Camilla's is her work as a photojournalist and ardent anticolonialist. Sent unwillingly on assignment to Mozambique to ""show continental Portugal our soldiers' great generosity in their civilizing mission,"" she falls in love with one of the guerrillas fighting against the regime, who is brutally killed before the birth of their daughter, Natália. Inevitably, the women scrutinize one another. Jenny sees Camilla as obsessed with her work and Natália as living a tepid life in which her ""mission is to liberate women like me from the terrible masculine yoke."" Natália, in turn, is terrified that she'll never be as formidable as her mother, who ""withstood prison and torture,"" and bemoans her life amid the ""indifference and regurgitation that we call the postmodern era."" One constant in their lives is the family manse. Dilapidated by the time Natália reaches adulthood, Chess House becomes her passionate project. When she uses her skill as an architect to salvage this relic of the family's heritage, she brings a novel that's absorbing in its history, as well as in its family dynamics, back to the place where it began. THE HOPE FAULT By Tracy Farr 336 pp. Aardvark Bureau. Paper, $14.95. It's hard to decide whether the central character in Farr's novel is a saint, a martyr or just more zenlike than the rest of us. With her grown son, Kurt, and teenage niece, Luce, Iris Golden drives under a ""thick, dark cloud that fills the sky"" to the bayside vacation house that she and her ex-husband, Paul, have sold in the fictional Australian village of Cassetown, intending to pack up their belongings over a long winter weekend. Paul arrives that evening with his second wife (""rested, resilient, remarkable,"" Iris wistfully observes, a woman filled with ""the vigor of youth, and love"") and their infant daughter (who is, significantly, unnamed). As they're hauling their gear inside, the dark cloud releases a deluge. Later, the rain, almost a character in itself, will be ""battering against their dreams,"" ease ""to mist,"" fall ""hard on the roof"" and then kick in again, ""suddenly torrential, monumental."" That so many characters have geologic surnames (Iris Golden, Paul and Kurt Diamond, Luce Flint) is no coincidence. As the novel unfolds, so too do the details of an affair between Iris's mother, Rosa, now a nonagenarian with dementia, and a German-Israeli geologist, Zigi Silbermann (""silver man""), a relationship described by Rosa in fittingly nonsequential flashbacks. Zigi maps fault lines, including the Hope Fault, a handy metaphor for the ever-shifting and sometimes dangerous terrain of family life. He also writes poetry, a volume of which, also called ""The Hope Fault,"" is found on a bookshelf. Despite the foreboding weather that forces the family to stay inside in dangerously close quarters, they somehow pull through, and even have time for a blowout party and a baby-naming ceremony before the movers arrive, an ending that, along with the rest of the novel, only the most determined optimist will find plausible. NEWS OF OUR LOVED ONES By Abigail DeWitt 222 pp. Harper. $25.99. Exploring the physical and emotional landscape of war and its aftermath, DeWitt's novel traces the history of the Delasalle family from World War II into the decades that follow, moving, not always seamlessly, between past and present. Geneviève, Yvonne and Françoise live with their mother and stepfather, Oncle Henri, in the seaside Norman town of Caen, which has been occupied by the Nazis: ""Every week brought the announcement of a new set of rules … and all we thought about was food."" As the war gains momentum, Geneviève goes to Paris to further her study of the violin. There, a year after the armistice, she meets the American cellist who will become her husband, with whom she sets sail for the United States. Yet even in the safety of North Carolina, even though the war is long over, Geneviève is haunted by her memories of its deprivations, of the ""bombs and rubble and prison and torture"" that wrought irrevocable changes in her family. It's not surprising, then, that her American-born daughter drinks ""the war in with her mother's milk."" At one point, she notes that although ""the war had been over for 15 years when I was born … still the sound of German unsettles me."" The narrative passes quickly, and sometimes chaotically, from person to person as DeWitt writes from multiple points of view, linking the stories of a host of characters, including not just the women of the family but Marie-Claire, a girl from the mountain town of Les Houches, and a nameless SS officer met while filling out the paperwork on a Jewish pediatrician who has been arrested by the Germans. While the revolving cast and leaps between historical eras can be confusing, the narrative's details of daily life — a patisserie ""with its bright little door chime and the smell of chocolate. Shop girls in their crisp, white coats, like doctors""; a Nazi informant, detectable from ""the delicious scent of pâté and cognac on her breath"" — ultimately pull the reader along."
0,2018-11-04," SAN FRANCISCO — More than 450 antiquarian book dealers in at least 26 countries pulled their books off an Amazon subsidiary on Monday, an impromptu protest after the site abruptly said it would drop all sellers from several nations. The flash strike against AbeBooks, which removed over 2.5 million books from the marketplace, is a rare concerted action by vendors against Amazon, which depends on third-party sellers for much of its merchandise and revenue. The protest arrives as increasing attention is being paid to the extensive power that Amazon wields as a retailer — a power that is greatest in books. The stores are calling their action Banned Booksellers Week. The protest got its start after AbeBooks sent emails last month to booksellers in countries including South Korea, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Russia to say that it would no longer ""support"" them. ""We apologize for this inconvenience,"" the company said. As the news spread, even unaffected dealers were surprised and angered. AbeBooks, together with Amazon itself, is by far the biggest international marketplace for secondhand and rare books. AbeBooks lists millions of books and manages the payments. The booksellers mail the books directly from their shops. The platform was founded in 1995 and was bought by Amazon in 2008. It continues to operate independently, and many of its customers never even realize who the owner is. AbeBooks is based in Victoria, British Columbia, where it started. The Amazon subsidiary told the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers that it was scaling back because ""it is no longer viable for us to operate in these countries due to increasing costs and complexities."" The reaction was fierce. ""AbeBooks is saying, 'We're cutting you and your country off. It's nothing you did, we just decided we don't want to deal with you anymore,'"" said Scott Brown, a bookseller in Eureka, Calif. ""It's infuriating."" One of the affected booksellers was Antikvariat Valentinska, a large antiquarian store in the center of Prague. ""The decision to close our account on such short notice has come as a complete shock, especially since no reason was given, not even upon request,"" the store said in a statement. ""Just our company alone will almost certainly have to dismiss at least five employees."" Peter Harrington, a leading London antiquarian dealer, said AbeBooks' ""high-handed manner"" was at the root of the protest, with the platform taking the affected booksellers and ""destroying their livelihoods in just a couple of impersonal sentences."" Last week, the Antiquarian Booksellers' Association, based in London, responded by saying it would drop AbeBooks as a sponsor of its 2019 book fair. ""Our mission is to champion the highest standards of rare bookselling across the world, irrespective of location,"" the association said. ""Sadly we feel that AbeBooks is not a suitable fair sponsor for us at this time."" Simon Beattie, a British bookseller, set in motion the impromptu strike on Thursday afternoon. ""I have decided to put my books on (permanent) vacation on ABE in solidarity with fellow booksellers in the Czech Republic, Hungary, South Korea and Russia,"" he wrote to colleagues. ""I hope you might like to follow suit."" In the tight-knit, if loosely organized, antiquarian community, the idea quickly spread. On Saturday night, in response to a query from a reporter, AbeBooks issued a statement saying it was dropping the countries because ""our third-party payment service provider is closing at the end of the year."" It added that, ""We regret that we cannot continue to serve all sellers."" Asked how many booksellers and countries were affected, Richard Davies, an AbeBooks spokesman, said, ""I am not adding anything else to that statement."" Mr. Brown, one of the dealers organizing the protests, said that for many of the booksellers, AbeBooks' actions underlined both Amazon's power and its refusal to be accountable for it. ""The biggest e-commerce giant in the world apparently finds it too complicated to do business in Prague,"" he said. ""You have to wonder who's next. We're all vulnerable to Amazon's capricious actions."" Underlying the mystifying nature of the action, Amazon itself is still selling merchandise from the banned countries, including books. Since Abebooks controls its storefront, the only recourse the protesting booksellers have is to tell it that they are ""on vacation."" The marketplace then puts a message next to their name saying, ""This member's inventory is temporarily offline. Please check back later."" There was no acknowledgment that this was not business as usual."
1,2018-11-04," CACHICHIRA, Bolivia — The hunt began at nightfall under a crescent moon and with a chorus of frogs, which suddenly went silent when the rifles fired and the thrashing erupted. The bodies were dragged onto the deck of three boats: Six crocodilians were landed one night and 14 the next. Some were nearly eight feet long, head to tail. As gastronomy leaps from one trend to the next, the search for the next new thing has become a quest without end for many chic restaurants. And the role of the chef is changing, too: The greatest cooks these days are also the greatest storytellers, not just serving up meals, but also long yarns about the who, what and where of the origins of their ingredients. Which is why I was with some of the finest chefs in the Andes at Lake Colorada in northwestern Bolivia, home of the spectacled caiman — a relative of the alligator. Once every few years, a group of cooks and owners from acclaimed restaurants in Bolivia, Argentina and Peru hire a river boat to take them to places unlisted in the Michelin Guide and where no food critic has likely ever dared to tread. Here, at the lake and along the Beni River in the Bolivian Amazon basin, the restaurateurs were hunting for something new to cook. They said I could join them on this adventure, and on an October day I went ashore with the chefs at an indigenous village of the Tacana people, whose caiman-hunting season had just begun. The Tacanas had sent a delegation ahead to greet their visitors: A notary who takes caiman measurements, the village mayor who cuts fillets and two sharpshooters chewing huge wads of coca leaf which keeps them up at night as they spot the caiman's eyes with flashlights from a canoe. The caiman hunt would not be the only tale for the chefs on this trip for exotic new foods. Consider the big fish story to be told about the paiche, a freshwater monster that looks like a carp, but far larger and prehistoric-looking. Or the tale of cacao beans picked in the fall from trees that grow wild around the village of Carmen del Emero and which are composted in an undergrowth of strangler figs and jaguar droppings. Or the story of tuyo tuyo, the larvae of a beetle that lives in an Amazonian palm tree, long a delicacy in these parts and more recently served as an appetizer at Gustu, a famed restaurant in Bolivia's capital, La Paz. ""We are seeing things hanging in your kitchens, foods you might not think people in cities would be interested in,"" Marsia Taha, the head chef at Gustu, said one night to the elders in the village. ""These are the things we are looking to buy."" The food stories flow both ways, and sometimes, it's the outsiders who teach the locals about what's edible in this jungle. ""Callampa,"" said Mauricio Barbón, the head chef at Amaz, a Lima, Peru, restaurant that specializes in using Amazonian ingredients. He was pointing to a fallen log with shelves of a flesh-colored fungus growing on it. ""We've never tried it before,"" said an intrigued Javier Duri Matias, a young Tacana leader who was showing us through the forest. The fungus looked almost exactly like an ear. Mr. Barbón explained that his recipe calls for blanching the fungus in water before it is served. He tore off a piece, and we chewed away, savoring the spicy aftertaste while also hoping the chef was correct in the identification of his mushroom. As for the caimans in the lake, they are as much an experiment for conservationists as the chefs. A management program sets strict limits on how many may be hunted, of what size and when during the year. The Tacanas have learned they can earn far more selling certified pelts for export than they made when the hunting was uncontrolled. Now, the clan is also selling the flesh to these enterprising chefs. ""Meat was always, if you will, on the table as another resource that would allow them to get more out of every animal,"" said Rob Wallace, a director at the Wildlife Conservation Society in Bolivia, a nongovernmental group that helped the Tacanas develop the conservation plan for the caiman. The hunt, which goes on for several weeks in October, was a family affair. Mothers helped skin the meat as a baby swung in a hammock nearby. Others in the village played games with a large, luckless river turtle that lay on its backside, glum and unable to right itself. In the village, caiman was not the only meat on the menu. At one meal, the chefs discovered a giant tapir — a plant-eating mammal about the size of a pig with a short trunk — roasting on a grill and helped themselves to the ribs. ""I have never seen one dismembered this way,"" said Mr. Barbón, licking his fingers. ""It is truly delicious."" Bernardo Resnikowski, a restaurant manager who wears luxurious sleeve tattoos and moonlights as a D.J., later arrived with two Tacana men carrying machetes and a bowl of red, slightly fermenting fruit, called kecho, which he shared with Ms. Taha and Mr. Barbón. ""Not enough flesh to eat, but you might blend them in a cocktail"" was Ms. Taha's verdict as she threw a handful into her mouth. By the time the party next saw the firepit, there were no signs of the tapir. Instead, the giant river turtle had taken its place, doomed to the grill with its shell cracked open and stuffed with potatoes and chili peppers. An old Tacana recipe book contains a litany of ways to make peta, their name for the creature, but the chefs seemed doubtful about the taste of the gooey innards, chewy skin and orphaned paws sitting atop rice. ""This kind of meat wouldn't be legal to sell anyway, though the Tacanas are allowed to serve it in their villages,"" Ms. Taha explained, saying the measure was to protect turtle populations. ""Who said we would sell it to you if it were legal?"" barked Eduardo Cartagena, one of the village leaders, evidently enjoying his share of the turtle. As night settled, the Tacanas were back on Lake Colorada. I sat in the back of a leaky canoe as Rene Rubén Lurici Aguilara, a sharpshooter, stood at the bow, a flashlight wedged between his chin and his shoulder, his rifle scanning the surface of the water. A pair of caiman eyes surfaced, glowing gold in the light of the torch. The hunter took aim. Not quick enough. The caiman submerged, submarine-like. It was the lucky one. By 1 a.m., our boat was heavy with the weight of the bodies of five large reptiles. While Gustu has been selling the caiman meat for some time, Amaz, in Lima, has had trouble getting a license to import the meat into Peru. But over breakfast Mr. Barbón, the Amaz chef, couldn't help but daydream about how he might serve up caiman meat one day for his customers, who have included the celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain. ""We would try to fry it,"" he said. ""Frying is something everyone knows. What would you all do with it?"" ""We try to use everything, down to the tail,"" said Gabriela Lafuente, the owner of El Baqueano in Buenos Aires, who purchases meat from a crocodile farm in Argentina.

For the 1896 presidential election between William McKinley and William Jennings Bryan, there was an intense competition among newspapers to provide results to the crowds gathered outside their offices. In New York, The Tribune built a display of lights, alternating green and red with different numbers of white lights to signal each state's result. The paper first tried to send the display aloft on a kite, but the wind weakened, so the display was instead hung on the spire of the building. The World projected enormous bulletins over nearly its entire 20-story building across from City Hall, and The Herald shined a beacon from atop its building. At The Times, the new owner, Adolph Ochs, thought his paper's own efforts — projections on two screens in town — fell short. So when Mr. Ochs commissioned a new building in what would be renamed Times Square, he insisted that a searchlight be installed at the top. When the tower opened, just before the 1904 election, it was the city's second tallest. That night, and for election nights almost until the building was sold in 1961, a needle of light pointed out the winners.

1,2018-11-06," The prune capital of America. That was the future Silicon Valley's greatest claim to fame in the 1920s, when it was a sleepy landscape of fruit orchards and farms far removed from the nation's industrial might. Seattle was a city of fishing and timber, where a young entrepreneur named Bill Boeing had so few customers for his airplanes that he briefly pivoted to making furniture. The most innovative companies in the world clustered in the ferociously inventive cities of the East and Midwest — cars in Detroit; cash registers in Dayton, Ohio; light bulbs in Cleveland. The high-tech geography began to flip in the 1950s, as electronics and aerospace boomed. Before the Eisenhower era was over, cities across the country and across the globe had started racing to capture some of the West Coast's high-tech magic. Silicon Valley and Seattle are now a long way from biplanes and prunes. No surprise, then, that when Amazon's founder and C.E.O., Jeff Bezos, announced last fall that his company would build ""a full equal to our Seattle headquarters,"" 238 places bid to become HQ, including Detroit, Dayton and Cleveland. The 50,000 tech jobs promised by Amazon are well worth a city's spending millions in tax breaks and infrastructure. Amazon is now reportedly close to announcing a decision to divide the next headquarters between Long Island City, Queens, and Northern Virginia. So what can the new HQ2 city or cities learn from high-tech history? First and foremost: Yes, tech companies are a prize worth chasing. They offer jobs that are well-paying and productive, and attract a highly educated work force. Under the right conditions — the presence of strong research universities, access to capital and a quality of life that draws people in and keeps them there — a well-rooted tech community can seed several successive generations of companies, with the entrepreneurs of one era becoming mentors and investors and civic philanthropists in the next. This is what happened in Boston, in Silicon Valley and in Seattle, whose tech scene includes not only Amazon and Microsoft but also a wide variety of spinoff companies, as well as Facebook, Google, Alibaba and Baidu. Second: The new HQ2 will have to resolve a central paradox of the modern technology company. Silicon Valley and Seattle have both grown during an era of mass suburbanization. The technology firms they nurtured developed a preference for amenity-rich, self-contained corporate campuses, turning away from the older and more crowded cities where the high-tech industry had started: New York City, once home to Bell Labs; Philadelphia, the birthplace of the first all-digital computer. The most dramatic recent example is Apple's giant new glass-and-steel spaceship, which just landed in Cupertino, Calif. Now an increasing number of tech companies — Amazon among them — have chosen to locate or expand in the urban core. But the tech bubble has often come with them, resulting in self-contained environments with tight security, filled with free food and perks that keep workers at their desks rather than exploring the streets outside. San Francisco and Seattle were ill prepared for the tech wave that hit in the past decade. Current responses range from the promising but piecemeal (Amazon subsidizing additional city bus service in Seattle) to the impractical and divisive (San Francisco considering a ban on employee cafeterias in new office buildings to force tech workers to patronize local restaurants). Although tech companies and cities often find themselves fiercely opposed in these debates — most hotly in the recent attempt by Seattle to tax large employers like Amazon to pay for homeless services — there is some recognition on both sides that the current patterns are unsustainable. Growth challenges are already familiar ones in New York City and metropolitan Washington, D.C., where once-affordable neighborhoods have morphed into upmarket enclaves, and aging and overloaded transit systems create daily headaches for their millions of riders. Just as in San Francisco and Seattle, HQ2's arrival could make them far worse. This doesn't have to happen. HQ2 is an opportunity to do things differently. Amazon has an opportunity to forge a new approach, one where big tech is neither savior nor antagonist. Jeff Bezos and his leadership team can apply the strategic thinking that has made Amazon such an extraordinary company to the task of building a tech hub that encourages growth and widens opportunity.  This means breaking out of the bubble and redefining the corporate bottom line to include measures that reduce inequality, sustain existing small businesses and protect housing affordability, and, yes, even supporting cities in raising the tax revenue they need. This isn't an impossible dream. The secret of Silicon Valley wasn't tax breaks and cheap real estate; it was a postwar era of generous public spending on research and education, as well as on affordable housing and public infrastructure. These investments were designed to help everyone, but they were critical to helping tech flourish. No place or industry rules forever. Ask Detroit, once the most innovative place in America. The new capitals of tech should not take this prosperity for granted."
2,2018-11-06," SEATTLE — After conducting a yearlong search for a second home, Amazon has switched gears and is now finalizing plans to have a total of 50,000 employees in two locations, according to people familiar with the decision-making process. The company is nearing a deal to move to the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, according to two of the people briefed on the discussions. Amazon is also close to a deal to move to the Crystal City area of Arlington, Va., a Washington suburb, one of the people said. Amazon already has more employees in those two areas than anywhere else outside of Seattle, its home base, and the Bay Area. Amazon executives met two weeks ago with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in the governor's Manhattan office, said one of the people briefed on the process, adding that the state had offered potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies. Executives met separately with Mayor Bill de Blasio, a person briefed on that discussion said. Long Island City is a short subway ride across the East River from Midtown Manhattan. [Read more on the fast-growing Queens neighborhood of Long Island City could be doing to prepare for Amazon.] ""I am doing everything I can,"" Governor Cuomo told reporters when asked Monday about the state's efforts to lure the company. ""We have a great incentive package,"" he said. ""I'll change my name to Amazon Cuomo if that's what it takes,"" Governor Cuomo said. ""Because it would be a great economic boost."" The need to hire tens of thousands of high-tech workers has been the driving force behind the search, leading many to expect it to land in a major East Coast metropolitan area. Many experts have pointed to Crystal City as a front-runner, because of its strong public transit, educated work force and proximity to Washington. [Crystal City's upsides: good transit, diverse residents, a friendly business climate and a single developer with a big chunk of land.] JBG Smith, a developer who owns much of the land in Crystal City, declined to comment, as did Arlington County officials. Amazon declined to comment on whether it had made any final decisions. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported Amazon's decision to pick two new locations instead of one. About 1,800 people in advertising, fashion and publishing already work for Amazon in New York, and roughly 2,500 corporate and technical employees work in Northern Virginia and Washington. Amazon narrowed the list to 20 cities in January, and in recent weeks, smaller locations appeared to fall out of the running. For example, although Denver made the initial cut, Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado said last month, ""Wouldn't they rather have their second big hub on the East Coast?"" Amazon announced plans for a second headquarters in September 2017, saying that the company was growing faster than it could hire in its hometown Seattle. The company said it would invest more than $5 billion over almost two decades in a second headquarters, hiring as many as 50,000 full-time employees that would earn more than $100,000 a year on average. HQ2 would be ""full equal to our current campus in Seattle,"" the company said. If Amazon goes ahead with two new sites, it is unclear whether the company would refer to both of the locations as headquarters or if they would amount to large satellite offices. Picking multiple sites would allow it to tap into two pools of talented labor and perhaps avoid being blamed for all of the housing and traffic woes of dominating a single area. It could also give the company greater leverage in negotiating tax incentives, experts said. ""Even if the most obvious reasons appear to be about attracting more tech workers, the P.R. and government incentives benefits could help, too,"" said Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed, the online jobs site. With big presences in two cities, the local governments ""might feel pressure to increase the incentives they are offering Amazon, and the surprise is yet another news cycle for the Amazon headquarters process,"" he said. The HQ2 search sent states and cities into a frenzied bidding war. Some hired McKinsey & Company and other outside consultants to help them with their bids, investing heavily in courting Amazon and its promise of 50,000 jobs. Even half of that would amount to one of the largest corporate location deals, according to Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, which tracks corporate subsidies. ""These are very big numbers,"" he said. As Amazon's search dragged on, residents in many of 20 finalist cities worried about the impact such a massive project could have on housing and traffic, as well as what potential tax incentives could cost the community. The decision to split into two sites could alleviate some of that resistance. Seattle has been one of the fastest growing cities in the country, in part because of Amazon's growth. The company has about 45,000 employees in the city, and the company said it needed to hire more employees than the city could attract or absorb. ""Not everybody wants to live in the Northwest,"" Jeff Wilke, the head of Amazon's retail division, said at a conference last year. ""It's been terrific for me and my family, but I think we may find another location allows us to recruit a different collection of employees."" Amazon gave cities six weeks to pitch themselves in a public courtship. Almost 240 municipalities responded, trying to lure the tech giant with marketing gimmicks, promises of new transit lines and, as proposals trickled out, billions in tax incentives. The details of most bids are not public, to the frustration of even some lawmakers. A few elected officials from the short list of 20 cities signed what amounted to a mutual nonaggression pact, trying to avoid a bidding war that would give up too much from taxpayers. But mostly, cities continued their hard sell, showing Amazon executives around their proposed sites and trying to assure the company that the region had sufficient housing and transportation. Since wrapping up visits with cities in the spring, Amazon has been almost silent on the search. That led journalists, residents and politicians to look for clues in new job postings and the flight path of the corporate jet used by Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive. To meet its own deadlines, Amazon will need to move fast. It had said it wanted 500,000 square feet of office space — enough for thousands of employees — available for use next year. Jay Brodsky, who lives in Arlington, Va., said about a week ago that his wife took part in a 45-minute phone survey about her opinion if Amazon moved to the area. ""It was everything from, 'What do you think about the local government,' to 'Are you concerned about traffic?'"" he said. She received an Amazon gift card for participating. ""People are sort of on pins and needles,"" Mr. Brodsky said. ""It's almost like people want it to happen, and are afraid of what would happen if it does."""
3,2018-11-06," SAN FRANCISCO — What a farce. That was one of the immediate reactions when word leaked out on Monday that Amazon's much-ballyhooed search for a second headquarters outside of Seattle would result in not one, but two new locations. On Twitter, people used farce, sham or stunt to describe what had happened. Amazon's critics were apoplectic at what they called a bait-and-switch. ""I was shocked,"" said Robert B. Engel of the Free & Fair Markets Initiative, a nonprofit that is a determined foe of the retailer on all fronts. ""They've duped more than the bidders. They've duped all of us. They can't even live up to a promise that wasn't fair to anyone but Amazon."" From the company's point of view, however, things seem to be working out rather nicely. The quest kept a persistent spotlight on Amazon as the suitor everyone sought — would it choose Denver? maybe Atlanta? surely Chicago? — even as the company apparently decided instead to set up smaller operations in the Washington metro area and in New York City, the two most obvious places all along. (Amazon declined to comment.) Amid the guessing game, the company got information from dozens of cities about how much they would pay for a strong Amazon presence, valuable data that it will no doubt use to expand. ""What we see is Amazon evolving into a corporation whose headquarters is virtual and whose physical presence will span the globe,"" said Charles R. T. O'Kelley, director of the Berle Center on Corporations, Law and Society at Seattle University. ""Instead of being headquartered in one place and moving to a second headquarters, Amazon is going to be, and be thought of as, everywhere."" This, after all, is how Amazon sees its destiny: to become not just the everything store, as it was branded a mere five years ago, but the everything company. People will buy groceries from Amazon, be entertained by Amazon shows, pick up snacks at Amazon Go stores, see all the ads they need on Amazon, find a plumber through Amazon, communicate through Amazon's Alexa virtual assistant — and that is just the beginning. Set against such ambition, the words ""second headquarters"" or, in Amazon parlance, ""HQ2,"" which proved so beguiling to the media, politicians and local governments ultimately mean little. ""The word 'headquarters' is a nontechnical, nonlegal term, but it plays well in the press to talk like this,"" Mr. O'Kelley said. ""It was a great P.R. move in all kinds of ways."" Qinghai Wang, a finance professor at the University of Central Florida who has studied corporate headquarters, agreed. ""Corporate headquarters, or at least the part that is central to decision-making, should be just in one place,"" he said. ""Boeing, another Seattle company that moved headquarters more than 10 years ago, only moved a few hundred people to Chicago. Amazon is a big company, and it has a very big headquarters already."" At least one expert realized some time ago how the game would end. ""Don't be surprised if later this year, Amazon announces that it's going to have more than one HQ2,"" the City Observatory, a think tank in Portland, Ore., said in an essay posted in January. One reason: ""If a single winner is announced, and its competitors are dismissed, then Amazon's negotiating position becomes much weaker,"" the essay said. Having multiple winners, on the other hand, would allow the company to play one off the other. Even as the news sank in on Monday, some people rued the lost chance that Amazon would do something truly transformative — not just for the company, but for its new home. ""Big tech is at a pivotal moment, and Amazon is at the head of the class,"" said Scott Phillips, an entrepreneur who submitted a proposal to build an enormous city for Amazon in rural Oklahoma. ""It is time for them to aggressively think not just about their bottom line but about ways they can do right by the world."" Washington and New York already have lots of tech talent, which of course explains why Amazon would move to those places. ""Amazon could have pulled a new region of the country onto the 'haves' list and pioneered much of the world's future in the process,"" Mr. Phillips lamented. In a way, the two-headquarters story was too good to be true even when Amazon proclaimed it bluntly and at length. ""Amazon HQ2 will be Amazon's second headquarters in North America,"" the company said in its promotional material. ""We expect to invest over $5 billion in construction and grow this second headquarters to include as many as 50,000 high-paying jobs — it will be a full equal to our current campus in Seattle."" Instead, while nothing official has been announced and things could shift at the last minute, it appears HQ2 will rank with the company's proclamation that drones would deliver packages. When the chief executive, Jeff Bezos, unveiled that initiative on ""60 Minutes,"" he said the drones would come in ""four, five years."" That was almost exactly five years ago. The drones have not taken flight, but many articles about them did. Amazon likewise gained enormous amounts of raw publicity from its search for a second headquarters. It gained something else as well. ""It's tempting to roll your eyes at this soap opera, but Amazon will walk away from this stunt with a cache of incredibly valuable data,"" said Stacy Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a frequent Amazon critic. ""It's learned all kinds of things from the bidding cities — like their future infrastructure plans — that even their citizens are not privy to."" Here's what's next, she said: ""Amazon will put this data to prodigious use in the coming years as it looks to expand its market power and sideline the competition."" Amazon is always expanding its market power. Consider a recent routine news release: ""Amazon Announces 14th Inland Empire Fulfillment Center in Beaumont,"" it said. Fulfillment center is a fancy term for warehouse. The Inland Empire is a vast area east of Los Angeles. To build 14 warehouses there in six years is a feat. Amazon said it was now the largest employer in the region. Amazon likes to release news on its own schedule. But the headquarters story leaked to outlets including The Washington Post — owned by Mr. Bezos — and The Wall Street Journal. It was a rare stumble for a company that excels at controlling the narrative. The real narrative, now and always with Amazon, is its ambition — sometimes veiled, sometimes overt, but never absent. The satirical site The Onion took the present to its logical extreme last month: ""After a search for a new location lasting more than a year, a massive dome was seen descending from the sky and enclosing the whole nation Friday as Amazon C.E.O. Jeff Bezos announced to a horrified American populace that it was now living inside his company's second headquarters."""
4,2018-11-06," Is Amazon ready for the New York City subway? In the neighborhood where the company reportedly wants to set up shop, the train routinely arrives full: cars packed so tightly with commuters rumbling into Long Island City from eastern Queens that waiting riders often have to watch several trains pass before they can get on. Now add up to 25,000 workers from Amazon. The influx would strain New York's delay-plagued system, which reached a crisis point last year with constant disruptions, a series of derailments and on-time performance that still hovers around 68 percent. It would put particular pressure on the 7 line, which stretches from the West Side of Manhattan into Queens and is the main artery into Long Island City. Yet Amazon is apparently undaunted. The company is nearing a deal to locate a major headquarters — one of two currently planned — in the sprawling, semi-industrial neighborhood, according to people briefed on the negotiations. The precise location in Long Island City has yet to be announced, and it is not clear whether the headquarters would be a single building or several. The company could also change direction and choose a different site all together. One person with knowledge of the discussions said Amazon executives were referring to the New York location as a ""campus."" [Was Amazon's headquarters contest a bait-and-switch? Critics say yes.] About 10 million square feet of potential office space was identified in the area, according to a second person briefed on the discussions. The people who spoke about the plans declined to be identified because the deal has not been publicly announced. ""New York, more than any other city in the country, can actually absorb something like this without it completely wiping it out,"" said Tom Wright, president of the Regional Plan Association, an urban research and advocacy group. ""We have more capacity than anywhere else."" But that does not mean there will not be challenges. The neighborhood, separated from Brooklyn to the south by the Newtown Creek, runs along the East River and is home to an expanding skyline that is crisscrossed by cranes and new construction. About 57,000 people live in the neighborhood, according to the city. The population is expected to rise sharply in the next two years, based on an analysis of new residential construction by the L.I.C. Partnership, a local business group. About 80,000 people work in the area, according to the city, at businesses that include JetBlue, Ralph Lauren and Silvercup Studios, where television shows and movies are shot. Uber and Lyft have offices in a building that also houses the Taxi and Limousine Commission. While most of the neighborhood's workers also live in Queens, about 8,500 travel from Long Island and roughly the same number commute from Manhattan. Aside from the 7 train, subway riders can access parts of the neighborhood via several other lines. One of those who commutes from Manhattan to Long Island City is Andrew Litavis, 27, who works at JetBlue and takes the W train. ""The upside is lots of open seats, but the downside is sometimes 10-minute gaps between trains at rush hour,"" Mr. Litavis said. The neighborhood also has two commuter ferry stops and numerous stations for the city's bike-share program, as well as two stops on the Long Island Rail Road. And there has long been discussion about adding another station in nearby Sunnyside. Jon Weinstein, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subway and the L.I.R.R., declined to comment about Amazon's plans or its impact on transportation. The company's anticipated arrival has jump-started some ambitious, albeit unlikely, ideas about how to improve the city's transit system. Mr. Wright of the Regional Plan Association pointed to the idea of extending a proposed new rail tunnel under the Hudson River from New Jersey, not just to Manhattan, but through the borough, under the East River and into Queens. That would link commuter rails in New Jersey and Long Island and extend the places where future employees of Amazon, or other businesses in Queens, could live and have a relatively tolerable commute. A new Amazon headquarters also sparked hope that Mayor Bill de Blasio's vision of a streetcar running along the waterfront between Brooklyn and Queens, known as the B.Q.X., could finally be realized. ""The campus would only reach its full potential with the B.Q.X.,"" said Jessica Schumer, executive director of the Friends of Brooklyn Queens Connector. But not everyone was ready to roll out a welcome mat. Community groups said Amazon should pay a gentrification tax to offset the anticipated effect of the new work force, whose annual salaries were expected to average $100,000, according to Amazon. State and local leaders ""should be extracting concessions that would benefit struggling residents in Queens,"" said Jonathan Westin of New York Communities for Change, which advocates low-income housing. Asked on Tuesday about the possibility of a deal, Mr. de Blasio summarized the argument made by city and state officials, even as he cautioned that Amazon had yet to make an official announcement. ""I can tell you that it's been a long detailed process in which the City of New York has tried to make very clear the reasons why this is a great place for a company to be because we have the talent base here,"" he told reporters. ""I mean, number one reason."" But Mr. de Blasio, whose administration has worked behind the scenes to encourage Amazon to relocate to the city, sought to distinguish himself from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who has been so publicly effusive about the company that he joked that he would call himself ""Amazon Cuomo"" if that is what it took to lure the company. ""Amazon de Blasio?"" a reporter called out as the mayor took questions in Brooklyn. ""No thanks,"" the mayor replied. As for the 7 train, it is in the process of being upgraded with modern signals — the second subway line to get new signals after the L train — that will allow more trains to run and ease the overcrowding. The new signal system, known as communications-based train control, is expected to be installed on the 7 line by the end of this year. The M.T.A. said it would be able to add two or three additional trains each hour — up from the current 27 trains per hour. Public transit has been one of New York's greatest selling points, but the city is at a crossroads as it decides whether to invest billions to modernize the system, said John Raskin, executive director of the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group. ""The 7 train has been particularly miserable while they've been doing construction,"" Mr. Raskin said, but once the new system is in place, ""it should be one of the city's best."""

In New York, The Tribune built a display of lights, alternating green and red with different numbers of white lights to signal each state's result. The paper first tried to send the display aloft on a kite, but the wind weakened, so the display was instead hung on the spire of the building. The World projected enormous bulletins over nearly its entire 20-story building across from City Hall, and The Herald shined a beacon from atop its building. At The Times, the new owner, Adolph Ochs, thought his paper's own efforts — projections on two screens in town — fell short. So when Mr. Ochs commissioned a new building in what would be renamed Times Square, he insisted that a searchlight be installed at the top. When the tower opened, just before the 1904 election, it was the city's second tallest. That night, and for election nights almost until the building was sold in 1961, a needle of light pointed out the winners.

6,2018-11-06," The prune capital of America. That was the future Silicon Valley's greatest claim to fame in the 1920s, when it was a sleepy landscape of fruit orchards and farms far removed from the nation's industrial might. Seattle was a city of fishing and timber, where a young entrepreneur named Bill Boeing had so few customers for his airplanes that he briefly pivoted to making furniture. The most innovative companies in the world clustered in the ferociously inventive cities of the East and Midwest — cars in Detroit; cash registers in Dayton, Ohio; light bulbs in Cleveland. The high-tech geography began to flip in the 1950s, as electronics and aerospace boomed. Before the Eisenhower era was over, cities across the country and across the globe had started racing to capture some of the West Coast's high-tech magic. Silicon Valley and Seattle are now a long way from biplanes and prunes. No surprise, then, that when Amazon's founder and C.E.O., Jeff Bezos, announced last fall that his company would build ""a full equal to our Seattle headquarters,"" 238 places bid to become HQ, including Detroit, Dayton and Cleveland. The 50,000 tech jobs promised by Amazon are well worth a city's spending millions in tax breaks and infrastructure. Amazon is now reportedly close to announcing a decision to divide the next headquarters between Long Island City, Queens, and Northern Virginia. So what can the new HQ2 city or cities learn from high-tech history? First and foremost: Yes, tech companies are a prize worth chasing. They offer jobs that are well-paying and productive, and attract a highly educated work force. Under the right conditions — the presence of strong research universities, access to capital and a quality of life that draws people in and keeps them there — a well-rooted tech community can seed several successive generations of companies, with the entrepreneurs of one era becoming mentors and investors and civic philanthropists in the next. This is what happened in Boston, in Silicon Valley and in Seattle, whose tech scene includes not only Amazon and Microsoft but also a wide variety of spinoff companies, as well as Facebook, Google, Alibaba and Baidu. Second: The new HQ2 will have to resolve a central paradox of the modern technology company. Silicon Valley and Seattle have both grown during an era of mass suburbanization. The technology firms they nurtured developed a preference for amenity-rich, self-contained corporate campuses, turning away from the older and more crowded cities where the high-tech industry had started: New York City, once home to Bell Labs; Philadelphia, the birthplace of the first all-digital computer. The most dramatic recent example is Apple's giant new glass-and-steel spaceship, which just landed in Cupertino, Calif. Now an increasing number of tech companies — Amazon among them — have chosen to locate or expand in the urban core. But the tech bubble has often come with them, resulting in self-contained environments with tight security, filled with free food and perks that keep workers at their desks rather than exploring the streets outside. San Francisco and Seattle were ill prepared for the tech wave that hit in the past decade. Current responses range from the promising but piecemeal (Amazon subsidizing additional city bus service in Seattle) to the impractical and divisive (San Francisco considering a ban on employee cafeterias in new office buildings to force tech workers to patronize local restaurants). Although tech companies and cities often find themselves fiercely opposed in these debates — most hotly in the recent attempt by Seattle to tax large employers like Amazon to pay for homeless services — there is some recognition on both sides that the current patterns are unsustainable. Growth challenges are already familiar ones in New York City and metropolitan Washington, D.C., where once-affordable neighborhoods have morphed into upmarket enclaves, and aging and overloaded transit systems create daily headaches for their millions of riders. Just as in San Francisco and Seattle, HQ2's arrival could make them far worse. This doesn't have to happen. HQ2 is an opportunity to do things differently. Amazon has an opportunity to forge a new approach, one where big tech is neither savior nor antagonist. Jeff Bezos and his leadership team can apply the strategic thinking that has made Amazon such an extraordinary company to the task of building a tech hub that encourages growth and widens opportunity.  This means breaking out of the bubble and redefining the corporate bottom line to include measures that reduce inequality, sustain existing small businesses and protect housing affordability, and, yes, even supporting cities in raising the tax revenue they need. This isn't an impossible dream. The secret of Silicon Valley wasn't tax breaks and cheap real estate; it was a postwar era of generous public spending on research and education, as well as on affordable housing and public infrastructure. These investments were designed to help everyone, but they were critical to helping tech flourish. No place or industry rules forever. Ask Detroit, once the most innovative place in America. The new capitals of tech should not take this prosperity for granted."
7,2018-11-06," SEATTLE — After conducting a yearlong search for a second home, Amazon has switched gears and is now finalizing plans to have a total of 50,000 employees in two locations, according to people familiar with the decision-making process. The company is nearing a deal to move to the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, according to two of the people briefed on the discussions. Amazon is also close to a deal to move to the Crystal City area of Arlington, Va., a Washington suburb, one of the people said. Amazon already has more employees in those two areas than anywhere else outside of Seattle, its home base, and the Bay Area. Amazon executives met two weeks ago with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in the governor's Manhattan office, said one of the people briefed on the process, adding that the state had offered potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies. Executives met separately with Mayor Bill de Blasio, a person briefed on that discussion said. Long Island City is a short subway ride across the East River from Midtown Manhattan. [Read more on the fast-growing Queens neighborhood of Long Island City could be doing to prepare for Amazon.] ""I am doing everything I can,"" Governor Cuomo told reporters when asked Monday about the state's efforts to lure the company. ""We have a great incentive package,"" he said. ""I'll change my name to Amazon Cuomo if that's what it takes,"" Governor Cuomo said. ""Because it would be a great economic boost."" The need to hire tens of thousands of high-tech workers has been the driving force behind the search, leading many to expect it to land in a major East Coast metropolitan area. Many experts have pointed to Crystal City as a front-runner, because of its strong public transit, educated work force and proximity to Washington. [Crystal City's upsides: good transit, diverse residents, a friendly business climate and a single developer with a big chunk of land.] JBG Smith, a developer who owns much of the land in Crystal City, declined to comment, as did Arlington County officials. Amazon declined to comment on whether it had made any final decisions. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported Amazon's decision to pick two new locations instead of one. About 1,800 people in advertising, fashion and publishing already work for Amazon in New York, and roughly 2,500 corporate and technical employees work in Northern Virginia and Washington. Amazon narrowed the list to 20 cities in January, and in recent weeks, smaller locations appeared to fall out of the running. For example, although Denver made the initial cut, Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado said last month, ""Wouldn't they rather have their second big hub on the East Coast?"" Amazon announced plans for a second headquarters in September 2017, saying that the company was growing faster than it could hire in its hometown Seattle. The company said it would invest more than $5 billion over almost two decades in a second headquarters, hiring as many as 50,000 full-time employees that would earn more than $100,000 a year on average. HQ2 would be ""full equal to our current campus in Seattle,"" the company said. If Amazon goes ahead with two new sites, it is unclear whether the company would refer to both of the locations as headquarters or if they would amount to large satellite offices. Picking multiple sites would allow it to tap into two pools of talented labor and perhaps avoid being blamed for all of the housing and traffic woes of dominating a single area. It could also give the company greater leverage in negotiating tax incentives, experts said. ""Even if the most obvious reasons appear to be about attracting more tech workers, the P.R. and government incentives benefits could help, too,"" said Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed, the online jobs site. With big presences in two cities, the local governments ""might feel pressure to increase the incentives they are offering Amazon, and the surprise is yet another news cycle for the Amazon headquarters process,"" he said. The HQ2 search sent states and cities into a frenzied bidding war. Some hired McKinsey & Company and other outside consultants to help them with their bids, investing heavily in courting Amazon and its promise of 50,000 jobs. Even half of that would amount to one of the largest corporate location deals, according to Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, which tracks corporate subsidies. ""These are very big numbers,"" he said. As Amazon's search dragged on, residents in many of 20 finalist cities worried about the impact such a massive project could have on housing and traffic, as well as what potential tax incentives could cost the community. The decision to split into two sites could alleviate some of that resistance. Seattle has been one of the fastest growing cities in the country, in part because of Amazon's growth. The company has about 45,000 employees in the city, and the company said it needed to hire more employees than the city could attract or absorb. ""Not everybody wants to live in the Northwest,"" Jeff Wilke, the head of Amazon's retail division, said at a conference last year. ""It's been terrific for me and my family, but I think we may find another location allows us to recruit a different collection of employees."" Amazon gave cities six weeks to pitch themselves in a public courtship. Almost 240 municipalities responded, trying to lure the tech giant with marketing gimmicks, promises of new transit lines and, as proposals trickled out, billions in tax incentives. The details of most bids are not public, to the frustration of even some lawmakers. A few elected officials from the short list of 20 cities signed what amounted to a mutual nonaggression pact, trying to avoid a bidding war that would give up too much from taxpayers. But mostly, cities continued their hard sell, showing Amazon executives around their proposed sites and trying to assure the company that the region had sufficient housing and transportation. Since wrapping up visits with cities in the spring, Amazon has been almost silent on the search. That led journalists, residents and politicians to look for clues in new job postings and the flight path of the corporate jet used by Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive. To meet its own deadlines, Amazon will need to move fast. It had said it wanted 500,000 square feet of office space — enough for thousands of employees — available for use next year. Jay Brodsky, who lives in Arlington, Va., said about a week ago that his wife took part in a 45-minute phone survey about her opinion if Amazon moved to the area. ""It was everything from, 'What do you think about the local government,' to 'Are you concerned about traffic?'"" he said. She received an Amazon gift card for participating. ""People are sort of on pins and needles,"" Mr. Brodsky said. ""It's almost like people want it to happen, and are afraid of what would happen if it does."""
8,2018-11-06," SAN FRANCISCO — What a farce. That was one of the immediate reactions when word leaked out on Monday that Amazon's much-ballyhooed search for a second headquarters outside of Seattle would result in not one, but two new locations. On Twitter, people used farce, sham or stunt to describe what had happened. Amazon's critics were apoplectic at what they called a bait-and-switch. ""I was shocked,"" said Robert B. Engel of the Free & Fair Markets Initiative, a nonprofit that is a determined foe of the retailer on all fronts. ""They've duped more than the bidders. They've duped all of us. They can't even live up to a promise that wasn't fair to anyone but Amazon."" From the company's point of view, however, things seem to be working out rather nicely. The quest kept a persistent spotlight on Amazon as the suitor everyone sought — would it choose Denver? maybe Atlanta? surely Chicago? — even as the company apparently decided instead to set up smaller operations in the Washington metro area and in New York City, the two most obvious places all along. (Amazon declined to comment.) Amid the guessing game, the company got information from dozens of cities about how much they would pay for a strong Amazon presence, valuable data that it will no doubt use to expand. ""What we see is Amazon evolving into a corporation whose headquarters is virtual and whose physical presence will span the globe,"" said Charles R. T. O'Kelley, director of the Berle Center on Corporations, Law and Society at Seattle University. ""Instead of being headquartered in one place and moving to a second headquarters, Amazon is going to be, and be thought of as, everywhere."" This, after all, is how Amazon sees its destiny: to become not just the everything store, as it was branded a mere five years ago, but the everything company. People will buy groceries from Amazon, be entertained by Amazon shows, pick up snacks at Amazon Go stores, see all the ads they need on Amazon, find a plumber through Amazon, communicate through Amazon's Alexa virtual assistant — and that is just the beginning. Set against such ambition, the words ""second headquarters"" or, in Amazon parlance, ""HQ2,"" which proved so beguiling to the media, politicians and local governments ultimately mean little. ""The word 'headquarters' is a nontechnical, nonlegal term, but it plays well in the press to talk like this,"" Mr. O'Kelley said. ""It was a great P.R. move in all kinds of ways."" Qinghai Wang, a finance professor at the University of Central Florida who has studied corporate headquarters, agreed. ""Corporate headquarters, or at least the part that is central to decision-making, should be just in one place,"" he said. ""Boeing, another Seattle company that moved headquarters more than 10 years ago, only moved a few hundred people to Chicago. Amazon is a big company, and it has a very big headquarters already."" At least one expert realized some time ago how the game would end. ""Don't be surprised if later this year, Amazon announces that it's going to have more than one HQ2,"" the City Observatory, a think tank in Portland, Ore., said in an essay posted in January. One reason: ""If a single winner is announced, and its competitors are dismissed, then Amazon's negotiating position becomes much weaker,"" the essay said. Having multiple winners, on the other hand, would allow the company to play one off the other. Even as the news sank in on Monday, some people rued the lost chance that Amazon would do something truly transformative — not just for the company, but for its new home. ""Big tech is at a pivotal moment, and Amazon is at the head of the class,"" said Scott Phillips, an entrepreneur who submitted a proposal to build an enormous city for Amazon in rural Oklahoma. ""It is time for them to aggressively think not just about their bottom line but about ways they can do right by the world."" Washington and New York already have lots of tech talent, which of course explains why Amazon would move to those places. ""Amazon could have pulled a new region of the country onto the 'haves' list and pioneered much of the world's future in the process,"" Mr. Phillips lamented. In a way, the two-headquarters story was too good to be true even when Amazon proclaimed it bluntly and at length. ""Amazon HQ2 will be Amazon's second headquarters in North America,"" the company said in its promotional material. ""We expect to invest over $5 billion in construction and grow this second headquarters to include as many as 50,000 high-paying jobs — it will be a full equal to our current campus in Seattle."" Instead, while nothing official has been announced and things could shift at the last minute, it appears HQ2 will rank with the company's proclamation that drones would deliver packages. When the chief executive, Jeff Bezos, unveiled that initiative on ""60 Minutes,"" he said the drones would come in ""four, five years."" That was almost exactly five years ago. The drones have not taken flight, but many articles about them did. Amazon likewise gained enormous amounts of raw publicity from its search for a second headquarters. It gained something else as well. ""It's tempting to roll your eyes at this soap opera, but Amazon will walk away from this stunt with a cache of incredibly valuable data,"" said Stacy Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a frequent Amazon critic. ""It's learned all kinds of things from the bidding cities — like their future infrastructure plans — that even their citizens are not privy to."" Here's what's next, she said: ""Amazon will put this data to prodigious use in the coming years as it looks to expand its market power and sideline the competition."" Amazon is always expanding its market power. Consider a recent routine news release: ""Amazon Announces 14th Inland Empire Fulfillment Center in Beaumont,"" it said. Fulfillment center is a fancy term for warehouse. The Inland Empire is a vast area east of Los Angeles. To build 14 warehouses there in six years is a feat. Amazon said it was now the largest employer in the region. Amazon likes to release news on its own schedule. But the headquarters story leaked to outlets including The Washington Post — owned by Mr. Bezos — and The Wall Street Journal. It was a rare stumble for a company that excels at controlling the narrative. The real narrative, now and always with Amazon, is its ambition — sometimes veiled, sometimes overt, but never absent. The satirical site The Onion took the present to its logical extreme last month: ""After a search for a new location lasting more than a year, a massive dome was seen descending from the sky and enclosing the whole nation Friday as Amazon C.E.O. Jeff Bezos announced to a horrified American populace that it was now living inside his company's second headquarters."""
9,2018-11-06," Is Amazon ready for the New York City subway? In the neighborhood where the company reportedly wants to set up shop, the train routinely arrives full: cars packed so tightly with commuters rumbling into Long Island City from eastern Queens that waiting riders often have to watch several trains pass before they can get on. Now add up to 25,000 workers from Amazon. The influx would strain New York's delay-plagued system, which reached a crisis point last year with constant disruptions, a series of derailments and on-time performance that still hovers around 68 percent. It would put particular pressure on the 7 line, which stretches from the West Side of Manhattan into Queens and is the main artery into Long Island City. Yet Amazon is apparently undaunted. The company is nearing a deal to locate a major headquarters — one of two currently planned — in the sprawling, semi-industrial neighborhood, according to people briefed on the negotiations. The precise location in Long Island City has yet to be announced, and it is not clear whether the headquarters would be a single building or several. The company could also change direction and choose a different site all together. One person with knowledge of the discussions said Amazon executives were referring to the New York location as a ""campus."" [Was Amazon's headquarters contest a bait-and-switch? Critics say yes.] About 10 million square feet of potential office space was identified in the area, according to a second person briefed on the discussions. The people who spoke about the plans declined to be identified because the deal has not been publicly announced. ""New York, more than any other city in the country, can actually absorb something like this without it completely wiping it out,"" said Tom Wright, president of the Regional Plan Association, an urban research and advocacy group. ""We have more capacity than anywhere else."" But that does not mean there will not be challenges. The neighborhood, separated from Brooklyn to the south by the Newtown Creek, runs along the East River and is home to an expanding skyline that is crisscrossed by cranes and new construction. About 57,000 people live in the neighborhood, according to the city. The population is expected to rise sharply in the next two years, based on an analysis of new residential construction by the L.I.C. Partnership, a local business group. About 80,000 people work in the area, according to the city, at businesses that include JetBlue, Ralph Lauren and Silvercup Studios, where television shows and movies are shot. Uber and Lyft have offices in a building that also houses the Taxi and Limousine Commission. While most of the neighborhood's workers also live in Queens, about 8,500 travel from Long Island and roughly the same number commute from Manhattan. Aside from the 7 train, subway riders can access parts of the neighborhood via several other lines. One of those who commutes from Manhattan to Long Island City is Andrew Litavis, 27, who works at JetBlue and takes the W train. ""The upside is lots of open seats, but the downside is sometimes 10-minute gaps between trains at rush hour,"" Mr. Litavis said. The neighborhood also has two commuter ferry stops and numerous stations for the city's bike-share program, as well as two stops on the Long Island Rail Road. And there has long been discussion about adding another station in nearby Sunnyside. Jon Weinstein, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subway and the L.I.R.R., declined to comment about Amazon's plans or its impact on transportation. The company's anticipated arrival has jump-started some ambitious, albeit unlikely, ideas about how to improve the city's transit system. Mr. Wright of the Regional Plan Association pointed to the idea of extending a proposed new rail tunnel under the Hudson River from New Jersey, not just to Manhattan, but through the borough, under the East River and into Queens. That would link commuter rails in New Jersey and Long Island and extend the places where future employees of Amazon, or other businesses in Queens, could live and have a relatively tolerable commute. A new Amazon headquarters also sparked hope that Mayor Bill de Blasio's vision of a streetcar running along the waterfront between Brooklyn and Queens, known as the B.Q.X., could finally be realized. ""The campus would only reach its full potential with the B.Q.X.,"" said Jessica Schumer, executive director of the Friends of Brooklyn Queens Connector. But not everyone was ready to roll out a welcome mat. Community groups said Amazon should pay a gentrification tax to offset the anticipated effect of the new work force, whose annual salaries were expected to average $100,000, according to Amazon. State and local leaders ""should be extracting concessions that would benefit struggling residents in Queens,"" said Jonathan Westin of New York Communities for Change, which advocates low-income housing. Asked on Tuesday about the possibility of a deal, Mr. de Blasio summarized the argument made by city and state officials, even as he cautioned that Amazon had yet to make an official announcement. ""I can tell you that it's been a long detailed process in which the City of New York has tried to make very clear the reasons why this is a great place for a company to be because we have the talent base here,"" he told reporters. ""I mean, number one reason."" But Mr. de Blasio, whose administration has worked behind the scenes to encourage Amazon to relocate to the city, sought to distinguish himself from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who has been so publicly effusive about the company that he joked that he would call himself ""Amazon Cuomo"" if that is what it took to lure the company. ""Amazon de Blasio?"" a reporter called out as the mayor took questions in Brooklyn. ""No thanks,"" the mayor replied. As for the 7 train, it is in the process of being upgraded with modern signals — the second subway line to get new signals after the L train — that will allow more trains to run and ease the overcrowding. The new signal system, known as communications-based train control, is expected to be installed on the 7 line by the end of this year. The M.T.A. said it would be able to add two or three additional trains each hour — up from the current 27 trains per hour. Public transit has been one of New York's greatest selling points, but the city is at a crossroads as it decides whether to invest billions to modernize the system, said John Raskin, executive director of the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group. ""The 7 train has been particularly miserable while they've been doing construction,"" Mr. Raskin said, but once the new system is in place, ""it should be one of the city's best."""
10,2018-11-06," The new Amazon drama ""Homecoming"" has a lot going for it. Julia Roberts in her first starring TV role. Bravura directing from Sam Esmail of ""Mr. Robot."" A top-notch supporting cast, taut writing and a mind-bending military-corporate thriller plot. I wrote about all these things in my review. But to be honest, what most excited me when I first started watching the screeners was that every episode is about 30 minutes long. With today's expansive TV drama installments typically running an hour (or more), each episode of ""Homecoming"" felt like a gift certificate for 30 extra minutes of sweet, unencumbered life. Thirty more minutes to work, to sleep or — why not? — watch a second episode. They were no less captivating for being short. They may have even been better. Somewhere in its history, TV formalized the idea that drama is a marathon and comedy a sprint. Network schedules established sitcoms at 30 minutes, with commercials; dramas — with early exceptions like most seasons of ""The Twilight Zone"" — settled in at 60. A rigid scheduling grid is less important in cable; in streaming, not at all. This freedom has had, for drama, the effect of loosening one's belt for Thanksgiving dinner. Cable dramas like ""Game of Thrones"" often exceed sixty minutes without ads, and streaming series like ""The Romanoffs"" ungirdle themselves to feature length. So it's been a welcome counter-trend to see dramas doing more with less. ""The Girlfriend Experience,"" ""Vida,"" ""Mr. In-Between,"" ""Room 104"" and others have clocked in at around a half-hour. Other series, like ""Maniac"" and ""The OA,"" intersperse longer episodes with quickies. Only a hypocrite would praise the short installment at great length. So I'll be brief. First, short dramas are just practical. One could argue that only a TV critic frets about episode length: It's a first-world problem in a first-world job. But look, I'm paid to do this. I've got plenty of time. People with actual productive jobs, on the other hand, have ever more TV to fit in their limited free time. Epic drama means greater investment: You have to put in six or eight hours to get to the point where, your friends swear to you, ""Ozark"" really gets good. (It doesn't. Saved you a day.) Short dramas, on the other hand, reward sampling. ""Sweetbitter,"" on Starz, was too slight and bland for me, but I appreciated that I could gauge that quickly and move on. Short dramas are economical. Longer series have to serve a bigger roster of characters, spinning off subplots for each. ""This Is Us"" is an hour; the portion I want to follow any given week is maybe 20 minutes. [Read about how ""Homecoming"" made the leap from podcast to screen.] Cutting the running time in half focuses the gaze. Facebook Watch's quiet gem ""Sorry for Your Loss,"" like ""This Is Us,"" is about the aftereffects of a premature death on a spouse and family. And it's only about that. It does that one thing well, which makes for an intense focus on Elizabeth Olsen's Leigh, her grief, rage and progress. It's like ""This Is Us,"" the high-strength concentrate. ""Homecoming,"" likewise, has two timelines but one story. There isn't A, B, C and D plot, nor should there be; it would distract from the thriller's stage-like technique of building suspense through conversation. The half-hour drama also reflects where the real creative energy is in TV today. Some of the best work is happening in half-hour hybrids — ""Transparent,"" ""Better Things,"" ""Atlanta"" and ""Barry,"" to name a few — that are ""comedies"" for awards purposes but half drama, or more, in substance. Then there's rhythm and velocity. Bingeing a lengthy drama can feel like sinking into quicksand; I'm not so much absorbing the story as it absorbs me. I start to feel like my immobility itself is the product: my butt on a couch, adding hours logged to some clicking meter in a media company's accounting office. When a series like Netflix's pharmacological head trip ""Maniac"" switches up with a 26-minute episode, it underlines the sense of play and unpredictability in the storytelling itself. It's bracing; it's a changeup; it's narrative syncopation. Of course, neither is ""shorter is better"" an absolute rule. Wasted time is the problem rather than time itself, and there is certainly value to series like ""Better Call Saul"" that take advantage of the silent frame and the extended pause, allowing momentum to build and detail to accrete in such a way that, though their episodes might run past the usual length, they appear to fly by in a fraction of the usual time. But since when does length equal seriousness? ""The Great Gatsby""? ""The Metamorphosis""? ""Mrs. Dalloway""? Short, short, short! Pithiness is power. I'd say more, but I have screeners to watch. At heart, TV's time crunch is a tribute to how the medium has become worth our time. All the more reason to appreciate the shows that recognize that we don't have all the time in the world."
11,2018-11-06," New York City last week announced $180 million in new spending on Long Island City to bolster transit, fix the sewer system and attract new, good-paying jobs. Now it appears that spending was, in part, deliberately timed. Amazon is nearing a deal to name Long Island City, a fast-growing neighborhood on the western edge of Queens, as one of two locations that would together house as many as 50,000 employees in its ever-expanding work force, according to two people briefed on the negotiations. The other location in Amazon's plans is outside the Crystal City area of Arlington, Va., a Washington suburb, according to one of the people briefed. [Read more about how Amazon is nearing a deal to locate a headquarters in Queens.] The arrival of Amazon in Long Island City could finally establish New York as a major technology hub. But some residents worry about the effects of so many newcomers on the neighborhood of gleaming apartment towers and low-rise manufacturing that is already straining from rapid growth. The neighborhood has seen a swift rise in new building that began with a single high-rise office tower, opened in 1990 and belonging to Citigroup. If the name Long Island City once seemed aspirational, in recent years it has been more descriptive: Apartment towers now dot the skyline, crowding around the elevated No. 7 subway train. There have been 41 new apartment buildings built there since 2010, according to an analysis by the city. Last year, more new apartments were built in Long Island City than in any other neighborhood in New York. The reasons, in large measure, are its proximity to Manhattan, its relatively low cost and the views. ""You can almost reach out from Hunters Point Park and feel like you're going to touch 34th Street in Manhattan,"" the local councilman, Jimmy Van Bramer, said of the proximity to Midtown Manhattan. There is also a collection of amenities tailor-made for technology employees: the MoMA PS1 contemporary art center, several breweries and a place where you can learn trapeze. The northern part of the neighborhood is also home to the Queensbridge Houses, the largest public housing project in the country. The proposed locations of any Amazon buildings within the neighborhood were not clear. A person briefed on the discussions said city officials took Amazon executives looking for a new headquarters, known as HQ2, around the area three times, in April, July and September. In one instance, the person said, they toured on Citi Bikes, the local bike-share program; in another, they took a sunset ride on one of the city's new fast ferries. ""Whether it's Amazon or something else, we're growing,"" said Elizabeth Lusskin, president of the LIC Partnership, the local development corporation. ""You do have to plan thoughtfully."" All the building — and the new residents who come with it — has put pressure on the area's infrastructure. New schools are needed, according to the city, and the subways are packed. ""The 7 train is overloaded today, and we can't sell Long Island City as being transportation rich,"" Mr. Van Bramer said, sounding a note of caution. ""The people who work at Amazon are going to be competing for space on that train."" It was not clear whether the discussions with Amazon included promises to improve or expand transit options. The office of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo declined to comment on the company's plans, which have yet to be formally announced. A spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio also declined to comment. Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio met separately with Amazon executives late last month, according to two people familiar with the discussions. But the city's new spending plan, released last Tuesday, included one possibility for increasing transportation options that could involve a new train stop in the heart of the area. ""Work with M.T.A./L.I.R.R. and Amtrak to study the feasibility of creating a new rail station in Sunnyside Yard at Queens Boulevard,"" read the city's plan, referring to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Long Island Rail Road, both of which use space in nearby rail yards. A person briefed on the discussions said that while the plan had been in the works before, city officials wanted to be sure to release it before Amazon made a decision. Members of the local community board said they were worried about the effects an Amazon headquarters could have on cultural institutions, surrounding manufacturing operations and other local businesses, already under pressure from rising land costs. ""There was grumbling before,"" said Sheila Lewandowski, 54, a longtime resident and director of the Chocolate Factory Theater, an arts organization in the area that has faced the threat of displacement. And then, she added, there is the issue of the sewers. Half of the city's proposed new spending, about $95 million, is for sewers. ""We do have sewage problems,"" Ms. Lewandowski said. ""They're backing up. If we're going to bring in this major corporation, we better invest a lot more in infrastructure."""
12,2018-11-06," (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good evening. Here's the latest. 1. Our first order of business: Election results. Democrats were on track to capture control of the House of Representatives, while Republicans were positioned to add to their majority in the Senate. As expected, Democrats won a series of governors races, flipping seats in Illinois and Michigan. There were winding lines at many polling places across the country, and unpleasant weather conditions in some areas, but voters turned out in large numbers for a midterm election. Above, in Brooklyn. Our live briefing has the latest. We've removed our paywall for the elections. Register or log in to nytimes.com for unlimited access to the entire site. _____ 2. In Georgia's race for governor, the Republican candidate, Brian Kemp, had a strong lead over the Democrat, Stacey Abrams. Georgia was one of the states reporting technical glitches, along with Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Arizona. Above, voters with paper ballots in Duluth, Ga. ""We've got people who are voting with the paper ballots, and we've got people who are standing to wait for the machines to be fixed, and we've got people who said they are planning to come back,"" an election official in Georgia said. _____ 3. President Trump had no public events for the day. The mood inside the White House was gloomy, according to aides and people in contact with the president. His advisers' warnings — that that the losses could be brutal in House and statehouse races, but that the Senate should be a bright spot — appear to have been on target. On the Democratic side, Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, above, predicted sweeping House gains — and warned that Mr. Trump might challenge the legitimacy of votes that went against his party. _____ Now let's catch up on the other things that happened today. 4. Fighting in Yemen has intensified sharply, threatening to plunge the country deeper into war, cholera and famine. In the embattled Red Sea port of Hudaydah, the United Arab Emirates, part of a Saudi-led coalition that has been backed by the U.S., launched airstrikes against the rebel Houthis. Shipments of grain and other elements of humanitarian aid are in peril. Above, Yemeni forces. The surge may stem from a Saudi desire to score territorial gains before the peace talks being urged by the U.S. and Britain. _____ 5. More than 200 mass graves holding as many as 12,000 bodies have been discovered in Iraq. The U.N. said they were the work of Islamic State militants, who controlled parts of the country from 2014 to 2017, and were part of systematic and widespread violence that ""may amount to war crimes, crimes against humanity, and possible genocide."" Above, a search for remains. The months-old, American-backed offensive to drive ISIS from Syria has been hindered by booby traps, land mines and a militant counterattack during a fierce sandstorm. _____ 6. Facebook acknowledged that its platform was used to ""foment division and incite offline violence"" in Myanmar where the military unleashed an online campaign targeting the Rohingya Muslim minority that led to murder, rape and forced migration. ""We agree that we can and should do more,"" said one of the company's executives, who disclosed details of a critical human rights report commissioned by the company. Above, Rohingya refugees fleeing to Bangladesh last year. Facebook detractors slammed the company for releasing the report at a time when public attention is focused on the midterm elections. _____ 7. A man-eating tigress believed to have killed at least 13 Indian villagers over the last two years was recently killed. But local relief has rapidly been overwhelmed by a national backlash. Politicians and animal rights advocates have denounced the failure to capture rather than kill, and a government official threatened legal action against those responsible. India's establishment of reserves to protect its critically endangered tiger population has worked — meaning bloody confrontations with people have risen. Above, two cubs in a reserve. ""We have to think of a mechanism of coexistence,"" a researcher said. _____ 8. Amazon is finalizing plans to split its second headquarters between Long Island City in Queens, N.Y., and Arlington, Va., above, according to people familiar with the decision-making process. The company itself isn't commenting — just yet. The company's 14-month search set off a frenzied bidding war, with states and cities vying for Amazon's promise of 50,000 jobs. And it appears to be ending with the two most obvious locations, where the company already has more workers than anywhere outside of Seattle, its home base, and the Bay Area. Critics furiously denounced Amazon for a bait and switch to wring more concessions from pre-ordained choices. But, our technology reporter writes, the strategy allowed the company to gather valuable information for future expansion. _____ 9. The consequences of the Google walkout last week could reverberate across the entire tech sector. Our reporter covering workplace issues notes that the workers who joined the protest engaged in the kind of solidarity almost unheard-of in the libertarian world of techies. But the issues they were addressing — the company's controversial work with the Pentagon on artificial intelligence, its apparent willingness to build a censored search engine for China and above all its handling of sexual harassment accusations against senior managers — were just too big for solo action. Above, in Manhattan. ""The myth of Silicon Valley is that all the power you need is embodied in you as an individual,"" a labor expert told us. ""What they were saying here was that all the economic power they had as individuals wasn't enough."" _____ 10. Finally, if the latest news cycle has you wanting to send your thoughts to far-off destinations, we can suggest a few. Lose yourself in Tiny Love Stories, five reader-submitted epics told in under 100 words. Relax with a CBD cocktail at a Queens spot claiming to be the first in New York City to serve food and drinks infused with cannabidiol (that's marijuana's nonpsychotropic cousin). Or just sit still and breathe. Pop in some earbuds and spend a quiet moment scrolling through The Calm Place, our new oasis of peace that comes with an emotional support dog.

0,2018-11-07," SAN FRANCISCO — A worldwide strike by antiquarian booksellers against an Amazon subsidiary proved successful after two days, with the retailer apologizing and saying it would cancel the actions that prompted the protest. It was a rare concerted uprising against any part of Amazon by any of its millions of suppliers, leading to an even rarer capitulation. Even the book dealers said they were surprised at the sudden reversal by AbeBooks, the company's secondhand and rare bookselling network. The uprising, which involved nearly 600 booksellers in 27 countries removing about four million books, was set off by the retailer's decision to cut off stores in five countries: the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, South Korea and Russia. AbeBooks never explained its actions beyond saying it was related to payment processing. ""AbeBooks was saying entire countries were expendable to its plans,"" said Scott Brown, a Eureka, Calif., bookseller who was an organizer of the strike. ""Booksellers everywhere felt they might be next."" The matter was apparently resolved when Sally Burdon, an Australian bookseller who is president of the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers, spoke with Arkady Vitrouk, chief executive of AbeBooks. In a Wednesday email to her members after their talk, Ms. Burdon said Mr. Vitrouk apologized for the platform's behavior ""a number of times"" and said booksellers in the affected countries would not be dropped as scheduled on Nov. 30. ""Arkady told us that ABE are very well aware of the mistake they have made,"" she wrote in the email, which was viewed by The New York Times. ""He stated that it was a 'bad decision' and that they deeply regret the hurt and harm they have caused."" Richard Davies, a spokesman for AbeBooks, which is based in British Columbia, declined to comment on Ms. Burdon's email. He provided a cryptic statement saying, ""We are putting together a solution."" The spark for the strike, designated Banned Booksellers Week, was less what AbeBooks did than how it did it. It provided explanations slowly and reluctantly, irritating booksellers who felt they were all being treated in cavalier fashion. Antiquarian bookselling is a close-knit community, with the official motto of the international association being Amor librorum nos unit — love of books unites us all. ""I would not have thought that we'll succeed, but you showed the real meaning of our motto,"" Adam Bosze, the president of the Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of Hungary, wrote in a message to his foreign colleagues on Wednesday. Vic Zoschak, president of the Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America, was optimistic on the sudden resolution. ""I choose to believe yesterday's dialogue between the two camps will be but a start to improved communications and relations, each dedicated to a continued win-win association,"" he said. Experts in selling on Amazon said that such parity was difficult to achieve. ""I don't think anything like this has ever happened before with any part of Amazon,"" said Juozas Kaziukenas, chief executive of Marketplace Pulse, an e-commerce analytics firm. ""It would be much harder to have a strike on Amazon itself, just because there are so many sellers there and they are not part of an organized community."" He added, ""Whoever owns the platform owns the power. As a seller you are a small module in a massively complicated system. If a thousand of you say you will not do something anymore, 2,000 others will replace you. This is the harsh reality of being a seller."" For Mr. Brown of Eureka Books, the lesson of Banned Booksellers Week was clear. ""We are entirely subject to their whims,"" he said of Amazon. ""We need to spend more time focusing our energies on our own business outside of the Amazon ecosphere."" There was recently an effort to organize Amazon sellers as a trade association called the Online Merchants Guild. It was largely focused on sales tax issues, but the group said on its website that ""the sky's the limit in terms of how we can leverage our collective strength to improve the quality of life for all members."" If nothing else, Banned Booksellers Week was the sort of public relations stumble for Amazon that seems a bit more common than it once was. The company thrives on secrecy, preferring to release minimal information. It began as a bookseller and is now the largest in the world, controlling more of the market than any bookseller has ever done, and yet the number of serious books about Amazon itself could be counted on the fingers of one hand. But as the company expands into doing everything everywhere, an iron grip is harder. Case in point was the recent news that leaked out that Northern Virginia was likely to be a spot for a new Amazon headquarters. That prompted Mike Grella, Amazon's director of economic development, to lash out on Twitter last week. ""Memo to the genius leaking info about Crystal City, VA as #HQ2 selection. You're not doing Crystal City, VA any favors,"" he wrote. ""And stop treating the NDA you signed like a used napkin."""
1,2018-11-07," When Amazon announced plans to build a second headquarters somewhere in North America, it set off a competition for a sort of new-economy golden ticket, a chance for one city to become, almost overnight, a magnet for the high-paying jobs and entrepreneurial spark that are hallmarks of urban success in the 21st century. Critics were just as quick to highlight potential downsides: soaring housing costs, clogged roads and strained public resources. A year later, Amazon appears poised to transform two communities, not just one. But the central question — will that transformation be for the good or the bad? — has not changed. Economists, urban planners and other experts say the answer could hinge on decisions in the coming months by the company and by the state and local officials who worked so hard to woo it. ""This is not about a one-time deal,"" said Amy Liu, director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. ""This is about whether Amazon and these winning communities are going to create a long-term partnership to minimize the negative impact of supersonic growth."" Amazon may have made that job a bit easier. Splitting the project, known as HQ2, between two cities should ease the pressure on housing and infrastructure that critics have feared. And the company seems to have zeroed in on places able to handle an influx of workers. Amazon's list of 20 finalists, announced in January, included midsize cities like Indianapolis, Nashville and Columbus, Ohio, that many experts said might struggle to absorb what was then expected to be about 50,000 jobs. But Amazon is reportedly completing plans for sites in New York City and the Washington area, megalopolises with multiple airports, extensive if strained public transit systems and elite universities. The likely locations — Long Island City, a neighborhood in Queens, and Crystal City, a part of Arlington, Va. — are outside their regions' central business districts and have room for development. And while Washington and New York rank among the country's most expensive housing markets, both have experienced a recent boom in apartment construction, and rents there have fallen slightly over the past year, according to data from the real estate site Zillow. Even the full, undivided HQ2 project would have pushed up rents less than 1 percent per year in New York and Washington, according to an analysis performed by Zillow this year. ""Those two markets were in the leading edge of rental slowdowns,"" said Aaron Terrazas, a Zillow economist. ""There is definitely a lot more supply in those markets than there was in Seattle a decade ago."" The specter of Seattle has loomed over the HQ2 debate. Its economy has boomed since Amazon moved into the South Lake Union neighborhood in 2007. But many residents complain that growth has come at the cost of affordability and livability. Although Amazon has never said so explicitly, its tense relationship with its native city may have contributed to its decision to search for a second home. In New York and Virginia, Amazon has a chance for a fresh start. And those places have an opportunity to learn from Seattle's mistakes. ""When Amazon moved into its South Lake Union headquarters, no one knew that it was going to become the global phenomenon that it is today,"" Mr. Terrazas said. ""In Seattle there was a lot of catch-up in housing development, catch-up in infrastructure."" New York and Virginia, by contrast, can start planning immediately to build housing, expand infrastructure and improve transit systems. If they do, Amazon could be the nudge that regions needed to address longstanding challenges, said Sarah Rosen Wartell, president of the Urban Institute, a Washington-based think tank. ""There is a way that something like this focuses the mind,"" Ms. Wartell said. ""Amazon or no Amazon, all of our major housing markets and communities that are thriving are dealing with the consequences of growth."" The key is ensuring that policies benefit all residents, not just highly paid tech workers that Amazon will employ directly, Ms. Wartell said. That means building housing for low- and middle-income families, not just luxury condominiums, and improving transit options in poorer neighborhoods. Critics are skeptical of that prospect. Lauren Jacobs, executive director of the Partnership for Working Families, a network of local advocacy organizations, said Amazon should make specific promises to train and hire workers locally, rather than just bringing them in from out of town. ""Many of our neighbors are still struggling in this economy, and this could be an amazing transformational thing to have 25,000 jobs come to the community,"" she said. ""But we have to ensure we don't see another wave of mass displacement of working-class residents."" Some of the HQ2 finalists promised enormous tax incentives to try to lure Amazon to their cities — a strategy criticized by many economists, who say such deals rarely pay off. It isn't yet clear what subsidies Virginia and New York offered Amazon, but there are signs the project didn't come cheap. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said Monday that the state had offered ""a great incentive package,"" and quipped that he would change his name to ""Amazon Cuomo if that's what it takes"" to land the deal. Timothy J. Bartik, an economist for the Upjohn Institute in Kalamazoo, Mich., who has studied tax incentives, said comments such as Mr. Cuomo's were concerning. He and other economists worry about a ""race to the bottom,"" where state and local governments compete to offer ever-bigger subsidies. In one case, Wisconsin offered billions of dollars in incentives to attract a manufacturing plant from Foxconn, a Taiwan-based technology company. Since the project was announced last year, the price tag has grown, while the number of jobs has not. Mr. Bartik estimated this year that Wisconsin was paying more than eight times as much per job for the project as it did in earlier deals. ""It's easy to hand out cash, and it's especially easy to hand out cash if it's going to be the next governor's problem,"" Mr. Bartik said. But not all incentives are created equal, he noted. Efforts to streamline regulatory and permitting processes, for example, can make projects more attractive to companies without costing taxpayers much if anything. And investments in infrastructure or job training can reap benefits for the community even if they are initially promised as a way to help a specific company. ""I would be trying to leverage this into improvements that wouldn't just benefit Amazon but benefit you more broadly,"" Mr. Bartik said. Boosters of the Amazon project hope for even more transformational results. In the late 1990s, for example, Alabama offered large tax incentives to attract a factory from Mercedes-Benz, and South Carolina did the same with BMW. Those deals helped create vibrant automaking industries that employ thousands and have helped lift regional economies. In some counties in the region, one in 10 workers is employed in the auto industry. New York and Washington, of course, are a far cry from the rural Southeast. And white-collar tech jobs at Amazon require different skills than the factory jobs created by Mercedes and BMW. But Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics, pointed to parallels. Amazon and other technology companies employ not just hotshot graduates of Stanford and Caltech but also thousands of lower-level programmers, data analysts and other workers who have technical skills but not advanced degrees. Amazon's decision could change the pecking order among technology hubs, in which New York and Washington have lagged behind San Francisco, Seattle and Boston. ""I think it does set these cities up to be rivals to Silicon Valley a generation or two down the road,"" Mr. Zandi said. ""It could be the catalyst."" Amazon's arrival will also mean more demand for the pool of tech workers in New York and Washington. That worries some start-ups, who already compete with Google, Facebook and other giants that have set up offices there. But Sam Mandel, senior vice president at Betaworks, a company that develops and invests in start-ups, said Amazon would be a net benefit for the tech sector. ""There will be more people leaving Amazon and wanting to do earlier stage start-ups than there will be people leaving start-ups to go work at Amazon,"" Mr. Mandel said."

Amazon and other technology companies employ not just hotshot graduates of Stanford and Caltech but also thousands of lower-level programmers, data analysts and other workers who have technical skills but not advanced degrees. Amazon's decision could change the pecking order among technology hubs, in which New York and Washington have lagged behind San Francisco, Seattle and Boston. ""I think it does set these cities up to be rivals to Silicon Valley a generation or two down the road,"" Mr. Zandi said. ""It could be the catalyst."" Amazon's arrival will also mean more demand for the pool of tech workers in New York and Washington. That worries some start-ups, who already compete with Google, Facebook and other giants that have set up offices there. But Sam Mandel, senior vice president at Betaworks, a company that develops and invests in start-ups, said Amazon would be a net benefit for the tech sector. ""There will be more people leaving Amazon and wanting to do earlier stage start-ups than there will be people leaving start-ups to go work at Amazon,"" Mr. Mandel said."
4,2018-11-07," SAN FRANCISCO — Chicago offered $2 billion in tax breaks. North Carolina wrapped buses in Seattle with a pitch for Raleigh. A Philadelphia coffee chain printed the Amazon logo into the foam of its lattes. Now it may be all for naught. While Amazon has not officially said so, the technology giant is nearing a deal on where it is expanding next, according to people briefed on the discussions. After 20 finalist cities went to considerable lengths to lure Amazon to build a second headquarters within their boundaries — from promises of huge tax incentives and land deals to glitzy dinners with the cities' dignitaries — Amazon appears ready to increase its already sizable presence around New York, two of the people said. The company is also nearing a deal to expand in the suburbs of Washington in Northern Virginia, one of them said. When officials from most of the 18 other cities were contacted on Tuesday, they were reluctant to answer a simple question: Was all that a waste of time? In fact, many still held out hope that they have a shot. ""We are in the ninth inning of this process with no finalist having scored yet,"" said Aisha Glover, who helped lead the pitch from Newark, N.J. ""It's not over until it's over."" Ten officials said they were still pursuing Amazon or had not yet heard from the company about a decision, even though media outlets reported that their city was an also-ran. The officials said they wanted to avoid angering the nation's No. 2 private employer, after Walmart, which could still decide to open an office in their town someday. The cities had also signed extensive nondisclosure agreements with Amazon. When Maureen Krauss, the chief economic development officer for the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce, declined to comment, she noted, ""I have 37 NDAs in my office."" Some officials were talking, however, as news leaked out about Amazon's plans, and company executives did not seem pleased. ""Memo to the genius leaking info about Crystal City, VA as #HQ2 selection. You're not doing Crystal City, VA any favors,"" Mike Grella, a director of economic development and policy at Amazon, tweeted on Saturday. ""And stop treating the NDA you signed like a used napkin."" An Amazon spokesman said Mr. Grella was not involved in the headquarters search. The spokesman also said that the company had added more than 6,000 jobs this year in cities that applied for the headquarters but did not make the list of finalists, and that Amazon expected similar hiring in finalist cities that were not selected. Officials from the finalist cities spent more than a year compiling thousands of pages of documents, producing slick videos and hosting Amazon officials for tours and dinners at some of their area's best restaurants. Many proposals included billions of dollars in tax incentives. New Jersey offered $7 billion in tax breaks if Amazon chose Newark. Atlanta's mayor said the city had offered more incentives to attract Amazon  than it did for the Summer Olympics in 1996. In a 218-page proposal, Boston pitched a recently closed thoroughbred racetrack as a site, as well as mass-transit extensions and an ""Amazon task force"" of city officials to act as the company's contacts at City Hall. The Columbus Dispatch obtained more than 1,300 pages of documents prepared for the Ohio city's pitch, which detailed ""everything from the size of sewer lines on sites it was pitching to detailed hate crime rates in the city."" Columbus also said Amazon would not have to pay property taxes for 15 years. Toronto did not offer tax incentives but told Amazon that it would save billions of dollars because of Canada's universal health care, lower cost of labor and lower overall taxes. And Denver pitched a site near its airport and more than $100 million in incentives. New York's most recognized landmarks even turned  orange for Amazon for a night. In recent years, the AOL founder Steve Case has toured the country promoting the ""rise of the rest,"" the idea that the tech boom will eventually spill out into smaller cities in the middle of the country. But in focusing on two coastal megacities, Amazon may have called that narrative into question. ""It actually is deflating that maybe in this environment, there isn't a lot of opportunity for midsize cities,"" said Amy Liu, director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics, said Amazon's choice showed that big tech companies still cared more about talent pools than costs. ""The kind of people you're trying to attract are very diverse and globally oriented,"" Mr. Zandi said. ""That's a very difficult thing to find in a place like Indianapolis."" Local media from the left-out cities on Tuesday analyzed what losing meant for their hometowns. ""Even if Amazon played us, Dallas can learn from the HQ2 search"" was the headline of a Dallas Morning News editorial that said the city was better off with broad-based growth, which ""is more stable than being a one-horse town."" The Boston Globe columnist Scott Kirsner made the case that ""being stiffed by Amazon is a good thing."" He wrote that the company could have sucked up much of the city's talent and ""is one of the most insular, secretive and uncharitable companies I've ever encountered."" Many cities also enlisted their top elected officials, business leaders and athletes to assist in their bids. Todd Carmichael, chief executive of Philadelphia-based La Colombe Coffee Roasters, aided his city's lobbying and said it was all worth it. ""We swung at the ball and we didn't necessarily knock it out of the park, but it was great to have that opportunity,"" he said in an interview. ""And I'll never visit those cities ever again."""
5,2018-11-07," SEATTLE — For more than a year, Amazon searched for a second headquarters, a home to as many as 50,000 workers that would be coequal to its current home in Seattle. Instead, Amazon is closing in on deals to split what it called HQ2 into two locations, according to people briefed on the discussions. The company appears ready to move to Long Island City in Queens, according to two of the people. It is also close to a deal to move to a spot in Arlington, Va., just across the Potomac River from Washington, one of the people said. Much of the process has been secret, and Amazon had local officials and real estate developers sign nondisclosure agreements during negotiations. Here is what we don't know so far. The specific location in Long Island City is not known, but about 10 million square feet of potential office space was identified in the area, according to a third person briefed on the discussions. Amazon executives used the term ""campus"" to refer to the location during negotiations, another person said.  Amazon estimates 170 square feet per employee, according to a 2017 email from Amazon to a Colorado official disclosed in a public records request.  In Arlington, the plans center on Crystal City, an office area developed in the 1970s for defense contractors that largely left the area a decade ago. The developer JBG Smith acquired a portfolio of buildings a few years ago and now owns 44 percent of Crystal City, according to Rich Bradley, who was until recently the interim director of the Crystal City Business Improvement District.  Amazon could initially move into the older buildings in Crystal City, said Mr. Bradley, who was not directly involved with the bid. In September, JBG Smith backtracked on plans to convert an older office building into apartments, despite a glut of available office space in the area. Locally, the decision was seen as a sign that the space could be on hold for Amazon.  Mr. Bradley said some larger tracts nearby could be developed into new buildings over time. ""When you'd fly into National, you could see a building that says Amazon on the side,"" he said, referring to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Amazon has said it wants to build up its new presence quickly next year. Crystal City has more infrastructure in place, so Amazon could add workers there faster than in Long Island City, according to a source familiar with the plans. This is a billion-dollar question — or more. While some states made their incentive packages public (New Jersey and Maryland offered more than $5 billion each), Virginia and New York have kept theirs secret.  States, cities and counties often run their own incentive programs, each with different requirements. New York State, for example, provides tax credits to employers that move to certain parts of boroughs beyond Manhattan. Many experts expect large deals like this to come with offerings that would require state legislative approval. Usually they involve little public debate. After just a 10-minute public comment period, Apple got $213 million in state and local incentives to build a data center in Iowa, according to The Des Moines Register.  New York offered potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies, according to a person briefed on the process.  While Virginia has a reputation for being business friendly, it is not known for particularly outsize incentive programs. Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, which tracks corporate subsidies, said he expected that the legislature would pass a larger package just for Amazon.  In New York, Amazon could also benefit — directly or indirectly — from a provision in the tax overhaul that President Trump signed last year. To spur investment in ""distressed"" parts of America, the provision creates so-called opportunity zones, which were selected this year by governors and approved by the Treasury Department. Projects in those zones can reduce capital gains taxes and avoid those taxes entirely on profits from an investment held for more than a decade. There are a dozen opportunity zones in Long Island City, including in several areas marked for business development. Proposed program regulations from the Treasury Department would prevent Amazon from reaping the largest possible windfall of the tax break, because most of its business is outside the zone. But Amazon could set up a real estate company to buy land for the headquarters or surrounding buildings — and avoid any potential capital gains taxes if it ended up selling the property. Or it could lease the land from another developer that invests in the zone, insisting on more favorable leasing terms because the landlord is in line to reap opportunity zone tax benefits. ""Amazon coming, plus the opportunity zone incentive, is a huge gift to whoever owns the land in Long Island City,"" said Brett Theodos, a principal research associate at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research group. ""Now, if Amazon is a shrewd negotiator, they're going to say: 'We don't have to come here. We want a piece of that.'"" Megadeals like this typically involve city and state officials as well as real estate developers. In New York, Amazon executives met separately with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, according to people familiar with the process. In Virginia, Gov. Ralph Northam, the Virginia Economic Development Partnership and Arlington County officials have been involved. The formal announcement could come as soon as this week or next week, according to a person briefed on the process. Much past that, and it will run into Thanksgiving, Cyber Monday and the holiday season, when Amazon wants its headlines to be about shopping, not its buildings. J. David Goodman contributed reporting from New York, and Jim Tankersley from Washington."
6,2018-11-07," In the end, even Amazon has behaved according to this rule: In the modern tech economy, cities that already have wealth, opportunity, highly educated workers and high salaries will just keep attracting more of them. Of all its options across North America, the company appears to have narrowed its sights to New York and suburban Washington for a huge expansion of high-paying tech jobs. The 11th-hour decision to split its ""second headquarters,"" as Amazon is expected to announce shortly, makes the pattern only more glaring.  A small number of rich and internationally connected cities keep increasing their economic advantages — and as a result, the inequality widens between them and everywhere else. Because of the pull of ""superstar"" cities, economists and policymakers fear what will happen elsewhere if the winners keep winning while many smaller communities are left behind. It's possible Amazon executives genuinely believed a year ago that they might find a more surprising home (many observers are not so charitable). But, ultimately, the superstar magnet pulls them, too. ""It's just absolutely hard-wired into technology economies,"" said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""It's not just a sort of interesting thing that happens — it's inherent to the technology.""  Tech companies feed on highly educated and specialized workers, specifically dense clusters of them where workers and companies interacting with one another are more likely to produce new ideas. Washington and New York, as it turns out, are two of the most highly educated regions in the country, with already large pools of tech workers. ""In that sense, we look naïve in even raising the question that this could have gone to a different kind of Midwestern, heartland place,"" Mr. Muro said. ""There wasn't really an alternative."" By choosing to go where high-skilled workers and other prosperous companies already are, Amazon will effectively ensure that more companies follow it in turn. Opportunity will concentrate further. The differences between, say, New York and Scranton, Pa., will widen. This divergence, underway for about 30 years, has accelerated since the Great Recession. Between 2010 and 2017, according to Brookings, nearly half of the country's total employment growth occurred in just 20 large metro areas (places that are home to about a third of the population). The Washington and New York regions alone accounted for about half of the net increase in business establishments across the country between 2007 and 2016, according to the Economic Innovation Group, which tracks economic inequality across the country. ""This is a very rational decision for Amazon to make in the micro; in the macro, it reinforces a really challenging trend for the U.S. economy,"" said John Lettieri, the president of E.I.G. ""The divide between prosperous and distressed regions is growing wider. And it's because of things like this."" In previous economic expansions, E.I.G. has found, the benefits were more broadly felt, and growth was driven by more places, including rural communities. Today, data points about the national economy no longer describe well what's happening on the ground in many places.  Part of what has changed is that the American economy has become dominated more by companies like Amazon, which produce services instead of manufactured products, and thus employ software engineers instead of assembly line workers.  Drop a big Amazon headquarters into Washington or New York, and economists expect the 50,000 workers there to be more productive than if the same 50,000 jobs were dropped into Indianapolis. Simply putting them in New York, near so many other tech workers, increases the likelihood that Amazon invents more services, connects to more markets, makes more money. Those added benefits are so strong, economists say, that it's worth it to companies like Amazon to pay more — a lot more — for office space and employee salaries in New York City. ""If you are in the business of making new things — whether it's a new product, or a new way of delivering things, or a new service — and it's something that is unique, and it keeps changing and it needs updating, the most important factor of all is human capital,"" said Enrico Moretti, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. ""It's not like making soap, or like making textiles."" Mr. Moretti's latest research suggests that scientists who move from small to larger clusters of experts produce more inventions, a pattern that plays out regularly in Silicon Valley. Looked at another way, a majority of patents come out of the largest metro areas. If we spread their inventors evenly across the country, Mr. Moretti said, we'd probably have significantly less innovation in America. In its request for proposals, Amazon asked for good airport connections, public transit and strong universities. But it's not quite right to say that New York and Washington will probably win because they have these things. Rather, the presence of these amenities makes possible what Amazon was really looking for: that intangible thing that happens when certain kinds of workers are clustered in the same place. Communities that vowed to rapidly build transit from scratch missed that point. But of course the Amazon request didn't say, ""We're looking for knowledge spillovers and agglomeration effects.""  In one sense, it's good for the country that companies like Amazon are as productive as they are, where they are, thanks to these forces. But higher national productivity is no comfort to communities that aren't gaining jobs. Reconciling the two sets of places is one of the country's deepest economic challenges. ""This is too profound a structural shift to reverse,"" Mr. Lettieri said. ""It's not going to reverse. That's just the nature of the economy today.""  But maybe we can slow down this shift, he said, or find better ways to ensure that more people get to benefit from what's happening in superstar cities, and that more places get to join in this process. Mr. Lettieri argues that what's good for New York doesn't have to be bad for other parts of the country. It plainly looks that way in Amazon's case, however, because of the public sweepstakes the company invited. These 50,000 jobs that look likely to go to New York and Washington are 50,000 jobs that won't go to smaller finalists like Columbus or Nashville. Or to even smaller places, like Tucson or Fresno, that dropped out of the running months ago."
7,2018-11-07," (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good evening. Here's the latest. 1. The realignment of power in Congress.  Voter fury toward President Trump lifted Democrats into control of the House of Representatives, ending two years of single-party dominance. Some districts hit by retaliatory tariffs switched to Democratic candidates from Republican incumbents. See what the blue wave looked like. Republicans held their Senate majority and gained at least two seats. Voter turnout was unusually high — we're still gathering the data on that. Voters approved Medicaid expansion initiatives in Idaho, Utah and Nebraska by comfortable margins. Climate initiatives, though, earned mixed results. Among the historic firsts: the election of Muslim and Native American women. Catch up on the results from the House, the Senate and for governorships and other state positions. _____ 2.  The new Democratic majority in the House sets up the likelihood of two years of intense conflict with President Trump. Our chief Washington correspondent says the big topics they are likely to wrangle over are health care, investigating Mr. Trump, bipartisan efforts on drug pricing and public infrastructure, and appealing to millennials. For his part, Mr. Trump may have to choose between escalating the partisan warfare in Washington or trying to reach across the aisle. Mr. Trump pledged bipartisan cooperation and even praised Nancy Pelosi, whose return as House speaker is looking increasingly likely. But he also promised to adopt ""a warlike posture"" if Congress investigated his political and financial dealings, and renewed his attack on reporters. Above, a heated exchange at a news conference. _____ 3. ""Dear Mr. President, at your request I am submitting my resignation."" With much of the country mulling over the election results, President Trump made a high-profile ouster: Attorney General Jeff Sessions. He became a frequent and public target of the president after he recused himself from investigations into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. Matthew Whitaker, Mr. Sessions's chief of staff and a Trump loyalist, will step into the gap, as acting attorney general — and will oversee the Russia investigation, whose scope he has questioned as verging on a ""witch hunt."" Read our profile of Mr. Whitaker, written in September, when Mr. Sessions's resignation appeared imminent. Will Mr. Trump meet the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, at a lunch for world leaders in Paris on Sunday? The messaging has been contradictory. _____ 4. A few details are emerging about Amazon's near-deal to split its second headquarters between Long Island City in Queens, above, and Crystal City, Va., but there is a lot we still don't know. Specifics about locations and construction plans are blurry. Also unknown: how much state and local governments have offered in tax incentives and other benefits. What seems clear is this: Cities with high-skilled workers and other prosperous companies will continue to attract more of them. A formal announcement could come shortly — if only to clear the way for the holiday season, when Amazon wants its headlines to be about shopping, not its buildings. _____ 5. U.S. aviation regulators ordered an emergency revision in the manual for the new Boeing 737 Max 8 to help crews react if the plane nose-dives because of faulty flight sensor data — a possible contributor to the fatal crash in Indonesia last week. Investigators looking into the deadly crash of a new Boeing 737 Max 8 jet last week have determined that its angle-of-attack sensors — instruments that gauge the degree of the plane's ascent or descent — gave faulty readings. Above, investigating the engine. Boeing revealed that in a statement, adding that it had issued a global alert to airlines on how pilots can reclaim manual control. Sensors on the Lion Air jet had been worked on a day before the crash, which killed all 189 people aboard. _____ 6. The most powerful figure in Italy's populist government, Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, above, has pushed his image as a law and order tough guy, cracking down on immigration, declaring a war on drugs and creating a sense of public safety emergency. And he's trying to import American-style gun culture. While campaigning earlier this year Mr. Salvini, above, signed a cooperation pledge with a group advocating looser gun laws, and in September they notched a victory when the government made it possible to own more guns, including the semiautomatic AR-15. Italy's gun lobby doesn't have the clout the N.R.A. wields in the U.S., but it is growing. _____ 7. More than 300,000 flickering clay lamps were lighted in the northern Indian city of Ayodhya for the Hindu festival of Diwali. They're reflected in the Sarayu River, considered sacred in the Hindu religion. The holiday, also known as the festival of light, coincides with the Hindu new year and is a celebration of new beginnings and the triumph of good over evil. The 300,150 oil lamps broke a Guinness world record when they burned simultaneously for more than five minutes. Strong wind foiled the city's attempt to break the record last year. _____ 8. Beatboxers use tongue, throat, lips and breath to produce sounds that can resemble an entire band's worth of instruments. Scientists who study language hoped to observe how the sounds people intend to make are reflected in the way they shape their vocal tract. So they asked five beatboxers to perform in an M.R.I. scanner. Above, an image from the research. The video is fascinating. _____ 9. ""We need more weed!"" Three weeks after Canada legalized marijuana, some dispensary shelves are empty. The shortage is evidence of unexpectedly high demand, driven not only by novelty, experts say, but also by the desirability of government-regulated cannabis — it's contaminant-free. Above, in Vancouver. The shortage threatens to undermine a major aim of legalization: to tame an illegal marijuana trade estimated at 5.3 billion Canadian dollars annually. Some pot smokers say illegal dealers are seizing the moment, hawking home delivery services and lowering prices. _____ 10. Finally, an amazing discovery in a cave in Borneo. In a newly published paper, scientists say the image above of a four-legged animal found there was created more than 40,000 years ago, making it the earliest figurative art in the world. The age was determined with a new technique that analyzes the radioactive decay of uranium in flowstone, a translucent mineral deposited by water trickling down cave walls. Earlier known art is abstract, like patterns of lines. And figurative art almost as old has been found in Europe, demonstrating that humans around the world made the transition independently, and at roughly the same time. Have a creative evening.

0,2018-11-08," SAN FRANCISCO — Amazon may not be the only technology giant considering a big expansion in New York. Google is in discussions to move into a planned 1.3 million square foot office complex at the St. John's Terminal building on Manhattan's West Side, according to a person with knowledge of the company's plans but not permitted to speak about it publicly. The property, which is expected to be completed in 2022, would allow the internet giant to significantly increase its presence in the city. Google employs around 7,000 in New York, and a space that size could allow it to more than double its local work force. The potential expansion, reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal, comes on the heels of news that Amazon appears close to building a corporate office in the city. According to two people briefed on the negotiations, Amazon is close to naming Long Island City, a fast-growing neighborhood on the western edge of Queens, as one of two locations that would together house as many as 50,000 employees. Amazon's so-called HQ2 effort, a search for a second corporate headquarters outside of Seattle, has dragged on for about a year. Many were surprised when word leaked last week that the e-commerce company could end up with two new big offices instead of one. The other would be in Northern Virginia, outside of Washington. Amazon's potential arrival in Long Island City has some in the city hoping that New York could one day rival Silicon Valley as a tech hub. It has also raised concerns about whether the local infrastructure could handle such a rapid expansion. Google opened its first office in New York 18 years ago, but the company's ever-expanding work force has driven demand for larger offices and more staffing in the city. In March, Google spent $2.4 billion to buy the Chelsea Market building in Manhattan, where the company had set up some of its New York offices. The Chelsea office is Google's main workplace in the city, housing product and business teams for web search, ads and sales. A Google spokeswoman said it was also planning to add an additional 320,000 square feet of space with the redevelopment of Pier 57. The search for local real estate is part of a general expansion in the United States for Alphabet, Google's parent company. Last month, Alphabet said it had hired 9,000 employees in the United States this year, raising its total to 94,372 as of September. That was an increase of more than 16,000 from a year earlier. St. John's Terminal is being developed in Hudson Square by Oxford Properties, a Toronto-based developer. The 12-story building will incorporate a former freight terminal for the High Line and showcases rail beds as a central design feature. As tech companies expand in New York, they are likely to compete with Wall Street for engineering talent. New York has always had a significant technology industry of its own, though it has been dwarfed by the financial industry. For years, the city has ranked second or third among communities in the United States in total tech venture capital investment — with Silicon Valley and its surrounding area far and away the leader. New York's technology work force is also among the nation's largest, with many computer engineers working on the enormous data systems that power big financial institutions. Roughly 25 percent of Goldman Sachs's work force, for example, is dedicated to technology tasks, according to reports. Facebook also has a big office in New York, as do many other Silicon Valley companies. One of Microsoft's most important research labs is in the city. And some of the industry's most advanced research in complex and superfast computing systems is being done in New York, largely because of work with the big banks. But one thing the city has not been able to claim in a long time is a technology powerhouse of its own. The closest home of a tech heavyweight is Armonk, N.Y, about 40 miles away, where IBM is based. (IBM also has major offices in Manhattan.)"

0,2018-11-09," This week, word leaked that Amazon may be close to finalizing a deal to set up a major operation in Long Island City, Queens. The news, which was embraced with peak sycophancy by Gov. Andrew Cuomo — he literally offered to change his name to ""Amazon Cuomo"" to make it happen — came with a slap in the face to New York and every other state that bid for this deal.  For the past year, Amazon has been promoting a cruel tournament, asking cities to compete for the privilege of hosting a second headquarters outside Seattle — what the company called ""HQ2."" The winner was promised tens of thousands of jobs and the tempting vision of becoming a tech hub to rival San Francisco. Hundreds of cities prostrated themselves before Amazon, offering the company tax breaks and subsidies along with valuable data, such as infrastructure plans, to which no other company had access.  But as details of the reported deal trickle out, it seems clear that this whole tournament has been a sham. There is no HQ2. Instead, Amazon is expected to announce a fairly routine expansion, adding new satellites in Queens and in Northern Virginia. The countless hours spent courting Amazon were undoubtedly valuable for Amazon: the company gained free media coverage and untold amounts of economic data from each bidding city. But it has been a terrible waste for those cities and states whose public servants labored to win a prize that would never materialize. Even for the biggest Amazon boosters, such casual dishonesty should be cause for consternation. It's like getting a marriage offer along with a confession of infidelity. The tactic is all too familiar to the merchants who rely on Amazon's platform. Amazon starts these relationships by inflating expectations. Then, it uses its bargaining power to demand highly favorable terms, including requiring merchants to share sales data that they would normally never share with an outside company. Amazon extracts as much value and data as possible and shrugs off the initial visions, indifferent to whether these merchants go out of business. After making them dependent, Amazon sets all the terms of engagement, and the merchant is left with a terrible choice: quit Amazon and lose their business, or agree to a serf-like relationship. Most agree to serfdom. If Amazon indeed locates a substantial part of its business in New York, serfdom is the style of ""partnership"" the city should expect. Despite the familiar promises, Amazon is not a good partner. Not for the cities it occupies, not for the merchants who depend on it, not for the workers it employs. The company does not seek partnership; it seeks control. Seattle's experience shows that becoming dependent on Amazon did not lead to broader wealth; it has pushed up home prices and led to increased homelessness. Amazon also threw its political weight around in the city, spending millions in a brutal campaign to resist corporate taxes in Seattle. Unfortunately, New York has a long history of playing the fool in corporate relationships. Our state already ranks last in the nation in returns on billions of dollars in corporate giveaways. Its economic development programs are the most expensive in the country, amounting to 76 percent of the state's gross tax revenue. In 2015, Mr. Cuomo gave away $8.25 billion to corporations — as much as the next three states combined. If Mr. Cuomo gets his way, New York State will reward a mega-corporation that specializes in extracting money out of local neighborhoods. For every job Amazon may create today, hundreds of jobs at small businesses could be lost. It would be a special insult in New York City to sell out to a company so closely identified with squashing small merchants, stifling workers' rights and undermining the publishing and ideas industry. New York City is the heart and soul of the truly independent small business: idiosyncratic merchants that are rooted in their communities, making life rich, beautiful and chaotic for all New Yorkers. They include not only retail businesses, but also the dreamers who make things and sell them, such as CW Pencil Enterprise, which sells curated pencils in Manhattan; Pintrill, a Brooklyn-based company that creates and trades small pins, and Shine Electronics, an electronic store that buys and resells used cellphones, with its headquarters in Long Island City. No company has done more to decimate the power of these small businesses than Amazon has. New York has a long, strong history of union power, and Amazon has a long history of union busting. In a 45-minute video leaked by Gizmodo, Amazon's anti-union tactics were revealed, as Whole Foods team leaders were instructed in how to quell unionization after Amazon bought the company. Finally, Amazon has abused its power as gatekeeper of ideas in our culture. As Franklin Foer details in his book World Without Mind, when Hachette, the publisher, dared to challenge some of Amazon's contract demands in 2014, shipments to Amazon customers of books published by Hachette were delayed by weeks. Publishers are frightened to speak out against Amazon for fear that it will harm book sales. For New York to prostrate itself in front of a company trying to control the flow of ideas in America would be an insult to our commitment to open, diverse debate. At this point, it looks like Mr. Cuomo wants to rush into a deal with Amazon before there is any scrutiny, but New York can and should say no, at least until we know a lot more. The public should see correspondences between the Cuomo administration and Amazon to learn what promises have been made. The State Senate should demand a full study to examine the impact of any proposed deal on transportation and the cost of housing. We should hold hearings on Amazon's union-busting practices.  In other words, Mr. Cuomo and the rest of New York's public officials should fulfill their civic duty and reveal exactly what Amazon is promising, before entering into a relationship that will compromise the dignity and livelihoods of the people of our state. "
1,2018-11-09," Update, 10:35 a.m.: The chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Joseph Lhota, has resigned. Living and working in New York have ingrained in most of us a certain laissez-faire attitude to things big and grand. The transit system with more stations than anywhere else in the world ... yet not enough. The most populated school system ... yet we don't always have enough seats for every student. The most celebrated pizza in the country ... and yet we continue to try new styles. This week, New York appeared on the verge of landing a few more big things. Two of the tech industry's giants signaled an interest in expanding here, potentially bringing a combined 45,000 employees to Manhattan, where Google already has an office, and Queens, where Amazon is considering locating a headquarters. First, a caveat: No deals have been completed, so we don't know how many people these companies will employ in New York. Google has 7,000 employees in Chelsea, and that number could double if it moves into 1.3 million square feet of office space in the West Village. Amazon could bring up to 25,000 employees to Long Island City.  Tom Angotti, professor emeritus of urban planning at Hunter College, said he could not recall a period when New York planned to absorb so many workers from a single employer, let alone two.  ""Expansions tend to occur incrementally,"" he said. These tech giants will undoubtedly help reshape the city. New York can handle big. But is this too big? Probably not. New York will be fine. If that seems a little nonchalant, it's a well-earned attitude. ""It's a lot, but it's not a lot for New York's overall economy,"" Nicole Gelinas, an analyst at the Manhattan Institute, said. New York City gained 71,900 jobs from September 2017 to September 2018, according to the New York State Department of Labor. Many cities wouldn't be able to absorb that many jobs. But New York can.  And remember, we're talking about a possible maximum of 45,000 jobs. ""We shouldn't be dismissive of this number,"" Gelinas said. ""But it's not going to save us or break us either way."" Here's what else is happening: Leave the suede shoes at home and take an umbrella to work. Showers are possible after 4 p.m. Expect a high of 52.  🎶The sun will come out tomorrow. 🎶Eventually. Saturday Sunday My First Dead Body Dear Diary: It was 1979, and I was driving a Checker cab. I picked up a fare at La Guardia Airport. He was a heavyset man who appeared to be in his 50s. He was flushed and smelled of alcohol. In an angry voice, he gave me detailed directions to his apartment in Manhattan. Halfway there, bouncing along on the B.Q.E., I noticed that he was slumped over in the back seat. Ten minutes later, I pulled up to his building. He didn't move. ""We're here,"" I said, loudly. Nothing. I got out of the cab, opened the door and tapped the man. No response. Then I shook him. Nothing. I quickly drove to a hospital, parked and ran in. A few people were hanging around, and for a moment I wondered if there was a line. Then I yelled that I had a dead passenger in my cab. Within seconds, he was on a gurney, and from there into the emergency room, where a doctor ripped his shirt open. A police officer arrived, asked me some questions and walked away. When he came back, he said the guy hadn't made it, and that I could go. He handed me a $10 bill. He said the guy had it in his hand. The fare was $8.25. I thanked him. An orderly asked if I was doing O.K. I said I was. Then he asked me out. I declined, but thanked him as well. I drove the cab back to the garage in Long Island City, noting the death on my trip sheet. The dispatcher, sitting in the office behind bulletproof glass, bored and tired, looked at my note.  He shrugged, said, ""O.K."" and counted my cash. It was 4 a.m. — Eric Smith Hi everyone, it's Alexandra and Jonathan. Almost three years ago, when we took the helm of New York Today, we told you of our resolutions to walk every city street from east to west and to trek every avenue from top to bottom. More than 700 columns later, thanks to you — with your ideas, loyalty, feedback and encouragement — we've seen New York City through the most special lens there is. (Infinite lenses, actually.) We've reported on happenings at City Hall, corruption in Albany and how the chaos in Washington very deeply affects our home. We've covered the transit turmoil, the cases in our courts and the breaking news that drives each day. But we've realized that the stories that resonate just as much as policy and politics are those about the resilience and kindness of people in our community. Through our annual New Yorkers of the Year columns, we've met hundreds of neighbors — teachers, violinists, actors, firefighters, survivors, refugees, immigrants and citizens — who have made a difference here, in ways big and small. We've learned from New Yorkers over the age of 100, some who are no longer with us, about what it means to be engaged in this city, and how to do it. And we've also come to understand, in a place as intense as this one, the importance of stories that make you smile, laugh or feel something. (Like ""hair forecasts"" on rainy days. Or disputes over what makes a New York bagel. Or reviews of public restrooms. Or why New Yorkers do, indeed, wear so much black. Or why the best place to be for the holidays is alone in our great city.) So thank you for reading us as you rolled out of bed, for letting us join you for your morning cup of joe, for using us as a distraction when you were stuck on the subway, and above all, for believing in the power and beauty of local journalism. We hope you'll continue to do the same with our talented new columnist, Azi Paybarah, who officially takes over this column on Monday.

0,2018-11-10," The Times traveled hundreds of miles into the Brazilian Amazon, staying with a tribe in the Munduruku Indigenous Territory as it struggled with the shrinking rain forest. The miners had to go. Their bulldozers, dredges and high-pressure hoses tore into miles of land along the river, polluting the water, poisoning the fish and threatening the way life had been lived in this stretch of the Amazon for thousands of years. So one morning in March, leaders of the Munduruku tribe readied their bows and arrows, stashed a bit of food into plastic bags and crammed inside four boats to drive the miners away. ""It has been decided,"" said Maria Leusa Kabá, one of the women in the tribe who helped lead the revolt. The confrontation had begun. The showdown was a small part of an existential struggle indigenous communities are waging across Brazil. But the battle goes far beyond their individual survival, striking at the fate of the Amazon and its pivotal role in climate change. In recent years, the Brazilian government has sharply cut spending on indigenous communities, while lawmakers have pushed for regulatory changes championed by industries seeking unfettered access to parts of the Amazon that have been protected under the nation's constitution. Now, Brazil has elected a new far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, who favors abolishing protected indigenous lands. He has promised to scale back enforcement of environmental laws, calling them an impediment to economic growth, and has made his intentions for the Amazon clear. ""Where there is indigenous land,"" he said last year, ""there is wealth underneath it."" Long before Mr. Bolsonaro's victory, descendants of the original inhabitants of the Amazon, the world's largest tropical rain forest, had become increasingly vulnerable to bands of miners, loggers and farmers who have been clearing it at a rate environmentalists call unsustainable. From 2006 through 2017, Brazil's part of the Amazon lost roughly 91,890 square miles of forest cover — an area larger than New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Connecticut combined, according to an analysis of satellite images by Global Forest Watch. Thousands of square miles of forest have already been razed in indigenous territories, where large-scale industrial activity is prohibited. With Mr. Bolsonaro's victory, indigenous leaders are sounding more drastic warnings. ""He represents an institutionalization of genocide in Brazil,"" said Dinamã Tuxá, the coordinator of Brazil's Association of Indigenous Peoples. A spokesman for Mr. Bolsonaro's transition team said no one would comment on indigenous concerns, or respond to criticism of his views, because officials were focused on ""far more important issues."" Experts say the rate of deforestation in the Amazon, which soaks up enormous amounts of the world's carbon dioxide, makes it nearly certain that Brazil will miss some of the climate change mitigation goals it set in 2009, when it presented itself as an exemplar of sustainable development at a United Nations summit. The trendline has led federal prosecutors and environmentalists to say that the Amazon is on the brink of irreversible damage, potentially leading to the extinction of indigenous communities that have weathered centuries of calamities. ""The combined impacts of deforestation, climate change and extensive use of fire have brought the Amazon to the tipping point,"" said Thomas Lovejoy, an environmental science and policy professor at George Mason University. ""The indigenous people, who are the best defenders of the land, become vulnerable if the forest vanishes."" Many indigenous leaders see the threats against their communities as a modern-day David-versus-Goliath struggle, with tribes facing violent bands of men who take advantage of the Amazon's lawlessness to turn a profit. Officially, the fight over the Amazon's future is playing out far away in the legislative chambers of the nation's capital. After Brazil's economy plunged into recession in 2014, politicians and industry leaders who favor loosening environmental protections gained the upper hand in a long-running contest over the rain forest. They have had some success in weakening protections enshrined in Brazil's 1988 Constitution. But in many instances, the legal battle lags far behind reality. As miners, loggers and farmers charge into the Amazon, legally or not, the landscape is being radically reshaped. ""They haven't given up on changing the law, but they are prioritizing a strategy of creating facts on the ground,"" said Cleber Buzzatto, the executive secretary of the Indigenous Missionary Council, an indigenous rights group. ""By creating an irreversible reality, they will then seek to change legislation."" From the air, those facts on the ground look like bright orange gashes carved in the banks of lazy, zigzagging rivers that meander through the jungle. Few are as striking as the gold mine built around Posto de Vigilância, or Lookout Point, one of the most remote Munduruku villages. Osvaldo Waru Munduruku, the rail-thin village chief, looked ashen as he explained how his tiny hamlet, home to about 15 families, became a hub of the illegal mining trade that has transformed the region in recent years. The National Indian Foundation, a federal agency that helps indigenous people, had its aid budget slashed in recent years, making it hard for remote villages to get food or basic services. Beyond that, many indigenous leaders like Mr. Waru long for much better living standards, education and opportunities than an isolated, arduous forest existence allows. So when the first ""white miners,"" as he calls them, dropped by in 2015 to suggest a partnership, Mr. Waru was tempted. He and other indigenous leaders knew there was little they could do to stop the miners. The brutal recession had driven large numbers of unemployed Brazilians into the jungle, hunting for gold. If a gold rush was about to break out in his part of Pará state, he reasoned, the village might as well take a cut. This kind of co-optation has become common in remote areas of the jungle — and precisely what many indigenous leaders want to stop. ""Divide and conquer,"" said Fernanda Kaingáng, an indigenous rights lawyer who belongs to the Kaingang tribe. ""That is the strategy used to promote division with indigenous communities in order to secure access to wood, minerals and land."" The miners in Mr. Waru's village cleared a long strip for a runway and built a parallel settlement, with sleeping quarters and a small church. The miners rewarded him with 10 percent of the haul each month — worth a few hundred dollars, he said. ""We would save it and save it until there was enough to buy things for the community,"" Mr. Waru said. It paid for a new boat motor, a generator and a radio. But then the bouts of diarrhea among children began. Erosion from the mines turned the river a sandy brown. Fish that had long been a staple of the community's diet now had high levels of mercury, which is used to extract gold. ""Before, we had a lot of food here, but since the water became dirty, the fish vanished,"" he said. ""We became concerned about the future of our children."" More than 896,000 indigenous people live in Brazil — less than 0.5 percent of the population. They belong to 300 tribes and speak more than 270 languages. Their ranks are small compared with the millions of indigenous people in countries like Bolivia and Peru. Yet half a century ago, they were nearly extinct. In 1500, when the first Portuguese settlers arrived, three to five million people lived in what would later become Brazil. Smallpox and other diseases brought by the Europeans wiped out hundreds of thousands. Enslavement followed, first in sugar plantations and later when the rubber boom drew profitseekers to the Amazon starting in the 1870s. By the 1960s, when Brazil's military dictatorship began, the indigenous population had fallen below 100,000. The generals regarded indigenous communities in the Amazon as impediments to development and drew them out of remote villages to assimilate them. That policy was formally abandoned in 1988, when Brazil's current Constitution was drafted. It sought to atone for past abuses, setting in motion a process to mark and protect indigenous territories. There are now more than 600 of them, encompassing more than 13 percent of the country — a fact that has long rankled Brazilian loggers, miners and farmers. Here along the Tapajos River, the Munduruku, nearly 14,000 members strong, have splintered into dozens of small villages, scattered across a territory slightly larger than New Hampshire.  But as the recession hit Brazil's impoverished northeast and Amazon states particularly hard, outsiders with families to feed ventured into Munduruku land. They revived gold mines that the government had shut down in the 1990s. When the miners showed up in indigenous villages along the Tapajós in 2015, they found communities in worse shape than their own. In one, Caroçal Rio das Tropas, families live in dilapidated wooden huts and sleep in hammocks. Skinny dogs with festering wounds sniff the ground for scraps of food. Poisonous snake bites are treated by using the body of the serpent as a makeshift tourniquet while the patient makes the six-hour boat ride to the nearest town. Some families fare better than others, with television sets, cellphones and appliances powered by rumbling old generators. That, said Ezildo Koro Munduruku, is the result of gold proceeds that have transformed the area — and the tribe. ""Our grandparents' generation, they had a strong organization,"" said Mr. Ezildo, 41. ""They were all united. They had little contact with white people."" As mining camps multiplied, bringing processed foods, alcohol, drugs and prostitution to the area, several Munduruku men jumped at the chance to make money. Their diets changed and vices took hold. Many Munduruku worried that their way of life was being irreparably altered. ""Within our families, this began pitting brother against brother,"" Mr. Ezildo said. Some indigenous leaders initially argued that mining could be a boon, without causing too much environmental damage. But the gold brought only modest and fleeting benefits, he said. ""We are sick, physically and spiritually,"" Mr. Ezildo said. ""If one earns 100 grams of gold, they will spend it on alcohol and prostitutes."" After three days of tense debate, the women of the tribe gave the final word. Some pointed fingers defiantly at men in the room, while others cried as they took turns speaking into a scratchy microphone. When it was done, Ms. Kabá, the mother who helped lead the uprising, hung up a sign with bullet points to summarize the plan. ""Paralyze illegal mining activity in the indigenous area; clean up the territory and expel all the invaders from Munduruku territory,"" it said. The miners knew a revolt was coming and had tried to head it off. They flew to the village by plane, bearing massive bags of rice, beans and pasta, along with packs of grape- and orange-flavored soda — a peace offering. Cleber da Silva Costa, the miner who brought the bounty, said he knew what he and his fellow miners were doing was illegal and harmful to the environment. Yet he argued that his crime was merely a symptom of more egregious wrong. ""If you didn't have so many corrupt people in Congress, you might be able to consider preserving the environment,"" he said. Mr. da Silva, 47, a miner with three children, said the camp was doing more to preserve than destroy indigenous communities. ""The little they have today is from miners,"" he said. ""The government doesn't help. All the money gets stolen. We may be in the wrong. But out here, it's the law of survival."" Weapons in hand, about 30 members of the tribe set out to evict the miners. But after trudging for more than six hours through rivers, mud and steep hills, they reached the first gold mining camp exhausted, hungry and thirsty. Amarildo Dias Nascimento, the camp supervisor, sensed that a confrontation was imminent. So, in a disarming gesture, he welcomed the Munduruku delegation effusively, instructing his cooks to put on a feast of grilled chicken, beans and rice for the guests. ""Tonight, we'll just focus on joy,"" he said. Mr. Nascimento, 47, argued that the miners were merely trying to survive. ""Many have been left without options,"" he said, pointing at his men. ""Do you become a thief in Rio de Janeiro? Many are here because they don't want to resort to that. We're here fighting for our daily bread."" The next morning, Ms. Kabá breast-fed her baby as she summoned the miners for the showdown. ""This is our land,"" she said. ""This territory is not yours. This is where we get sustenance for our children. We don't depend on gold, but rather the fruits and animals you are driving away."" Mr. Nascimento listened politely, his head bowed. ""The moment you ask us to leave, we will do it immediately,"" he said. After the meeting broke up, several members of the Munduruku crammed into a bulldozer driven by one of the miners to avoid crossing a long, muddy patch of the trail on foot. But as they left, it was still unsettled when, or even if, the miners would leave. The Munduruku headed to the next mining camp, determined to deliver the same message. But the camp was larger, and they faced a far less welcoming group of miners. Several were drunk. ""We had to turn back because they were armed,"" Ms. Kabá said. Weeks later, dozens of heavily armed federal police officers and agents from Brazil's two environmental agencies descended on a mining camp in Munduruku land, sweeping in aboard four helicopters. The mission was the unveiling of Operation Pajé Bravo, code named for an indigenous myth about a malevolent person who must be exiled. While Brazilian lawmakers press to expand mining, logging and farming in the Amazon, some prosecutors and officials remain steadfastly against it, using their authority to enforce environmental laws for as long as they exist. But the raids do little. As usual, miners scattered into the forest as the aircraft approached, preventing investigators from making arrests or even asking many questions. Agents set fire to several machines and camp dwellings before taking off. ""It was like something out of a war zone,"" said Valmir, a miner who used his first name because he feared prosecution. ""None of us here are bandits. If the government offers some sort of employment for us outside of mining, no one would return to mining."" Days later, federal prosecutors searched gold dealers in the nearest major urban areas — the second phase of the investigation. This one was called Midas Dilemma, a play on the tale of King Midas and his dangerous ability to turn everything he touched into gold. ""We see a parallel with the exploitation of national riches,"" said Gecivaldo Vasconcelos Ferreira, a federal police officer who helped lead the investigation. ""If they aren't exploited in a responsible way, they end up becoming a curse."" Luis Camões Boaventura, a prosecutor on the case, says the authorities have only scratched the surface of an enormous industry backed by local and national politicians. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of gold mines along the Tapajós, and supply chains are deliberately opaque, making it hard to go after illegal mining bosses, he said. ""It is a very serious problem,"" he said. In May, prosecutors issued a call to action, warning that the gold trade ""could potentially lead to the extinction of indigenous communities and traditional cultures."" Federal prosecutors have characterized the plight of some indigenous communities as ""genocide."" But that stance is not widely shared by local, state or federal politicians. In Congress, a large coalition known as the ruralist bloc has championed scores of measures to ease access to minerals and potential farmland in protected areas. Mr. Bolsonaro, a veteran Congressman who easily won the presidential election last month, has long expressed the sentiment. ""If it were up to me, we would not have any more indigenous areas in the country,"" he said after winning. Doing away with them would require changing the constitution. But Mr. Bolsonaro has threatened to take smaller steps on his own, like halting fines against companies and individuals who break the law. He has put forward similar positions before. In 2012, after Mr. Bolsonaro was fined for fishing in a protected area, he introduced a bill in Congress seeking to bar agents from two federal agencies that pursue illegal mining, logging and fishing from carrying firearms. While campaigning for president, he called the system of protected lands obsolete, echoing the policy during the military dictatorship that such areas shackle economic growth and the individual prospects of indigenous people. The time had come, he said, to ""reintegrate them into society"" and recognize that they ""don't want to live in zoos."" Mr. Bolsonaro argues that Brazil can no longer tolerate having so much land set aside as indigenous territories, national parks and conservation zones. ""All those reserves stymie our development,"" he said. Munduruku leaders opposed to mining were elated about the raids by federal agents. But soon, leaders like Ms. Kabá received threats. ""The expectation of the indigenous leaders when they denounced what was happening was that the state would go in and expel the white people,"" said Danicley de Aguiar, a Greenpeace activist who has counseled Munduruku leaders. That did not happen. And while protecting the environment and indigenous traditions is laudable, it's not realistic, argued Adonias Kabá Munduruku, one of the tribe's leaders who does business with miners. ""It's the only way for us, as indigenous miners, to send out children to study in the cities, to have them go to university,"" said Mr. Kabá, 40. ""Parents want their children to learn, to be prepared, so they don't end up like their parents: working here in the mines."" Prosecutors have yet to charge anyone from the raids, and gold mining continues to flourish in the area. ""What we're seeing is that crime is paying off,"" said Paulo de Tarso Moreira Oliveira, a federal prosecutor."

Every Sunday, we'll send you the most important business and tech news, highlighting essentials from the past week and what's in store for the next. We'll keep it concise, informative and hopefully entertaining — because we know your time is precious, especially on the weekend. So have a read, tell us what you think, forward to a friend and then get back to your other Sunday standbys — perhaps you'll attempt one of these mesmerizing pies, gawk at Central Park's handsome celebrity duck or peruse Oprah's new ""Favorite Things."" After all, don't we all deserve a ""snuggle lounger"" — whatever that is? The most expensive midterm elections are behind us. So what now, besides a stock market that breathed a sigh of relief? With Democrats in control of the House, the Republicans' promise of future tax cuts look dicey, unless they can compromise by raising corporate taxes to pay for lower rates for the middle class. (President Trump said he'd consider it.) But don't expect much else in the way of bipartisanship. Now that Representative Maxine Waters of California is primed to lead a more hawkish House Financial Services Committee, buckle up for investigations into the President's real estate and financial dealings, starting with his dealings with Deutsche Bank.  Facebook claims to have won its latest battle against fake news. Its ""war room"" of employees working around the clock to fight false news stories collaborated with the F.B.I. last week to thwart a Kremlin-backed group of trolls that had meddled in the 2016 election. As a result, Facebook says, the midterms were relatively free of smear campaigns from foreign entities, at least on its platforms. But are Facebook's efforts sustainable — and are they enough? The network also released an independent report on its role in deadly hate crimes in Myanmar, and admitted that it ""can and should do more"" to prevent ""being used to foment division and incite offline violence."" After a yearlong (and much-publicized) quest to find a home for ""HQ2,"" Amazon may split its second headquarters between two new locations. The two are expected to be New York City — namely, the Long Island City neighborhood in Queens — as well as Crystal City in Arlington, Va. (In other offline news, an Amazon toy catalog — in print! — is scheduled to thump on your doorstep this month.) Meanwhile, Google is quietly buttoning up a deal to grow its Manhattan footprint, potentially adding space for more than 12,000 additional workers. The company also announced an overhaul of its sexual misconduct policy. On Monday, economic leaders from 21 nations will gather for the weeklong Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Papua New Guinea. China will have a flashy presence, literally, as it has given tens of millions of dollars for a swish renovation of the summit's convention center, as well as the country's main highway. Mr. Trump, who made his ""America first"" stance clear at last year's APEC meeting, will not attend; instead, he's sending Vice President Mike Pence. Which is just as well, perhaps, since the convention's hottest topics will include trade and climate change, and the president's views on these issues are not winning the United States many friends these days. On Thursday and Friday, the United States International Trade Commission will hold a hearing on the likely impact of his United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement on the economy and American consumers. This replacement of Nafta needs congressional approval to pass, which may be tricky now that the Democrats are about to have a majority in the House. The agreement focuses mainly on new rules for exporting cars, dairy products, wine and pharmaceutical drugs, but critics worry that some provisions will backfire. Auto production is one concern: If the deal makes this more expensive, it could raise prices for American car buyers and give incentives to manufacturers to move production elsewhere. The sale of David Hockney's 1972 painting, ""Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures),"" is estimated to fetch $80 million at a Christie's auction this Thursday. If the bidding does go this high, the piece will become the most expensive work sold by a living artist, a record held by Jeff Koons' ""Balloon Dog"" since 2013, when it sold for $58.4 million. Hockney not your taste? Edward Hopper's ""Chop Suey"" will be at Christie's too, expected to sell for $70 million to $100 million. The China trade war has trickled down to the lobster market, leaving Mainers high and dry with millions of pounds of unsold crustaceans. And speaking of weird-looking animals: The oldest known figure drawing — found in a cave in Borneo — depicts a reddish creature with spindly legs. Finally, Bill Gates is giving millions of dollars to teams trying to invent a better, more sanitary toilet for the good of humankind — and held up a jar of poop to announce it.

1,2018-11-11," LOS ANGELES — The Grinch, 61 years old, may be ""as cuddly as a cactus"" and ""as charming as an eel,"" to quote his creator. But slather him with high-fructose corn syrup (perky computer animation), roll him in a mega-marketing campaign (10 million Grinch-themed boxes shipped by Amazon alone), and the green critter is as sure a bet as there is in mass holiday entertainment. ""Dr. Seuss' The Grinch,"" based on the 1957 book ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" — and following in the Whoville-hating footsteps of the classic TV special, a stage musical, and a live-action film starring Jim Carrey — arrived in 4,141 theaters in North America over the weekend and took in a strong $66 million. The new film, with Benedict Cumberbatch leading the voice cast, cost Illumination Entertainment about $75 million to make and was distributed by Universal Pictures. ""Christmas came early this year,"" the studio said in a statement on Sunday. ""The Grinch,"" marketed with Grinchy ads that poked fun at itself (""Another remake?! Hope you're proud Hollywood""), took in an additional $12.7 million from 23 overseas markets, according to Universal. [Read the New York Times review of ""The Grinch""] Domestic ticket sales for the movie were on par with those for the first installment in Illumination's blockbuster ""Despicable Me"" franchise. The first ""Despicable Me"" collected $56.4 million over its first three days in July 2010, or $66 million based on today's ticket prices. But ""The Grinch"" fell behind Illumination's ""Dr. Seuss' The Lorax,"" which arrived to $78.2 million in ticket sales in March 2012, after adjusting for inflation. Second place for the weekend went to the surprise smash hit ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" (20th Century Fox), which took in an estimated $30.9 million for a two-week domestic total of $100 million, according to Comscore, which compiles box-office data. Turnout overseas has been equally astonishing: ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" a musical biopic about Queen and its flamboyant frontman, Freddie Mercury, has collected an additional $185 million outside of the United States and Canada. ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" has sparked renewed interest in Queen songs, benefiting an unusual owner of the music: Disney, which bought rights to the Queen catalog almost 30 years ago for its little-known Hollywood Records division. Aside from ""The Grinch,"" it was not a great weekend for new wide-release movies. ""Overlord"" (Paramount), a World War II horror thriller from a producing team that included J.J. Abrams, arrived to about $10.1 million in ticket sales, on the low end of prerelease expectations. ""Overlord,"" which cost $38 million to make and tens of millions more to market, collected an additional $9.2 million in extensive release overseas. ""The Nutcracker and the Four Realms"" (Disney) was fourth, taking in $9.6 million for a two-week domestic total of $35.3 million. [Read about 10 classic and cult Christmas movies as The Times first reviewed them.] Rounding out the top five was ""The Girl in the Spider's Web,"" which fizzled with about $8 million in ticket sales. Poor reviews likely held back ""Spider's Web,"" an R-rated thriller based on the best-selling novel of the same name. The film cost Sony, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and New Regency roughly $43 million to make, not including marketing. Overseas, ""Spider's Web,"" directed by Fede Alvarez, has collected $8.3 million. On the plus side for Sony: ""Venom,"" based on one of the lesser-known superheroes in Sony's stable, rolled out in China and took in a jaw-dropping $111 million, far surpassing opening-weekend totals for recent Marvel movies. Worldwide ticket sales for ""Venom"" now stand at $674 million."
0,2018-11-12," The innovation myth used to involve the back of a suburban garage or an office park in Silicon Valley. The tech industry was incubated not on the mean streets of the big city, but in sleepy hamlets like Murray Hill, N.J., and Mountain View, Calif. So with Amazon splitting HQ2, its second headquarters, between Crystal City, a part of Arlington, Va., and Long Island City, in Queens, what are we to make of tech's steady migration to marquee cities? Amazon is hardly alone, after all. Google and Facebook already have headquarters here (established, not incidentally, without state subsidies). Google intends to double its work force in the city to nearly 20,000. Twitter's second-largest office is in Manhattan. Its largest is in downtown San Francisco. On one level, this all seems inevitable. A handful of the wealthiest American cities today have a magnetic attraction. Today's biggest tech platforms seek them out to recruit top talent and gain access, at scale, to housing, schools and transit. The process means the rich get richer, the biggest companies, bigger. And the gulf widens between the country's haves and have-nots. On another level, the tech industry isn't culturally urban. Its insularity, secrecy, its bedrock libertarianism and algorithmic notions about progress, land use and corporate independence have never easily meshed with the slow, open-society, regulatory-heavy, greater-good mission that defines city living. Disruption is a virtue and instrument of efficiency in tech circles. But it isn't necessarily welcome where protections and a focus on collective welfare remain abiding democratic ideals. You may not have noticed, but New York now lags behind only San Francisco and San Jose, Calif., in tech patents. Last fall the campus of Cornell Tech, modeled after Stanford University as an innovation incubator, opened on Roosevelt Island. Negotiating that deal may very well end up being one of the most transformative moves made by Michael R. Bloomberg, the city's former mayor. That said, New York City is not Seattle or San Francisco. Here, tech is one sector in a megalopolis, sharing the limelight with finance, media, fashion, advertising and art. It's absorbed into the immensity. In contrast, San Franciscans famously rebelled against the private buses and corporate fortresses tech set up. Public officials there have proposed a ban on employee cafeterias in new office buildings because engineers and coders apparently never leave work to patronize local restaurants. Last week, San Franciscans voted in favor of a proposition to help the city's homeless that Marc Benioff, the Salesforce chief executive and now Time magazine owner, had backed, but that Twitter's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, vehemently opposed. And Mr. Dorsey wasn't alone. In Seattle, Amazon raised a ruckus when officials proposed a tax on large employers to help pay for services to the homeless. The company threatened to halt construction on a new high-rise. So the city dropped the plan. Amazon also insisted on nondisclosure agreements from the 238 cities bidding for HQ2. Scandalously, American cities and states now spend some $90 billion a year in cash and tax incentives to attract companies, money that could go for infrastructure, schools and police, and that usually doesn't pay off, as Derek Thompson pointed out this week in The Atlantic. Amazon's nondisclosure clause set up a process that allowed it, in effect, to crowdsource vast swaths of information about cities while preventing their citizens from knowing what their elected officials were doing to entice the $860 billion company. This is certainly not how New Yorkers like to operate. If New York hadn't landed Amazon, it would not have been a surprise if Dallas had. Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, apparently has a home in Texas, too. Scott Galloway, the business analyst and Amazon expert, tweeted a funny-but-true image showing the proximity between Mr. Bezos' homes and the company's current and prospective headquarters. Silly as it sounds, where bosses live turns out to be as good a predictor as any of where tech companies will settle. For years, suburbia has offered these companies acres of disposable, cheap, anonymous office parks: mostly one- or two-story concrete structures surrounded by loads of surface parking. These sites minimized costs, maximized security and allowed companies to scale up, contract or split into different units quickly — at the same time they promoted sprawl and traffic jams and transformed once-quaint bedroom communities south of San Francisco into phenomenally expensive places to live. Not that young tech workers, more and more of them immigrants, wanted to live in suburbia, anyway. Increasingly they demanded the diversity and benefits of city life. And so did successful innovation companies, following the lead of workers. Another way to put it is that companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon became attracted to cities like New York, Los Angeles, Seattle and Washington because these cities had already made transformative public investments in assets like culture, parks, universities and transit. The question for city residents is what these companies give back. I'm not saying companies move, or should be expected to move, for any reason other than to make money. Amazon promises tens of thousands of new jobs in New York, with all sorts of ripple effects beyond employing more coders, sales executives, baristas, nannies and yoga instructors. In one fell swoop, it bids to make good on 20 years of the whole post-Manhattan, cool-outer-borough narrative. But that isn't the only balance sheet. ""Urban life is built around a social compact,"" said Vishaan Chakrabarti, a Columbia professor and founder of the architecture firm PAU. Economic value creation in superstar cities like New York fuels a feedback loop that companies and cities both want to lean into. What does this mean? For starters, it means that the city and state now have even more reason to funnel money into subways, buses and a new tunnel under the Hudson River, and to pony up for the stalled BQX streetcar project linking Brooklyn and Queens, all of which would serve Amazon. In turn, Amazon, which dominates the book market, could, up front, make self-interested commitments in local school programs and, as Eric Klinenberg, a sociologist at New York University, advocates, in public libraries, our most vibrant, multipurpose community hubs. As for housing, the city's regulatory and zoning policies are more responsible for driving up costs than tech companies. But, in an ideal world, Amazon would reverse what it did in Seattle and commit resources to affordable housing in areas where its workers are moving; and it would pitch in for homeless services, which, by extension, would improve the daily lives of Amazon employees. Mr. Chakrabarti has a modest proposal, as well: The company could extend a hand toward Long Island City neighbors like LaGuardia Community College and Queensbridge, the largest public housing development in North America. There's no reason to presume Amazon will do any of this, of course. New York's abundance of resources, talent and ideas derives from its exceptional diversity and social infrastructure — urban virtues. Amazon could profit from its enhancement of New York as much as New York could profit from Amazon's presence. It's not how tech tends to work. But it's how this city works."
1,2018-11-12," [What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] Until recently, the most important thing to know about Amazon for residents of the Queensbridge Houses, the country's largest public housing project, was that any packages left in a lobby would likely be stolen. But Amazon will soon be a far larger presence in their New York City neighborhood. The company owned by Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man, will announce on Tuesday that it will establish a major headquarters in Long Island City, Queens, where Queensbridge's 26 aging buildings are home to a mostly black and Hispanic population with a median household income of $15,843, well below the federal poverty line for a family of four. Here, where livings are eked out on meager paychecks, or social service assistance, with nearly 60 percent of its households relying on food stamps, the new neighbor will be one of the world's most profitable high-tech companies, bringing what could be a work force of 25,000 people making salaries upward of $100,000. The stark contrast amplifies some of the social and economic tensions coursing through American society — a widening income gap, a lack of access to high-paying jobs for many minorities and a technology sector struggling to diversify. The planned location for the new headquarters is still unclear, as is whether Amazon will deliver any benefits to the roughly 6,000 people who live in the Queensbridge Houses and other disadvantaged parts of the neighborhood. ""What are they going to do for the community? Are they going to guarantee us employment opportunities?"" said April Simpson, the president of Queensbridge Tenants Association. ""I'm worried about, when they come, they're not going to have opportunities for people. Not just people from Queensbridge — but other lower- and middle-income people in this area. ""That's why we're leery about them coming in."" As New York City seeks to challenge Silicon Valley's dominance as a tech hub — Google recently announced plans for a significant expansion in New York — the explosion of jobs has helped propel the local economy. But it has not mitigated the ""tale of two cities"" narrative of economic disparity that Mayor Bill de Blasio has vowed to address in a city where the poverty rate in 2016 was 19.5 percent, significantly higher than the national rate. That stratification is keenly felt in Queensbridge, a gritty complex just across the East River from the East Side of Manhattan and some of the wealthiest neighborhoods and real estate in the country. Hard by the Queensboro Bridge, the Queensbridge Houses have been plagued with crime and drugs. Those problems have eased in recent years, Ms. Simpson said, and community programs have improved the quality of life. Last year, the housing project did not record a single shooting, something that had not happened in more than a decade and was a source of pride. But the neglect that afflicts many public housing developments and has led to harsh criticism of the de Blasio administration, persists here, residents and other local leaders said. ""There are still a lot of problems with the apartments — the lack of heat and hot water, non-working elevators, mold and broken front doors,"" said Jimmy Van Bramer, the city councilman whose district includes the Queensbridge Houses. Tyshema Basnight, 42, said she had been trying to rejoin the work force after raising a family. She has an associate degree in computer science and a tech job at Amazon would be a dream job, she said. ""For now, I'm just looking for secretarial work,"" said Ms. Basnight, who was among several residents lined up for one of the few aging computers available in the tenants association office for residents who do not have computers of their own. The office is not on the cutting edge of the digital frontier. And all the buzz over the e-commerce behemoth transforming Long Island City into a gleaming new-economy tech hub was met with skepticism, if not outright hostility. Many businesses — including travel and financial companies and hotel chains — have opened in recent years in the area, but Ms. Simpson said they have not hired local residents. ""They did not hire here — they brought in their own people,"" she said. ""My thing is: If you build here, hire here."" A spokesman for Amazon, Sam Kennedy, declined to comment on its plans in New York, but said that the company has a proven track record of funding and creating programs for the needy in Seattle, where Amazon has its main headquarters. This includes donating tens of millions of dollars, creating affordable housing, opening a shelter in its office complex for homeless families and creating a training program for the food service and culinary industries for less-advantaged residents. In Queens, the new companies that have come to Long Island City have helped transform the semi-industrial waterfront neighborhood into a haven for moneyed professionals. Since 2010 more apartment buildings have been built in Long Island City than in any other neighborhood in the city. Apartments in the more than 40 new buildings sell for an average of over $1 million. But past the gleaming skyline of high-rises, many residents fear that Amazon's arrival will only intensify the gentrification that is making the neighborhood less affordable for people of limited means. It is still unknown what financial incentives city and state officials may have offered Amazon or what, if any concessions, they have extracted from the company to help the neighborhood. City officials noted that the Queensbridge Houses had already been the focus of attention with projects to replace the roofs on all 26 buildings and install nearly 900 new security lights and 360 surveillance cameras. Mr. de Blasio is grappling with a lead-paint scandal at the city's public housing agency and accusations that officials had downplayed the number of young children in public housing with elevated levels of lead in their blood. Amazon's arrival, city officials insisted, would yield tangible gains for area residents. They said they were considering setting up programs similar to a city-funded employment center in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. ""Securing training and good jobs for local residents — especially those living in Nycha — is central to the way we craft major economic development initiatives,"" said Jane Meyer, a spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio, referring to the New York City Housing Authority. ""This is a tremendous opportunity to bring tens of thousands of good jobs to our city and open up good-paying careers in technology for New Yorkers."" Still, Mr. Van Bramer questioned the city and state's eager courting of Amazon at a time when the housing complex is still in need of funding for basic repairs. ""If we are helping a headquarters with 25,000 employees move in, a stone's throw from the largest housing development in the United States of America, we need more than lip service for the people of Queensbridge,"" he said. ""Before we throw corporate welfare at the richest man in the world, we should think about the crisis in Nycha, and address the needs of the community, including training Queensbridge residents for tech jobs — or they will be looking through the glass from the outside."" Outside a cluster of stores in the center of the Queensbridge Houses, Piif Jones, 29, said he has Amazon packages delivered to a secure locker at a nearby local check-cashing center, to avoid having them stolen from his lobby. Mr. Jones is an up-and-coming rapper trying to follow the illustrious tradition of hip-hop artists — Nas, Mobb Deep, Marley Marl, and others — who have come out of the housing project and have chronicled its hardscrabble conditions in verse. He spoke of belonging to the Queensbridge ""family,"" and taking pride in its success stories. Mr. Jones said he trained on computers in high school and if his rap career fizzles, he would happily take a job at Amazon. ""If Amazon doesn't hire from this community, we should boycott them,"" he said. But Andrew Johnson, a sidewalk bookseller near the busy entrance to the 21st Street-Queensbridge station on the F Train, took a more positive attitude. ""Not everyone here has a Ph.D., but anyone eager to work should be able to get job,"" he said. ""It can't be nothing but a plus."""
0,2018-11-13," (Want to get New York Today by email? Here's the sign-up.)  It's Tuesday. Good morning! Weather: Rain, mostly this morning, with a high of 51, then gradual clearing. Tomorrow the sun returns. Nice to meet you: My name is Azi (pronounced AH-zee). I used to report for The Queens Tribune, The New York Observer, WNYC and Politico before joining The Times last month as the reporter for the new New York Today. What we know: Amazon will announce today its plans to open a headquarters in Queens, which could eventually bring as many as 25,000 jobs to the city. Catch up: Both Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio are pushing for the deal. Local lawmakers are hesitant to give Amazon tax breaks to move here. My colleagues have reported that an influx of Amazon employees into the area could be problematic for Long Island City, and the job boost won't make or break New York's economy. The politics: Alliances are shifting. My colleague David Goodman obtained a letter sent last year to Amazon's C.E.O., Jeff Bezos, that was signed by six politicians and shows that a local councilman, Jimmy Van Bramer, and a state senator, Michael Gianaris, who represent the area and have recently been critical of the deal, were originally supportive. ""We write to you today because we know that Long Island City would be the perfect location for Amazon,"" the letter reads. Asked about the letter, Mr. Gianaris said nothing about his position had changed since last October. ""My feeling is the letter is completely consistent with my current position,"" he said. ""I welcome the jobs if it means Amazon investment in L.I.C. infrastructure, without us having to pay a ransom for them to be here."" Mr. Van Bramer also said he stood by his position, stated in the letter, and his current opposition to the likely Amazon deal. ""At no time were any of us told that Amazon would receive a billion-dollar package of subsidies and tax breaks,"" Mr. Van Bramer said Monday. ""And I never would have signed on to a process that seeks to evade meaningful and binding review by community and elected officials. Everything has changed since we allowed our names on that letter."" Why it matters: Some of Amazon's potential neighbors in Long Island City will be residents of Queensbridge, the country's largest housing project. The contrast would be a national symbol of ""the social and economic tensions coursing through American society — a widening income gap, a lack of access to high-paying jobs for many minorities and a technology sector struggling to diversify,"" writes The Times's Corey Kilgannon. A subway platform, a hurried passenger, a push, then a tumble and ultimately a death. My colleague Ashley Southall reported on the death of 89-year-old Kurt Salzinger, a behavioral psychologist who had fled Austria after the Nazi invasion. Mr. Salzinger died after he was pushed by a passer-by on a subway platform at Penn Station. I asked Emma Fitzsimmons, The Times's transit reporter, what the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is doing to prevent these types of accidents. She notes: 1) The M.T.A. has deployed workers, known as platform controllers, at busy stations to help direct traffic. 2) The M.T.A. has considered installing glass walls, known as platform screen doors, at busy stations to prevent people and objects from falling onto the tracks. 3) Andy Byford, the president of the New York City Transit, wants to install new signals to allow more trains to run each hour and help clear platforms more quickly. Scoop: Ronnie Lowenstein, the director of the Independent Budget Office, said in an interview that she will retire when her current term ends on July 31, 2022. She was appointed director on Aug. 13, 2000. While the mayor has an Office of Management and Budget that crunches numbers on revenue and expenses and provides estimates to make policy, the I.B.O. does similar work independently. The reason: To spend more time with her three grandchildren and to have more leisure time. ""Being at the Met at 3 o'clock in the afternoon when there aren't thousands of people crowding in front of you is just a wonderful experience,"" said Ms. Lowenstein, 67. The work: Ms. Lowenstein, who has a Ph.D. in economics from Columbia, translates budgets into easy-to-understand numbers. In 2004, her agency calculated that a latte tax would generate $12 million for the city. Picking a replacement: An advisory board will make a recommendation to a four-person panel that's appointed by the city comptroller, public advocate and the borough presidents. Name-calling. Harassment. Hidden emails. Made-up facts. The 2016 election was, in a sense, childish. Thankfully, a school in Queens let students in on the action. In ""The Candidates,"" Townsend Harris High School seniors play real candidates, and vie for the votes of underclassmen. We all know how the real voting went in 2016. I won't reveal how Student Trump, Student Clinton and Student Stein did in their election. The film debuted last weekend at DOC NYC. Tuesday's showing at the IFC Center (at 3 p.m.) is the last of this run. A pink tax?

But a closer examination shows the participants did not accurately represent New York's demographics. [Wired] Advocating no advocate: On Monday, New York Today wrote about the upcoming election to fill the soon-to-be vacant position of the city's public advocate. On Tuesday, a group of City Council members advocated eliminating the position. ""They don't do nothing,"" Councilman Rubén Díaz Sr. told Politico. Espinal joins the fray: Councilman Rafael Espinal says that he, too, is running for public advocate.

Dear Diary: Unable to find our marriage license, I've taken the train from rural Columbia County to Lower Manhattan to verify a marriage made 45 years ago. Social Security requires it for survivor benefits. The Office of the City Clerk hides the bustle of life inside. ""Enter through the glass doors,"" a sign says. Brides in white gowns or bright dresses light the rainy December day. Couples, some with children in strollers, surround me as they pose for photos. A white-haired woman in jeans and fleece catches my eye. Has she too lost her husband? We all file in together. Down a long corridor, fresh roses and orchids await buyers. The Records Room opens like a cave. I take a seat. Overhead, my number appears: B073. The clerk's diamond engagement ring flashes as she hands me the marriage license. Time shifts. Our third-floor walk-up at 57 Charles Street comes alive like a well-lit stage set: makeshift kitchen, gray walls, a sleeping alcove off the living room and a skylight over the bathtub.

On Saturday evenings, we picked up the paper at Sheridan Square.

1,2018-11-13," [What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] To attract Amazon, New York's leaders agreed to remake plans for the Queens waterfront, move a distribution center for school lunches and provide a sweeping package of $1.7 billion in incentives from the state and hundreds of millions more from the city. They even agreed to allow a helipad for Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive. Under the plan, within 15 years the company could occupy as much as eight million square feet of office space, the rough equivalent of three Empire State Buildings. An image of what life will be like with the arrival of Amazon became clearer on Tuesday, even if many questions remain unanswered. The company has agreed to follow city guidelines for the design of its outpost in Long Island City. But gone is the city's vision of a mixed-use community filled with apartments, some of them for residents of more modest means. In its place will rise office buildings that will house 25,000 or more workers. The  kayakers bobbing on the East River will now be joined by helicopters overhead. In some quarters of Queens, opposition was quickly building. ""Ask not what we can do for Amazon. Ask what Amazon can do for us,"" said State Senator Michael Gianaris, a Democrat who represents the neighborhood. But Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio seemed relieved to be able to finally discuss the long-secret negotiation and appeared jovial on Tuesday as they spoke about the economic benefits. Yes, it is among the state's largest-ever incentive packages, the governor said, but the return on investment would be 9 to 1. Yes, they were circumventing the usual land-use process and essentially eliminating any veto power by the City Council. But, Mr. de Blasio said, the project was so large, Amazon ""needed a certain amount of certainty."" The two Democrats, who have clashed on everything from the subway to how to handle a wayward deer, were all smiles as they shook hands. They congratulated the top executive from Amazon who had joined them, John Schoettler, a vice president for real estate. Together, they parried the many questions about the subsidies. ""Welcome to New York,"" Mr. de Blasio said after the first skeptical question from a reporter to the Amazon representative. ""The New York City press corps: You can either do this, or you can go to the dentist,"" the governor added. The location of the new headquarters is now certain — around what is known as Anable Basin. Amazon will take about one million square feet in the 50-story Citicorp building, long the only tower on the Long Island City skyline. City officials differed as to whether the company would decide to replace the large Citi sign atop the tower — visible from Manhattan — with a commanding Amazon logo. James Patchett, the head of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said in a telephone interview that Amazon is not interested in a sign. ""They have signage on their Seattle building,"" the deputy mayor for economic development, Alicia Glen, interjected during the same call. She added, of the Anable Basin location, ""I'm guessing they're going to call it Amazon Basin."" Whatever signs or nicknames are given to the site, some Queens residents and many elected officials expressed anger that the costs — in crowded subways, rising home prices, strained sewers and actual state and city tax dollars — could far outweigh the benefits of at least 25,000 new workers, making an average of what the company said would be $150,000. Local politicians were promising protests, objecting to the incentive package that could far exceed $2 billion, including existing city tax breaks. Others, however, including local business and technology groups and former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, praised the deal. ""Amazon's decision to locate to Long Island City is an affirmation not only of N.Y.C.'s growing tech talent,"" Mr. Bloomberg wrote on Twitter, ""but also of all the investments — in housing, schools, parks, transportation and culture"" made in Long Island City. Amazon said in a statement that, as part of the deal, it would donate space on its campus for a tech start-up incubator, artists, industrial businesses and a new school. It also said it would make investments in infrastructure and green space. The company also offered another sweetener: $5 million for training and internship programs and a promise to participate in ""job fairs and résumé workshops"" at the nearby Queensbridge Houses, the country's largest public housing development. The ability of the governor and the mayor to work together was a key factor in persuading Amazon to split its new office space between Long Island City and the Washington suburb of Crystal City, Va. ""We're both pragmatists,"" Mr. de Blasio explained, adding that he and the governor spoke several times during the yearlong negotiation. The governor went on to praise the mayor's new ferry system. [Read more about why Amazon wanted to make sure the mayor and the governor could get along.] Indeed, as part of one tour of New York City this year, Amazon executives were taken around the Cornell Tech campus on Roosevelt Island — an innovation incubator and a legacy of Mr. Bloomberg's tenure — and then to Long Island City, using the city's ferry system. At the moment, the site is little more than a series of low-slung buildings: a furniture warehouse, an armored car company, artist studios and a casual waterfront food spot, Anable Basin Sailing Bar and Grill. Some belong to the city; others belong to a private company, Plaxall. ""They should be allowed to build but they have to take into consideration the whole neighborhood,"" said Veselko Buntic, who owns the grill and rents from Plaxall. ""I don't want to see somebody big come in and destroy the community feeling we have here."" Richie Wissak, an owner of 55 Stan, a yellow cab company reminiscent of the 1970s television show ""Taxi,"" said he welcomed the arrival of Amazon. Next to the cab company was a shuttered strip club that Mr. Wissak said had been operating for 80 years and had only closed down six months ago. ""The community's not going to dig it too much, but I think it's going to be great for this area,"" Mr. Wissak said of Amazon's arrival. Still, the agreement, reached behind closed doors and so far without local input, has angered officials. Part of the reason is that, according to the broad contours of the plan, the state and the city will bypass the City Council, which has the power to block rezoning and land-use measures. They will instead employ a state-level process previously used for large-scale development projects, such as Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn and Hudson Yards on the Far West Side of Manhattan. The price tag in city and state tax breaks appeared to exceed those of other projects. ""It has the potential to be a deeper subsidy for Amazon as a percentage of the total project cost than at either Hudson Yards or Atlantic Yards,"" said George Sweeting, the deputy director of the city's nonpartisan Independent Budget Office. The process being followed by the state and city left critics with few options to alter or derail the deal. But some have vowed to fight. ""We're going to mobilize and protest and claim that democracy is still alive in Queens and in New York City and New York State,"" said Jimmy Van Bramer, the councilman whose district includes Long Island City. ""It's unacceptable and we're going to fight."" Opponents were planning to hold a demonstration on Wednesday in Long Island City. Mr. Van Bramer and Mr. Gianaris were not always against the idea. In October 2017, they signed on to a letter, along with the Queens borough president and other elected leaders, imploring the company to come to Long Island City. Asked about the letter on Monday, Mr. Van Bramer and Mr. Gianaris said they object to the steep subsidies offered the company. ""I welcome the jobs if it means Amazon investment in L.I.C. infrastructure, without us having to pay a ransom for them to be here,"" Mr. Gianaris said. Mr. Cuomo insisted that it was a sound business deal. ""You have to spend money to make money,'' he said in a telephone interview. ""You're betting on a winner."""

Outside Los Angeles, the Woolsey Fire has killed two and burned nearly 100,000 acres. As of Monday night, both fires were just 30 percent contained. You can find updates here. The Hill Fire, which has destroyed 4,500 acres in Ventura County, is 85 percent contained.

His strategy is ""strikingly similar"" to one the George W. Bush campaign adopted after the 2000 presidential election, our reporters write. A federal judge in Georgia has ordered a delay in the certification of the state's election results, citing concerns about voter registration and the handling of provisional ballots.

Was the operative referring to the powerful Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman?

3,2018-11-13," It's official: Amazon has anointed New York and Northern Virginia as locations for a major expansion, involving at least 25,000 employees and an investment of $5 billion. The announcement is the culmination of an intense bidding war among 238 cities for Amazon's promise of $50 billion in investment and 50,000 high-paying technology jobs. To land that deal, cities offered billions in tax breaks and incentives. According to the announcement, the company could score more than $2 billion in tax incentives from the two new sites.  In the end, only Amazon and other corporations won that war. By pitting cities against one another, Amazon created a frenzy of ever more lavish and outlandish offers. Maryland bid $6.5 billion in tax incentives and another $2 billion in infrastructure upgrades, and its transportation secretary at one point offered the company a ""blank check."" Newark dangled $7 billion in front of Amazon. Columbus, Ohio, said it would waive all property taxes for 15 years. Chicago offered to let the company pocket between 50 and 100 percent of the income taxes its employees would pay to the city. Fresno, Calif., proposed giving Amazon joint control over deciding where to spend its taxes. The problem is that once one city offers a company a lucrative deal, other employers want to get in on the bonanza. JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said he would watch to see which city won the beauty contest and immediately call up those lawmakers and demand the same perks. Other companies are lining up to do the same.  It's politically difficult for city and state officials to offer incentives to one firm and not another, Timothy Bartik, an economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, told me. Like Lay's potato chips, ""you can't hand out just one,"" as he put it. He fears that after the hysteria over Amazon's HQ2 and the recent $4.1 billion deal struck between the state of Wisconsin and the Taiwanese electronics company Foxconn, incentive amounts will only climb. Unfortunately, incentives and tax breaks don't work. Research by Mr. Bartik indicates that there is not a large correlation between a state's giveaways and its unemployment rate or income levels. And they're often poorly targeted; you would expect better offers for companies that can promise higher wages, but the packages don't actually vary from company to company very much. Lavish benefits also don't have much influence over the choice of a location. The typical package changes a decision only 25 percent of the time or less — about two-thirds of the incentives are handed to companies that would have moved to the state offering them, regardless.  Instead, the deals often end up being a burden on budgets. Texas schools have lost an estimated $4 billion to the state's economic development program and Cleveland schools lost over $34 million in one year alone. New Jersey's budget is at risk of bleeding $1 billion a year, while Michigan's liability for its business tax credits is set to soar to $9.38 billion over the next two decades and incentives have already led to a $325 million budget deficit. None of that accounts for the extra outlays to upgrade infrastructure and services for the people who move in to take advantage of any jobs that are created. Most subsidy recipients just simply do not need extra help to open up shop and create jobs. Good Jobs First, a policy group that tracks incentives, has found that about 90 percent of incentive dollars are swallowed up by big businesses, not small business owners who might need a push to get going. Amazon itself has already gobbled up over $1.6 billion in subsidies and incentives for its warehouses, distribution centers and subsidiaries, making it the leader among all corporate giants despite having billions in profit. Yet none of this has dented the popularity of economic incentives among lawmakers. That's partly because it's so easy to institute them and get political credit for doing something about employment without having to deal with any resulting failure later on — such as jobs or even entire companies failing to materialize, or budgets going bust. The solution, then, must be an armistice. States and cities need to collectively swear off big-dollar economic deals aimed at particular companies. If no one offers them, corporations will have to figure out where to locate on their own. There's nothing to love about these incentives. Republicans should be outraged by the idea of government picking winners and insist instead that companies be left to choose locations based on the conditions they need to operate their businesses, not sweetheart deals. Democrats should oppose them because they are starving state and city coffers of funds needed for important services, such as schools. And everyone can take a stand against handing companies buckets of cash that don't have any apparent impact on jobs or growth — and that they don't even need."
4,2018-11-13," To the Editor: Re ""Amazon Announces New York and Virginia as HQ2 Picks"" (nytimes.com, Nov. 13): The decision by Amazon to place its second headquarters in Arlington, Va., and in Queens represents a blown opportunity to do something positive for the country. If it had chosen to place a second hub in one of the less stereotypically ""coastal elite"" options on its list (or split between two of them — say, Columbus and Raleigh), Amazon could inject new energy, diversity and opportunity into regions suffering the negative side effects of globalization. Jeff Bezos could single-handedly do much to reverse the consolidation of America's urban professional class into a few cities, and thus begin to soothe some of the cultural divides. Placing a headquarters in the D.C. area will have a negative impact on American politics. Although politics has always been dominated by the wealthy, skyrocketing real estate prices in Washington have increasingly blocked young idealists willing to work long hours for low salaries. If the gentrification of Seattle is any indication, an Amazon headquarters in D.C. will result in more stories like the one this past week about Representative-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez being unable to afford an apartment in the nation's capital. Oliver KendallWashington To the Editor: My mind is plagued with disappointment and genuine concern now that it has been confirmed that Long Island City will be home to Amazon's HQ2 — or is it HQ1.5? I lived in New York City for 22 years, several of which I spent in Astoria, Long Island City's immediate neighbor. Over the years, I watched rents skyrocket, mom-and-pop shops convert into overpriced condos, and my town transform into a place that began to look like everywhere else. Amazon will only add to the destruction of Long Island City's and adjacent communities' sense of place, exchanging vitality and diversity for unfettered accumulation of wealth. The last thing the economic center of the world needs is more rich people. Amazon should have been honestly and openly vetted before it sinks its teeth into an already troubled culture of gentrification and inequality. I left New York City three years ago because my wife and I could no longer afford to raise our family there. I have no doubt that once Amazon is allowed to call New York its new home, I will soon be joined by thousands of other New Yorkers seeking refuge from one misguided company's insatiable greed. Jonathan PeleganoCleveland To the Editor: Although your article regarding Amazon's opening a headquarters in Long Island City refers to investments that Amazon has promised, it is not clear what the city will actually get in return for the up to $1.2 billion in tax breaks the company will receive from New York State. For example, what about desperately needed infrastructure improvements? Your article does mention that Amazon will ""retain bargaining power"" with New York for decades to come. When the Seattle City Council passed a tax on companies located there in order to fund solutions to a burgeoning homeless problem, Amazon successfully leaned on the council to reverse the law. Is this what's in store for New York? One more corporation dictating government policy? Daniele GerardNew York"
5,2018-11-13," (Want to get New York Today by email? Here's the sign-up.)  It's Tuesday. Good morning! Weather: Rain, mostly this morning, with a high of 51, then gradual clearing. Tomorrow the sun returns. Nice to meet you: My name is Azi (pronounced AH-zee). I used to report for The Queens Tribune, The New York Observer, WNYC and Politico before joining The Times last month as the reporter for the new New York Today. What we know: Amazon will announce today its plans to open a headquarters in Queens, which could eventually bring as many as 25,000 jobs to the city. Catch up: Both Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio are pushing for the deal. Local lawmakers are hesitant to give Amazon tax breaks to move here. My colleagues have reported that an influx of Amazon employees into the area could be problematic for Long Island City, and the job boost won't make or break New York's economy. The politics: Alliances are shifting. My colleague David Goodman obtained a letter sent last year to Amazon's C.E.O., Jeff Bezos, that was signed by six politicians and shows that a local councilman, Jimmy Van Bramer, and a state senator, Michael Gianaris, who represent the area and have recently been critical of the deal, were originally supportive. ""We write to you today because we know that Long Island City would be the perfect location for Amazon,"" the letter reads. Asked about the letter, Mr. Gianaris said nothing about his position had changed since last October. ""My feeling is the letter is completely consistent with my current position,"" he said. ""I welcome the jobs if it means Amazon investment in L.I.C. infrastructure, without us having to pay a ransom for them to be here."" Mr. Van Bramer also said he stood by his position, stated in the letter, and his current opposition to the likely Amazon deal. ""At no time were any of us told that Amazon would receive a billion-dollar package of subsidies and tax breaks,"" Mr. Van Bramer said Monday. ""And I never would have signed on to a process that seeks to evade meaningful and binding review by community and elected officials. Everything has changed since we allowed our names on that letter."" Why it matters: Some of Amazon's potential neighbors in Long Island City will be residents of Queensbridge, the country's largest housing project. The contrast would be a national symbol of ""the social and economic tensions coursing through American society — a widening income gap, a lack of access to high-paying jobs for many minorities and a technology sector struggling to diversify,"" writes The Times's Corey Kilgannon. A subway platform, a hurried passenger, a push, then a tumble and ultimately a death. My colleague Ashley Southall reported on the death of 89-year-old Kurt Salzinger, a behavioral psychologist who had fled Austria after the Nazi invasion. Mr. Salzinger died after he was pushed by a passer-by on a subway platform at Penn Station. I asked Emma Fitzsimmons, The Times's transit reporter, what the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is doing to prevent these types of accidents. She notes: 1) The M.T.A. has deployed workers, known as platform controllers, at busy stations to help direct traffic. 2) The M.T.A. has considered installing glass walls, known as platform screen doors, at busy stations to prevent people and objects from falling onto the tracks. 3) Andy Byford, the president of the New York City Transit, wants to install new signals to allow more trains to run each hour and help clear platforms more quickly. Scoop: Ronnie Lowenstein, the director of the Independent Budget Office, said in an interview that she will retire when her current term ends on July 31, 2022. She was appointed director on Aug. 13, 2000. While the mayor has an Office of Management and Budget that crunches numbers on revenue and expenses and provides estimates to make policy, the I.B.O. does similar work independently. The reason: To spend more time with her three grandchildren and to have more leisure time. ""Being at the Met at 3 o'clock in the afternoon when there aren't thousands of people crowding in front of you is just a wonderful experience,"" said Ms. Lowenstein, 67. The work: Ms. Lowenstein, who has a Ph.D. in economics from Columbia, translates budgets into easy-to-understand numbers. In 2004, her agency calculated that a latte tax would generate $12 million for the city. Picking a replacement: An advisory board will make a recommendation to a four-person panel that's appointed by the city comptroller, public advocate and the borough presidents. Name-calling. Harassment. Hidden emails. Made-up facts. The 2016 election was, in a sense, childish. Thankfully, a school in Queens let students in on the action. In ""The Candidates,"" Townsend Harris High School seniors play real candidates, and vie for the votes of underclassmen. We all know how the real voting went in 2016. I won't reveal how Student Trump, Student Clinton and Student Stein did in their election. The film debuted last weekend at DOC NYC.

[Wired] Advocating no advocate: On Monday, New York Today wrote about the upcoming election to fill the soon-to-be vacant position of the city's public advocate. On Tuesday, a group of City Council members advocated eliminating the position. ""They don't do nothing,"" Councilman Rubén Díaz Sr. told Politico.

Social Security requires it for survivor benefits. The Office of the City Clerk hides the bustle of life inside. ""Enter through the glass doors,"" a sign says. Brides in white gowns or bright dresses light the rainy December day. Couples, some with children in strollers, surround me as they pose for photos. A white-haired woman in jeans and fleece catches my eye. Has she too lost her husband? We all file in together. Down a long corridor, fresh roses and orchids await buyers. The Records Room opens like a cave. I take a seat. Overhead, my number appears: B073. The clerk's diamond engagement ring flashes as she hands me the marriage license. Time shifts.

6,2018-11-13," [What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] To attract Amazon, New York's leaders agreed to remake plans for the Queens waterfront, move a distribution center for school lunches and provide a sweeping package of $1.7 billion in incentives from the state and hundreds of millions more from the city. They even agreed to allow a helipad for Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive. Under the plan, within 15 years the company could occupy as much as eight million square feet of office space, the rough equivalent of three Empire State Buildings. An image of what life will be like with the arrival of Amazon became clearer on Tuesday, even if many questions remain unanswered. The company has agreed to follow city guidelines for the design of its outpost in Long Island City. But gone is the city's vision of a mixed-use community filled with apartments, some of them for residents of more modest means. In its place will rise office buildings that will house 25,000 or more workers. The  kayakers bobbing on the East River will now be joined by helicopters overhead. In some quarters of Queens, opposition was quickly building. ""Ask not what we can do for Amazon. Ask what Amazon can do for us,"" said State Senator Michael Gianaris, a Democrat who represents the neighborhood. But Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio seemed relieved to be able to finally discuss the long-secret negotiation and appeared jovial on Tuesday as they spoke about the economic benefits. Yes, it is among the state's largest-ever incentive packages, the governor said, but the return on investment would be 9 to 1. Yes, they were circumventing the usual land-use process and essentially eliminating any veto power by the City Council. But, Mr. de Blasio said, the project was so large, Amazon ""needed a certain amount of certainty."" The two Democrats, who have clashed on everything from the subway to how to handle a wayward deer, were all smiles as they shook hands. They congratulated the top executive from Amazon who had joined them, John Schoettler, a vice president for real estate. Together, they parried the many questions about the subsidies. ""Welcome to New York,"" Mr. de Blasio said after the first skeptical question from a reporter to the Amazon representative. ""The New York City press corps: You can either do this, or you can go to the dentist,"" the governor added. The location of the new headquarters is now certain — around what is known as Anable Basin. Amazon will take about one million square feet in the 50-story Citicorp building, long the only tower on the Long Island City skyline. City officials differed as to whether the company would decide to replace the large Citi sign atop the tower — visible from Manhattan — with a commanding Amazon logo. James Patchett, the head of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said in a telephone interview that Amazon is not interested in a sign. ""They have signage on their Seattle building,"" the deputy mayor for economic development, Alicia Glen, interjected during the same call. She added, of the Anable Basin location, ""I'm guessing they're going to call it Amazon Basin."" Whatever signs or nicknames are given to the site, some Queens residents and many elected officials expressed anger that the costs — in crowded subways, rising home prices, strained sewers and actual state and city tax dollars — could far outweigh the benefits of at least 25,000 new workers, making an average of what the company said would be $150,000. Local politicians were promising protests, objecting to the incentive package that could far exceed $2 billion, including existing city tax breaks. Others, however, including local business and technology groups and former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, praised the deal. ""Amazon's decision to locate to Long Island City is an affirmation not only of N.Y.C.'s growing tech talent,"" Mr. Bloomberg wrote on Twitter, ""but also of all the investments — in housing, schools, parks, transportation and culture"" made in Long Island City. Amazon said in a statement that, as part of the deal, it would donate space on its campus for a tech start-up incubator, artists, industrial businesses and a new school. It also said it would make investments in infrastructure and green space. The company also offered another sweetener: $5 million for training and internship programs and a promise to participate in ""job fairs and résumé workshops"" at the nearby Queensbridge Houses, the country's largest public housing development. The ability of the governor and the mayor to work together was a key factor in persuading Amazon to split its new office space between Long Island City and the Washington suburb of Crystal City, Va. ""We're both pragmatists,"" Mr. de Blasio explained, adding that he and the governor spoke several times during the yearlong negotiation. The governor went on to praise the mayor's new ferry system. [Read more about why Amazon wanted to make sure the mayor and the governor could get along.] Indeed, as part of one tour of New York City this year, Amazon executives were taken around the Cornell Tech campus on Roosevelt Island — an innovation incubator and a legacy of Mr. Bloomberg's tenure — and then to Long Island City, using the city's ferry system. At the moment, the site is little more than a series of low-slung buildings: a furniture warehouse, an armored car company, artist studios and a casual waterfront food spot, Anable Basin Sailing Bar and Grill. Some belong to the city; others belong to a private company, Plaxall. ""They should be allowed to build but they have to take into consideration the whole neighborhood,"" said Veselko Buntic, who owns the grill and rents from Plaxall. ""I don't want to see somebody big come in and destroy the community feeling we have here."" Richie Wissak, an owner of 55 Stan, a yellow cab company reminiscent of the 1970s television show ""Taxi,"" said he welcomed the arrival of Amazon. Next to the cab company was a shuttered strip club that Mr. Wissak said had been operating for 80 years and had only closed down six months ago. ""The community's not going to dig it too much, but I think it's going to be great for this area,"" Mr. Wissak said of Amazon's arrival. Still, the agreement, reached behind closed doors and so far without local input, has angered officials. Part of the reason is that, according to the broad contours of the plan, the state and the city will bypass the City Council, which has the power to block rezoning and land-use measures. They will instead employ a state-level process previously used for large-scale development projects, such as Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn and Hudson Yards on the Far West Side of Manhattan. The price tag in city and state tax breaks appeared to exceed those of other projects. ""It has the potential to be a deeper subsidy for Amazon as a percentage of the total project cost than at either Hudson Yards or Atlantic Yards,"" said George Sweeting, the deputy director of the city's nonpartisan Independent Budget Office. The process being followed by the state and city left critics with few options to alter or derail the deal. But some have vowed to fight. ""We're going to mobilize and protest and claim that democracy is still alive in Queens and in New York City and New York State,"" said Jimmy Van Bramer, the councilman whose district includes Long Island City. ""It's unacceptable and we're going to fight."" Opponents were planning to hold a demonstration on Wednesday in Long Island City. Mr. Van Bramer and Mr. Gianaris were not always against the idea. In October 2017, they signed on to a letter, along with the Queens borough president and other elected leaders, imploring the company to come to Long Island City.

""I welcome the jobs if it means Amazon investment in L.I.C. infrastructure, without us having to pay a ransom for them to be here,"" Mr. Gianaris said. Mr. Cuomo insisted that it was a sound business deal. ""You have to spend money to make money,'' he said in a telephone interview. ""You're betting on a winner."""

8,2018-11-13," It's official: Amazon has anointed New York and Northern Virginia as locations for a major expansion, involving at least 25,000 employees and an investment of $5 billion. The announcement is the culmination of an intense bidding war among 238 cities for Amazon's promise of $50 billion in investment and 50,000 high-paying technology jobs. To land that deal, cities offered billions in tax breaks and incentives. According to the announcement, the company could score more than $2 billion in tax incentives from the two new sites.  In the end, only Amazon and other corporations won that war. By pitting cities against one another, Amazon created a frenzy of ever more lavish and outlandish offers. Maryland bid $6.5 billion in tax incentives and another $2 billion in infrastructure upgrades, and its transportation secretary at one point offered the company a ""blank check."" Newark dangled $7 billion in front of Amazon. Columbus, Ohio, said it would waive all property taxes for 15 years. Chicago offered to let the company pocket between 50 and 100 percent of the income taxes its employees would pay to the city. Fresno, Calif., proposed giving Amazon joint control over deciding where to spend its taxes. The problem is that once one city offers a company a lucrative deal, other employers want to get in on the bonanza. JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said he would watch to see which city won the beauty contest and immediately call up those lawmakers and demand the same perks. Other companies are lining up to do the same.  It's politically difficult for city and state officials to offer incentives to one firm and not another, Timothy Bartik, an economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, told me. Like Lay's potato chips, ""you can't hand out just one,"" as he put it. He fears that after the hysteria over Amazon's HQ2 and the recent $4.1 billion deal struck between the state of Wisconsin and the Taiwanese electronics company Foxconn, incentive amounts will only climb. Unfortunately, incentives and tax breaks don't work. Research by Mr. Bartik indicates that there is not a large correlation between a state's giveaways and its unemployment rate or income levels. And they're often poorly targeted; you would expect better offers for companies that can promise higher wages, but the packages don't actually vary from company to company very much. Lavish benefits also don't have much influence over the choice of a location. The typical package changes a decision only 25 percent of the time or less — about two-thirds of the incentives are handed to companies that would have moved to the state offering them, regardless.  Instead, the deals often end up being a burden on budgets. Texas schools have lost an estimated $4 billion to the state's economic development program and Cleveland schools lost over $34 million in one year alone. New Jersey's budget is at risk of bleeding $1 billion a year, while Michigan's liability for its business tax credits is set to soar to $9.38 billion over the next two decades and incentives have already led to a $325 million budget deficit. None of that accounts for the extra outlays to upgrade infrastructure and services for the people who move in to take advantage of any jobs that are created. Most subsidy recipients just simply do not need extra help to open up shop and create jobs. Good Jobs First, a policy group that tracks incentives, has found that about 90 percent of incentive dollars are swallowed up by big businesses, not small business owners who might need a push to get going. Amazon itself has already gobbled up over $1.6 billion in subsidies and incentives for its warehouses, distribution centers and subsidiaries, making it the leader among all corporate giants despite having billions in profit. Yet none of this has dented the popularity of economic incentives among lawmakers. That's partly because it's so easy to institute them and get political credit for doing something about employment without having to deal with any resulting failure later on — such as jobs or even entire companies failing to materialize, or budgets going bust. The solution, then, must be an armistice. States and cities need to collectively swear off big-dollar economic deals aimed at particular companies. If no one offers them, corporations will have to figure out where to locate on their own. There's nothing to love about these incentives. Republicans should be outraged by the idea of government picking winners and insist instead that companies be left to choose locations based on the conditions they need to operate their businesses, not sweetheart deals. Democrats should oppose them because they are starving state and city coffers of funds needed for important services, such as schools. And everyone can take a stand against handing companies buckets of cash that don't have any apparent impact on jobs or growth — and that they don't even need."
9,2018-11-13," To the Editor: Re ""Amazon Announces New York and Virginia as HQ2 Picks"" (nytimes.com, Nov. 13): The decision by Amazon to place its second headquarters in Arlington, Va., and in Queens represents a blown opportunity to do something positive for the country. If it had chosen to place a second hub in one of the less stereotypically ""coastal elite"" options on its list (or split between two of them — say, Columbus and Raleigh), Amazon could inject new energy, diversity and opportunity into regions suffering the negative side effects of globalization. Jeff Bezos could single-handedly do much to reverse the consolidation of America's urban professional class into a few cities, and thus begin to soothe some of the cultural divides. Placing a headquarters in the D.C. area will have a negative impact on American politics. Although politics has always been dominated by the wealthy, skyrocketing real estate prices in Washington have increasingly blocked young idealists willing to work long hours for low salaries. If the gentrification of Seattle is any indication, an Amazon headquarters in D.C. will result in more stories like the one this past week about Representative-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez being unable to afford an apartment in the nation's capital. Oliver KendallWashington To the Editor: My mind is plagued with disappointment and genuine concern now that it has been confirmed that Long Island City will be home to Amazon's HQ2 — or is it HQ1.5? I lived in New York City for 22 years, several of which I spent in Astoria, Long Island City's immediate neighbor. Over the years, I watched rents skyrocket, mom-and-pop shops convert into overpriced condos, and my town transform into a place that began to look like everywhere else. Amazon will only add to the destruction of Long Island City's and adjacent communities' sense of place, exchanging vitality and diversity for unfettered accumulation of wealth. The last thing the economic center of the world needs is more rich people. Amazon should have been honestly and openly vetted before it sinks its teeth into an already troubled culture of gentrification and inequality. I left New York City three years ago because my wife and I could no longer afford to raise our family there. I have no doubt that once Amazon is allowed to call New York its new home, I will soon be joined by thousands of other New Yorkers seeking refuge from one misguided company's insatiable greed. Jonathan PeleganoCleveland To the Editor: Although your article regarding Amazon's opening a headquarters in Long Island City refers to investments that Amazon has promised, it is not clear what the city will actually get in return for the up to $1.2 billion in tax breaks the company will receive from New York State. For example, what about desperately needed infrastructure improvements? Your article does mention that Amazon will ""retain bargaining power"" with New York for decades to come. When the Seattle City Council passed a tax on companies located there in order to fund solutions to a burgeoning homeless problem, Amazon successfully leaned on the council to reverse the law. Is this what's in store for New York? One more corporation dictating government policy? Daniele GerardNew York"
10,2018-11-13," Amazon could have transformed a city. It could have created 50,000 high-paying jobs in a place with higher-than-average unemployment. It could have become the largest employer in a midsize city, or the central player in a new regional tech hub.  But the company that has radically transformed the retail industry has never shown much appetite for remolding cities.  And by announcing Tuesday that it would split its ""second headquarters"" between New York City and suburban Washington, D.C., Amazon has effectively chosen the lightest footprint possible — not 50,000 new tech jobs in a place where its presence would dominate, but 25,000 each in two booming areas that will handily absorb that growth (and the criticism that comes with it). That decision suits a company that has long worn its power and size in Seattle awkwardly. And it has been clear since early in its HQ2 search that Amazon wasn't interested in leveraging its growth for a civic reinvention project. Several cities explicitly framed their pitch around the appeal that Amazon could become the major local employer, and the catalyst for an urban revival. Baltimore promised the chance to ""permanently tie Amazon to the renaissance of one of America's greatest working-class cities."" Detroit's proposal suggested that Amazon would further help the city shed ""the blue-collar stereotype."" Camden, N.J., pitched itself as ""a city rising"" — a place Amazon could help lift up.  None of those cities were among the 20 finalists Amazon seriously considered. ""A bunch of cities in their initial proposal proposed that Amazon would be the center of their development strategy,"" said Nathan Jensen, a professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin who tracked proposals for HQ2. ""But these are the losers."" Instead, in New York and Washington, Amazon will find not only all the assets a tech company requires, but also some reprieve from the attention its status as the behemoth tech employer within Seattle has given it. In its hometown, Amazon now occupies fully one-fifth of all prime office space. In announcing the decision on Tuesday, Amazon's C.E.O., Jeff Bezos, mentioned the company's desire to ""become an even bigger part of these communities."" But that role in New York and Washington will be relatively smaller than if the company had chosen a different kind of home. In Northern Virginia and environs, even as Amazon grows to 25,000 jobs, the primary industries will long remain government services and defense contracting. In New York, Amazon isn't even the only big tech company announcing a major expansion in the past week; Google plans to swell in size there, too — albeit in Manhattan rather than Queens.  The ratings agency Fitch shrugged on Tuesday at what it considered the ""muted impact"" on the economies and credit ratings of New York and Washington. According to Fitch, 25,000 jobs are the equivalent of about a quarter of a percentage point of all the jobs in metro New York. In metro Washington, they'd represent about three-quarters of a percentage point of the labor force. The Washington region is already growing by about 50,000 jobs, or an Amazon HQ2, each year, according to the D.C. Policy Center. New York over the past year gained about 70,000 jobs. In contrast, a 50,000-person second headquarters, as Amazon originally proposed, would have amounted to about 5 percent of all jobs in several finalist regions: Columbus, Ohio; Nashville; and Indianapolis. The largest private employers in Nashville and Columbus today — Vanderbilt University Medical Center and JPMorgan Chase — each employ about 20,000 people. Amazon quickly would have become the largest employer, the permanent front-page story and the obvious scapegoat for civic problems in any of these midsize cities.  In Seattle, the company has chafed at all these roles as residents have increasingly demanded that Amazon give back to the city that helped make it so successful. ""They're doing some nice things now with charity,"" said Knute Berger, a Seattle native and longtime local journalist who has followed Amazon's growth there. ""But I don't think they want to take on a civic project. I don't think they see themselves as a civic company."" Amazon's relationship with its hometown grew more acrimonious this year when the city proposed a head tax on tech companies to help pay for homeless services. Amazon opposed the tax, threatening to halt its Seattle expansion if it were adopted, and the City Council ultimately backed down. That was a rare occasion when Amazon threw itself into local politics. ""What I've seen is a company that frankly engages very little, certainly in city politics — frankly, even in civic life,"" said Mike O'Brien, a member of the Seattle City Council for the past nine years. ""For a company whose power has increased dramatically, they haven't used that power in a way that I am used to seeing from other prominent name brands that are based here in Seattle."" Other companies keep lobbyists in close contact at City Hall. They buy expensive tables at charity dinners. They publicly campaign for transit improvements.  Boeing, formerly based in the Seattle region, used to encourage its employees to run for public office. Marc Benioff, the C.E.O. of Salesforce in San Francisco, vocally advocated an additional corporate tax there to help alleviate homelessness.  Mr. O'Brien said of Mr. Benioff, ""He's pretty explicit that, 'Hey, this is our city, too, and any problem that's the city's problem is our problem.'"" That was in stark contrast to Amazon's behavior, Mr. O'Brien said.  That Amazon has shied from such roles in its hometown suggests that it was unlikely from the start that it would relish revitalizing a struggling city, or even reprising its role as the big employer in a city. In deciding where to expand next, according to The Wall Street Journal, Amazon weighed whether it would be one of the largest employers in town.  It ultimately chose the places that could absorb Amazon, not the places Amazon could remake in its image."

12,2018-11-13," SEATTLE — [It's official: Amazon said on Tuesday that it would open new offices in New York and Virginia. Read our updated coverage of the news here.] After conducting a yearlong search for a second home, Amazon has finalized plans to have about 50,000 employees in two locations, according to a person familiar with the decision-making process. The company has decided to move to the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, and to the Crystal City area of Arlington, Va., a Washington suburb, the person said. Amazon, which plans to officially announce the decision on Tuesday, already has more employees in those two areas than anywhere else outside of Seattle, its home base, and the Bay Area. The need to hire tens of thousands of high-tech workers has been the driving force behind the search, leading many to expect it to land in a major East Coast metropolitan area. Many experts had pointed to Crystal City as a front-runner, because of its strong public transit, educated work force and proximity to Washington. [Crystal City's upsides: good transit, diverse residents, a friendly business climate and a single developer with a big chunk of land.] About 1,800 people in advertising, fashion and publishing already work for Amazon in New York, and roughly 2,500 corporate and technical employees work in Northern Virginia and Washington. Amazon narrowed the list to 20 cities in January, and in recent weeks, smaller locations appeared to fall out of the running. For example, although Denver made the initial cut, Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado said last month, ""Wouldn't they rather have their second big hub on the East Coast?"" Amazon announced plans for a second headquarters in September 2017, saying that the company was growing faster than it could hire in its hometown, Seattle. The company said it would invest more than $5 billion over almost two decades in a second headquarters, hiring as many as 50,000 full-time employees that would earn more than $100,000 a year on average. HQ2 would be the ""full equal to our current campus in Seattle,"" the company said. Picking multiple sites allows it to tap into two pools of talented labor and perhaps avoid being blamed for all of the housing and traffic woes of dominating a single area. It could also give the company greater leverage in negotiating tax incentives, experts said. ""Even if the most obvious reasons appear to be about attracting more tech workers, the P.R. and government incentives benefits could help, too,"" said Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed, an online jobs site. The HQ2 search sent states and cities into a frenzied bidding war. Some hired McKinsey & Company and other outside consultants to help them with their bids, investing heavily in courting Amazon and its promise of 50,000 jobs. Even half of that would amount to one of the largest corporate location deals on record, according to Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, which tracks corporate subsidies. ""These are very big numbers,"" he said. As Amazon's search dragged on, residents in many of the 20 finalist cities worried about the impact such a massive project could have on housing and traffic, as well as what potential tax incentives could cost the community. The decision to split HQ2 into two sites could alleviate some of that resistance. Seattle has been one of the fastest growing cities in the country, in part because of Amazon's growth. The company has about 45,000 employees in the city, and the company said it needed to hire more employees than the city could attract or absorb."
13,2018-11-13," ARLINGTON, Va. — Over the past few months, murals had started appearing on a fence surrounding an empty brick warehouse in the Crystal City neighborhood of Arlington. Sporting geometric shapes and adorned with hanging bicycles, the murals also displayed aspirational slogans in big black letters like ""What If?"" and ""Why Not?"" On Tuesday, Virginia government officials opened the gates to the lot where the murals had popped up. Inside, they held a news conference to welcome the object of their messaging: Amazon. ""Innovation is the lifeblood of our commonwealth and the driving force of Amazon,"" Virginia's governor, Ralph Northam, said to hundreds of cheering state politicians, business leaders, Amazon officials and real estate developers as he welcomed the e-commerce giant to the area. Mr. Northam delivered his address from a stage that had been secretly set up, with a lectern that bore a twist on the state's unofficial motto: ""Virginia is for Amazon lovers."" The hoopla celebrated a winning bid to lure Amazon, which announced Tuesday that it had chosen Crystal City and Long Island City in Queens, N.Y., for two new outposts that will eventually employ at least 25,000 people each. Mr. Northam deemed the victory by Crystal City as ""historic"" — especially for an area, just a few miles across the Potomac River from Washington, that has been crying out for revitalization. Crystal City was the dream of a local developer, Robert Smith, who in the 1960s began to construct commercial buildings and high-rise condominiums on lots once occupied by industrial buildings and junkyards. In a nod to its audacious goals, the neighborhood was named for the grand crystal chandelier that Mr. Smith put in the first building. In the 1970s and 1980s, Crystal City became a hub for government offices like the General Services Administration, corporations like US Airways and defense contractors. But in the last two decades, many of those tenants left, sending Crystal City into a prolonged decline and leaving it without a strong residential or commercial identity. A more recent boom in the Washington region has helped fuel some redevelopment in Crystal City. Steps away from Amazon's future headquarters is a new Whole Foods supermarket, which is owned by Amazon; a yoga studio; and Commonwealth Joe Coffee Roasters, a premium coffee shop. For Amazon, Crystal City was an obvious choice. With plenty of vacant properties and potential for redevelopment, the area gives the internet retailer a perch to sell more cloud storage services to the Department of Defense and other government agencies nearby. It is also minutes from Reagan National Airport, with many direct flights to Amazon's main headquarters in Seattle. The neighborhood is walkable and just a few subway stops from downtown Washington and Capitol Hill. The area also has one of the country's best-educated work forces, and the public school systems rank high. Amazon had announced 14 months ago that it would take bids from North American cities to create a second headquarters with 50,000 jobs, but if Virginians were disappointed with getting only half of what they bargained for on Tuesday, they didn't show it. ""First thing I want to say is 'Wow!'"" Brian Ball, Virginia's secretary of commerce and trade, exclaimed into the mic at the news conference. The audience applauded and shouted ""Woo!"" in affirmation. Mr. Northam said Virginia had to adjust some of its incentives with the announcement of only 25,000 jobs, but he wouldn't elaborate. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia also spent the day on a media tour, promoting the ripple effects of Crystal City's partnership with Amazon. In a morning interview with Yahoo, he pumped his fists in the air and said the benefits of Amazon's new offices would stretch into rural areas of the state. ""This is really a win for the whole region,"" Mr. Warner, a Democrat, said in the interview. ""It's not just immediate jobs but the enormous amount of spinoffs and what I think that will do to spur entrepreneurial activity."" Crystal City will anchor Amazon's presence in the area, but the company's offices will spill over into parts of the Pentagon City neighborhood and nearby Alexandria. Arlington and Alexandria officials branded the area as National Landing, a two-and-a-half-mile urban stretch connected by three Metro subway stations along the Potomac. Helping to drive Crystal City's winning bid was the real estate owner and developer JBG Smith, which worked with local officials to present a plan to Amazon. The plan included developing 150 acres of vacant buildings and empty land with the three subway stations and a station for the Virginia Railway Express, which connects to major cities in the state. Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, has not toured the site, a company spokesman, Jay Carney, said. But the location is convenient for the world's richest man: Mr. Bezos owns a massive Washington home — a former textile museum in the tony Kalorama neighborhood, just a few miles from Crystal City. Some Crystal City residents were joyful about Amazon's impending arrival on Tuesday, while others were wary. Evelyn Wong, a mother of two toddlers, said she was excited about the prospect of her home's increasing in value. On a Facebook page for her townhouse community of 200 units, residents have been posting frequently about Amazon's arrival and how much they might be willing to sell their homes for to developers, she said. ""I emailed my Realtor this morning to tell her I was so happy we bought last year,"" Ms. Wong said. Others were concerned about traffic and rising inequality in wages. Kevin Combes, a resident of Pentagon City, said Amazon could make residential development stall. ""Jobs-housing balance is critical to growing our cities in a sustainable way,"" he said. ""People should be able to live close to work, affordably. Crystal City was just beginning to convert vacant office space into housing, but that work has been halted."" Local government leaders promised to improve transportation, saying Amazon's arrival would help bolster work on Metro stops, the notoriously congested Route 1 in Arlington and other major roads. The company and local officials will also have to retrain skeptical residents on the new National Landing branding. Max Schwager, a Pentagon City resident, was among many locals confused by the National Landing name. ""It'll take decades for this name to actually take off, if it even ever does,"" said Mr. Schwager, a theater manager who has lived in the region for seven years. ""Especially with neighborhoods, people around here like to stick to their guns."""

15,2018-11-13," On a late October day, Amazon executives flew to New York to answer a final question before they committed to opening a massive technology center in Queens: Could Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio stop bickering long enough to see the project through? ""They wanted to just trust-but-verify that everybody was on the same page,"" said Alicia Glen, a deputy mayor who was at the meeting with Mr. de Blasio. After meeting with both men separately that day, the Amazon officials decided the two Democrats could put aside their longstanding differences. Soon after, documents were exchanged, and re-exchanged, ironing out details of a package worth more than a billion dollars in tax incentives and state grants. The politicians even agreed to a plan to circumvent the City Council to prevent future roadblocks. The deal for the Queens development, in Long Island City, was announced on Tuesday, after Amazon concluded a 14-month, countrywide search for a location for a second headquarters for some 50,000 well-paid tech workers. The company, which ended up picking two sites and dividing the new workers between them, is also opening a huge corporate site in Arlington, Va., in an area across the Potomac River from Washington. Amazon said the new developments, both to be called headquarters, would require $5 billion in construction and other investments. The company also said it would develop a much smaller operations and logistics facility in Nashville, creating 5,000 jobs. The announcement capped a frenzied competition among nearly 240 communities across the country. Many politicians saw it as an opportunity to remake their city or a neighborhood for the tech era. Some economists and policymakers warned against using public money to help one of the most valuable companies in the world, and of the potential for escalating housing costs and traffic. [Here's a $2 billion question: Did New York and Virginia overpay to attract Amazon?] Amazon said that the size and quality of the winners' labor pools decided the competition. Amazon was also offered more than $2 billion in tax incentives from New York and Virginia. Up to $1.2 billion of that will come from New York state's Excelsior program, a discretionary tax credit. In Virginia, the company could receive up to $550 million in cash incentives from the state by 2030, and $200 million more after that if it continues to hire. Both state programs are tied to the number of jobs the company creates — if Amazon's hiring falls short of projections, the incentive payments will be smaller. Both states have pledged to help Amazon with infrastructure upgrades, job-training programs and, in the case of New York, assistance ""securing access to a helipad"" — some of which did not come with a price tag. Still, in New York and Virginia, most top politicians hailed the Amazon news as a major victory, and the culmination of an aggressive sales job. ""We had an unprecedented opportunity to add to the number of jobs,"" Mr. de Blasio said on Tuesday. The project is a ""transformational opportunity to diversify the economy"" of Northern Virginia, which is heavily dependent on government contracting, said Stephen Moret, president and chief executive of the Virginia Economic Development Partnership. New York's sales pitch began in September 2017, immediately after Amazon began its search for a second headquarters that Mr. Bezos promised would be a ""full equal to our Seattle headquarters."" Amazon executives had realized that if its projections were right, the company needed a plan for its fast growth, said Jay Carney, a senior vice president at Amazon. It made the search public because ""you can't quietly talk to cities about investing $5 billion and creating 50,000 jobs,"" he said. Shortly after the announcement, a group of Long Island City leaders, including Elizabeth Lusskin, the president of the Long Island City Partnership, a business group, and Alan Suna, the chief executive of Silvercup Studios, a film and television studio there, were meeting to discuss their plans to bring biotech and life science companies to the neighborhood. But they quickly began talking about Amazon, according to Mr. Suna. Within a month, about 16 sites in the neighborhood had been identified, including the parcels along the waterfront eventually chosen by Amazon. The area is now a combination of public and private land that includes a distribution center for city school lunches, warehouses, studios and an outdoor bar and grill. When New York City submitted its bid to the company, just a few weeks later, Long Island City was one of four spots proposed, along with Lower Manhattan, Midtown Manhattan's West Side and an area in central Brooklyn. By January, Amazon narrowed the list to 20 locations, including New York. Amazon visited in April, July and September, said a person familiar with the meetings. The executives narrowed their search to sites on the West Side of Manhattan and in Long Island City before finally settling on the Queens neighborhood. Mr. Carney said Mr. Bezos did not tour any of the sites. The process was run by Holly Sullivan, who leads the company's worldwide economic development. John Schoettler, the executive who oversees Amazon's real estate, negotiated with the private developers. During one visit, the Amazon executives visited the Cornell Tech campus, a new high-tech school on Roosevelt Island, and took the ferry from there to Long Island City. They rode Citi Bikes as city officials and local Queens representatives showed off the area. On another occasion, they took the ferry at sunset. It wasn't until the past few weeks that things really took off. Gov. Cuomo met Amazon executives, including Jeff Wilke, who runs the company's retail business, in his offices on Third Avenue. From the window, he said, they could see the site along the waterfront Amazon would eventually select. ""I showed them the pictures of the progress of LaGuardia, of J.F.K., Penn Station, Kosciuszko Bridge — I explained what doubling the span means,"" he said, referring to building projects. He said Amazon executives were interested in having a pipeline of educated employees, not just from the top universities, but from other places such as Queens College and the nearby LaGuardia Community College in Long Island City. Amazon expressed concern about the city's planning process, which is slow and allows for local officials and the City Council to veto projects. The company's lawyers appeared to know about those pitfalls and wanted to avoid them. So Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo agreed to let the state control the approval, meaning there could be local input but no local veto. Mr. Cuomo said it was a ""friendly condemnation"" of the city-controlled land by the state, not a source of tension. Though the mayor and governor met separately with Amazon, they were in close contact, comparing notes and strategizing over the phone, according to a person briefed on the talks. ""I know him so well, it's just more open and verbal,"" Mr. Cuomo said in an interview. ""Whether it's good or bad."" Mr. de Blasio said, ""I'm very comfortable that we made the right move."" In Virginia, the initial HQ2 announcement came as the state was wrapping up a planning process to focus its economic development on tech, as well as diversifying away from government work. The request for proposal from the company ""hit right in the bull's-eye,"" said Mr. Moret of the Virginia Economic Development Partnership. The proposal for Northern Virginia, one of three regions presented by Virginia, stressed regional cooperation. The Arlington neighborhoods of Crystal City and Pentagon City, as well as the adjacent Potomac Yards neighborhood in Alexandria, were rebranded into a new area, National Landing, as part of the proposal. That is the name Amazon used in its announcement on Tuesday. Then after Virginia officials submitted the proposals in October 2017, things went quiet. A few months later, Victor Hoskins, the director of Arlington Economic Development, was walking up to the stage at a conference with other development officials when their phones started buzzing with news reports that Virginia, Washington and Maryland were among Amazon's 20 finalists. ""It quickly became, 'Hey, we got three locations in that list of 20, we've got a good chance here,'"" Mr. Hoskins said. Crystal City is a neighborhood filled with dated office buildings developed in the 1970s for military contractors. Much of it has sat empty since the Pentagon reorganized in the years after the Sept. 11 attacks. The developer JBG Smith had recently acquired much of the land and buildings there and was trying to spruce up the staid streets. Ahead of Amazon's first tour in late February, it wrapped buildings in colorful patterned fabrics, and hired muralists to decorate long construction walls and parking lots, trying to show how the neighborhood could be reimagined. Amazon visited several times, at one point going up to the top of a tower, near Reagan National Airport, for a bird's-eye view of Crystal City. But it was more down to business than New York. Catering was ordered in. ""Talent was at the core of a tremendous amount of our conversations,"" Mr. Hoskins said. He said Amazon never discussed the incentives or proposals other locales offered. Mr. Carney said inside Amazon, the team running the search decided at a meeting in August that it would be easier to hire the number of workers they wanted if they split the headquarters into two. (An Amazon spokesman later said the meeting happened the first week of September.) ""We also think that 25,000 as a floor is easier for the communities to absorb,"" Mr. Carney said. The company did not tell the cities about the split immediately. When Mr. Hoskins first heard about it, he was conflicted. ""You want the 50,000, but you know what, hey, 25,000 is a huge number,"" he said. By early November, local officials were feeling good. A small stage went up on an empty lot in Crystal City for the announcement, only to take be taken down quickly. It was premature. After a final round to address the last details, on Monday, Mr. Moret was driving through rural Virginia when he signed the final state agreements digitally, his cell reception cutting in and out along the road. ""We had a call from them just an hour after we executed it saying we won,"" he said. The company said it would start hiring in New York, Virginia and Tennessee next year."
16,2018-11-13," (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.)  Good evening. Here's the latest. 1. California wildfires are still blazing out of control, and the death toll has risen to at least 44. The Camp Fire in Northern California, blamed for at least 42 deaths, is now the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in the state's history. The sheriff's office in Paradise, a retirement community wiped out by the fire, said that more than 200 residents were unaccounted for. Our journalists visited a mobile home park, where residents waited anxiously for news of their neighbors. Above, a search team in Paradise. Outside Los Angeles, the Woolsey Fire has killed two and burned nearly 100,000 acres. One of our correspondents, a former Baghdad bureau chief, writes that the scorched landscapes are reminiscent of war zones — not just in how they look, but also in how they make people feel. _____ 2. A week after the midterm elections, with a more complete tally of votes, the results are better for Democrats and worse for Republicans than they first appeared. In the House, Democrats have gained 32 seats so far and could pick up 35 to 40 when counting is complete. In the Senate, following a win in Arizona, Democrats are likely to lose one or two seats in the final tally, rather than the three or four they expected after Election Day. Underlying shifts in the electorate suggest President Trump may have to walk a precarious path to re-election in 2020. Republicans suffered losses among women, young people, independent voters and Latino voters, researchers said, while Democrats gained with suburbanites and seniors. But, our Upshot columnist writes, Democrats have some significant weak spots, too. Above, the Capitol. _____ 3. President Trump is considering firing Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, in a major shuffle of his cabinet and West Wing staff, our reporters learned. Ms. Nielsen, above, has long been a target of the president, who has criticized her for being ineffective in implementing his administration's ""zero tolerance"" immigration policies. Other shake-ups could be in store, including the renewed possibility that Mr. Trump might push out John Kelly, his chief of staff and Ms. Nielsen's old boss. And Mira Ricardel, a foreign policy hard-liner who had been serving as a deputy to the national security adviser, was expected to be dismissed after running afoul of Melania Trump. ""It is the position of the office of the first lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,"" a spokeswoman said. Separately, Maryland has asked a federal judge to declare that the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, is the rightful acting attorney general — not Matthew Whitaker, the president's choice. Mr. Trump may not ""bypass the constitutional and statutory requirements for appointing someone to that office,"" the plaintiffs said in court papers. _____ 4. Amazon announced that it would split its second headquarters between two East Coast locations: Long Island City in Queens, above, and the area around Crystal City in Arlington, Va., just outside Washington. The new sites will eventually house at least 25,000 employees each, the company said, and will require $5 billion in construction and other investments. Amazon also said it would develop a smaller site in Nashville. The two locations sealed the deal with promises of more than $2 billion in tax incentives, tied to the number of jobs the company creates. So what should we think about tech's migration into wealthy U.S. cities? Our architecture critic weighs in. _____ 5. The Republicans' $1.5 trillion tax overhaul, which became law nearly a year ago, has lifted the American economy. Spending is up, paychecks are fatter, above, and large corporations are seeing bigger profits. But accounting for inflation, wage growth has yet to pick up. Supporters of President Trump's tax cuts said they would result in long-term changes in economic growth and business behavior. Did that happen? The results so far are mixed, according to our reporter covering economic and tax policy. _____ 6. No more mango. Juul Labs, the largest e-cigarette maker in the U.S., said it would remove nearly all of its flavored vaping pods from stores, and halt most social media promotion. The company is trying to stay ahead of new F.D.A. restrictions, expected this week, that would ban sales of flavored e-cigarettes and require age verification for online sales. Juul's device has become popular among children and teenagers, and the company has come under sharp criticism for its marketing. Above, a shop in Manhattan. The head of the F.D.A. has repeatedly called youth vaping an epidemic, and vowed to stop it. _____ 7. Boeing is facing new scrutiny over a crash in Indonesia. Pilots said the aircraft maker didn't tell them about changes to the emergency system on its new 737 Max 8 jet, the model in the Lion Air 610 disaster that killed 189 people. Investigators have been focused on whether the emergency system caused the accident. It's designed to automatically correct a plane's angle if it appears to be stalling. But if it malfunctions, it could send a plane into a potentially fatal nose dive. Above, the plane's engine. Indonesian transportation officials have said the manual for the new Boeing model didn't contain information about the update. And pilots said the onboard checklist, which contains information about overriding the emergency system, was incorrect. More than 4,700 orders have been placed worldwide for the Max 8. It is especially popular with low-cost carriers looking for dependable workhorses for shorter flights. _____ 8. There's a plan for Brexit. After months of deadlock, Britain and the E.U. have reached a draft agreement over the terms of their divorce. But there's still a long road ahead. The plan first needs approval from Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet, where hard-line Brexiteers could put up a fight, then from a Parliament stacked with opponents. Here are the sticking points that could derail the deal. Above, a demonstrator in London. Details of the outline agreement aren't available yet, but the prime minister has made it clear she wants to avoid a so-called no-deal Brexit, an abrupt withdrawal with no measures to avoid a chaotic transition. The cabinet is scheduled to meet Wednesday. If members give the plan the green light, European leaders will need to give it their blessing at the end of the month. Britain is scheduled to leave the bloc in March. _____ 9. Russia's efforts to meddle with U.S. elections are not a hoax. The 2016 campaign capped Moscow's decades-long strategy of creating divisions in the West and undermining democracies, often in places ill-equipped to combat the threat. Our Opinion team paired up with the BBC to produce a three-part documentary called ""Operation InfeKtion"" that exposes the K.G.B. spies who invented fake news, Russia's disinformation playbook and the global spread of the war on truth. _____ 10. Finally, for newly arrived immigrants, Thanksgiving — the most American meal — can be perplexing. Our Food writer followed cooks from across the globe who are preparing their first Thanksgiving feasts, part of their passage to American life. ""People do things in so many different ways here,"" said Mayada Anjari, a Syrian refugee, above. ""I was surprised that there's a holiday that everyone celebrates."" Have a gratifying evening.

0,2018-11-14," Throughout its 14-month search for a second headquarters — which has concluded with the dual selection of Long Island City, Queens, and Arlington, Va. — Amazon talked of its need for things like transportation, housing and a business-friendly environment.  But did Amazon really select New York City for its transportation system? The subways are a shambles. The company couldn't have chosen New York for its affordable housing because, as in Seattle, there isn't any. As for outdoor recreation, our beaches and parks are jammed, our soccer fields overrun. There's a lot more green space elsewhere. Cost of living? Hardly a selling point, unless you are seeking to increase your operating expenses. And no, Amazon didn't choose New York because it has real bagels — although it couldn't hurt. Amazon wants to develop a four-million-square-foot campus by the East River because of the talent that resides in New York. Lots of it. According to the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, New York has more than 320,000 tech workers in the labor pool, the most in the nation. (Washington is second.) That talent commands high salaries, great benefits and won't move to Pittsburgh or Austin or any other of the perfectly nice cities that tried to woo the online giant. Which raises the question: If New York has what Amazon wants, why is it paying the company so much to make the move? Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who offered to replace his given name with the company's to land the deal, are doing a victory dance.  ""New York can proudly say that we have attracted one of the largest, most competitive economic development investments in U.S. history,"" Amazon Cuomo said. They seem to have done so by overpaying. Landlords and real estate developers can rejoice at the prospect of soaring property values and rents, and restaurateurs, craft brewers and kombucha makers will see new customers among the 25,000 jobholders with an average salary of $150,000 that Amazon promises to hire over 10 years. But the plan calls for the state to dispense $1.525 billion to the company, including $1.2 billion from its Excelsior program, which will reimburse Amazon $48,000 for every job. Another state agency, Empire State Development, will offer $325 million to the Amazonians tied to real estate projects. As for the city, Amazon can apply for tax credits that could be worth north of $1 billion from programs known as ICAP and REAP that reward companies for job creation generally, and outside Manhattan specifically. (And the campus is in a federal redevelopment area that qualifies for corporate tax breaks, letting the company's major stockholder, the world's richest man, keep more of his wealth.) Oh, and Amazon wants a helipad for its chief executive, Jeff Bezos. No problem. Cities that lost out to New York offered far more in financial incentives. But the Commonwealth of Virginia is spending a piddling $22,000 per job in the initial phase of development in Arlington, and payments will max out at $750 million if Amazon creates 37,850 jobs. The state is also throwing in $295 million in transportation improvements, including a bridge to nearby Reagan National Airport so Mr. Bezos can remain close to his copter. That's still less than half of what New Yorkers will be paying out.  The prospect of handing Long Island City over to a company recently valued at $1 trillion seems distorted to some Queens politicians. They sense gentrification by fiat — another neighborhood sacrificed to the tech elite. ""I welcome the jobs if it means Amazon investment in L.I.C. infrastructure, without us having to pay a ransom for them to be here,"" said the neighborhood's state senator, Michael Gianaris. That is, rather than the state and the city paying off Amazon, Amazon should be required to invest in the subways, schools and affordable housing. It could also be required to include job guarantees for lower-income residents of Long Island City, not just flimsy promises of job training. Nothing has been carved in stone yet. The agreement is a memorandum of understanding, not a binding contract. No final deal should be pushed through without public input or approval. The mayor and governor would benefit from soliciting ideas from New Yorkers themselves, both those who live in Long Island City, and the other taxpayers footing the bill for the generous subsidies about to be given to the company. It's distressing that a mayor and governor who can't come together for the sake of the subways or public housing somehow managed to find common ground by doing an end run around the City Council and steamrollering the land-use process. We won't know for 10 years whether the promised 25,000 jobs will materialize. We do know that for decades states and cities have paid ransoms in the tens of billions of dollars to attract or ""keep"" jobs only to find themselves at the losing end of the proposition when companies moved on after the taxpayer freebies ended. During the Great Recession, it became commonplace for the auto industry to abandon one community after another despite lining its pockets with government money. Job promises were left in the dust of bankruptcy. Even in better times, economists have made a convincing case that these job development payout schemes aren't worth it.  New York City has long played this incentives game to encourage companies to bring jobs here or expand. (The New York Times Company has been a beneficiary.) The mayor argues that the increase in net tax returns of $13.5 billion that Amazon will provide over 25 years is ample return on investment. But the requirements of job creation and retention now favor big cities such as New York. Throughout the world, such cities have become economic powerhouses because of their ability to concentrate the resources that global corporations increasingly need. The days when companies such as General Electric, IBM, AT&T and Mastercard fled the city for boring suburban campuses, where innovation goes to sleep, are over. Building infrastructure for Amazon's future benefit may be too generous a bargain for it to strike when there's a compelling need for housing and schools and transportation for all New Yorkers right now. Mr. Bezos has owned a home here for years. He knows what our city has to offer; and as the web's biggest retailer, he knows what he's getting in setting up shop in Long Island City: a discount. So welcome, Jeff. Hope you enjoy your helipad."
1,2018-11-14," You can understand why Chuck Lorre would want to go dark with his new series, ""The Kominsky Method,"" for Netflix. The serious half-hour is where the cool kids are hanging out these days: ""Homecoming"" and ""Transparent"" on Amazon, ""Atlanta"" and ""Better Things"" on FX, ""The Girlfriend Experience"" on Starz. And as the most successful sitcom creator around, with an almost unbroken 25-year string of hits that includes huge moneymakers like ""The Big Bang Theory"" and ""Two and a Half Men,"" Lorre has some leeway. A track record like that has to come in handy when you're pitching a show whose punch lines mostly deal with death, loneliness and incontinence. It also helps when you can get Alan Arkin and Michael Douglas — 16 and 41 years removed from their last regular television work — to play the aging frenemies at the heart of your story. Inevitability isn't a good argument for a TV show's existence, however. ""The Kominsky Method"" (eight episodes arrive Friday) isn't a disaster; it has a certain warm-bath appeal, if you don't mind a thick foam of prostate jokes. But it is adrift in a bland netherworld between Lorre's precision-tooled, laugh-a-minute network comedies and the quieter aesthetic of the alt-sitcom, lacking the strengths of either. Douglas stars as Sandy Kominsky, an acting coach of minor renown whose promising career as a performer never quite panned out. Thrice divorced, he runs his studio with the help of his long-suffering daughter, Mindy (Sarah Baker), dates his 20-something students and hangs out with his agent and apparently only friend, Norman Newlander (Arkin). [Read the Times profile about Michael Douglas and his return to television at age 74.] Putting Douglas in the role of a silver-haired Hollywood Lothario (his hair is fantastic) who chose integrity over stardom can be seen as a clever bit of casting, both for and against type. The real (unintentional) twist, though, is having him play an acting coach who pushes his students to be honest onstage — given that Douglas, in his highly successful career, has consistently given closed-off, impenetrable performances. The one really notable exception was his relaxed, completely convincing portrayal of the middle-aged writing teacher Grady Tripp in ""Wonder Boys"" (2000), and the scrambling, half-principled Sandy is a little like Grady 20 years down the road, without tenure. Douglas is clearly comfortable with Sandy, and his performance is amiable and easy to like. But it's not much more than that: As a showrunner and writer, Lorre (who gets full or partial writing credit on all eight episodes) hasn't done anything to raise Douglas's game. What he has given him are platitudes and attitudes, the outline of a well-meaning Peter Pan confronting mortality and isolation without the substance. A sitcom character, in other words. You could argue that this is the point: As Sandy skirts financial ruin and vacillates over his relationship to an ""age-appropriate"" woman (played by Nancy Travis, 17 years younger than Douglas), Norman frequently calls him out on his shallowness. But those observations aren't insights so much as obligatory comic beats. Moving into single-camera naturalism, Lorre carries with him the structures and comic sensibilities of the multicamera network sitcom — he just slows the pace, stretching out the setups, and ratchets down the jokes, as if explosive laughs would be unseemly in these quieter surroundings. The show's sensibility is also decidedly retrograde and fueled by Hollywood nostalgia, which can be appealing when Sandy and Norman are meeting for lunch at Musso & Frank Grill but unappetizing in the scenes at Sandy's studio, where nearly every scene mocks the naïveté and political correctness of the young students. And while the bromance of Sandy and Norman is the heart of the show, the masculinity-in-moth-balls atmosphere can be overpowering. If you're a man who hasn't heard of retrograde ejaculation, you'll Google to see if it's a real thing, after which you'll feel a little sick to your stomach. Particularly egregious is the treatment of Norman's daughter, a pill-popping head case played by Lisa Edelstein who shows up for a few episodes to vex her poor father and is completely forgotten once she is dropped off at rehab. Norman, who experiences a tragic early loss and grows progressively morose and antisocial, is a bum part. But Arkin, still bringing sharp wit to aggravation and aggrievement, is the best thing about ""The Kominsky Method,"" even when the writing takes Norman into kvetching ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" territory. If you have to listen to someone complain about the modern world (""Skype — what a stupid word""), it might as well be him."

If you're interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. James Corden razzed Amazon on Tuesday for the anticlimactic news that it would set up new headquarters in New York and the Washington metro area. After a long decision-making process that saw cities across the United States vying for Amazon's selection, the tech giant announced that it was going with two of the most obvious options. Stephen Colbert welcomed the news that Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat, had won the Arizona Senate race. But he poked fun at the senator-elect for her reputation as a pragmatist and a centrist. Trevor Noah showed a picture of a group of high-school boys in Wisconsin that made headlines after circulating on social media. In the photo, taken earlier this year before a high school prom, almost every one of the more than 60 boys is shown giving what appears to be a Nazi salute. Jimmy Kimmel turned 51 on Tuesday. A random Seattle woman has been holding a party to celebrate Kimmel's big day for years. She's not really a fan — she just needed an excuse to party one day, and an annual tradition was born.

3,2018-11-14,"  (Want to get New York Today by email? Here's the sign-up.) It's Wednesday. 💰Who won? Powerball will present a New York record $343.8 million check today to a Harlem man for the Oct. 27 drawing. Weather: Sunny but chilly, with a high of 39. First freeze tonight: down into the 20s. And a messy mix of snow, sleet and rain tomorrow. Winter's coming. New: It's official. Amazon will open a major office in Long Island City, Queens, and another in Virginia. A third, smaller one, will open in Tennessee. What Amazon got: At least $1.7 billion in tax incentives from New York State. And a helipad, because, well, have you seen the subways in New York? What Amazon will provide: 25,000 jobs, eventually (or supposedly). When: Mayor de Blasio, who courted Amazon, said New York ""is about to"" get those jobs. But the credit agency Fitch Ratings said the impact will be more muted. [Daily News] Where: Long Island City, ""next to the largest public housing unit in the country,"" the mayor said. ""The synergy is going to be extraordinary."" Or it could turn out to be a glaring example of the growing divide between ascending and struggling communities. (Perhaps the Mr. de Blasio of 2013 would call it a tale of two cities.) The opposition: Critics say a giant company owned by the richest man on the planet shouldn't get tax breaks or incentives to move here. Where else can they go? Not many other cities can absorb a move of this size. Can it be blocked?: Unlikely because the deal is being arranged through a state agency under Governor Cuomo's control. Still, court challenges are likely. Because this is New York. The politics: It's a tale of two progressives, as The Times's Eliza Shapiro noted. On one side is Mr. de Blasio, who has worked to keep Walmart stores out of New York and often decries the influence of money. In July, we wrote a story headlined, ""Bill de Blasio Is a Progressive. But Is He Progressive Enough?"" On the opposing side is the congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of the Bronx and Queens (though her district does not include Long Island City). She has spoken out against the deal. The Onion's take: ""New York City Announces Subway Just For Amazon Employees Now"" From The Times's William Neuman at City Hall: With a huge turnout expected for Election Day, you might have thought that the Board of Elections would have placed as many ballot scanners as possible at its 1,200 polling places. But even as scanners were jamming all around town, causing lengthy delays, the board had about 1,000 scanning machines in storage, election officials said on Tuesday. Michael Ryan, the executive director of the board, said it ""deployed"" about 4,000 scanners. The board owns more than 5,000. A Manhattan board member, Frederic M. Umane, tried to explain why. He said the redesign and relocation in recent years of many polling sites to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act had reduced the space available to set up machines — and that the board therefore could not have distributed more of them. New: The new half-fare MetroCards for low-income riders will be available only for 7-day or 30-day passes, The Times's Emma Fitzsimmons reported. Catch up: After resisting the plan initially, Mayor de Blasio included the Fair Fares program in this year's city budget. It starts in January. Analysis: The Times's Nikita Stewart: ""A lot of people don't just live check to check; they live day to day. Buying a seven-day and 30-day pass can be upending if lost and takes a bigger chunk of money than $2.75 and $3 for the day."" New: City leaders of the Working Families Party voted Tuesday to endorse Jumaane Williams for public advocate, my colleague Jeff Mays reports. The vote gives Mr. Williams, a Brooklyn city councilman, a leg up in what is expected to be a crowded nonpartisan election this winter that could have 10 or more candidates. (If you'll recall, the outgoing public advocate, Letitia James, was just elected state attorney general.) The vote: Mr. Williams racked up 414,000 votes in the city during his unsuccessful run for lieutenant governor while working with the Working Families Party. Why it matters: It is expected to be a low turnout election. With volunteers on the ground, coordinating a small-donor campaign — Mr. Williams has never been a prolific fund-raiser — the group's support can be invaluable. At the trial of the notorious druglord, his lawyer argued El Chapo is not the mastermind behind the murderous Sinaloa cartel as prosecutors claim, but ""a scapegoat."" Alan Feuer, who's covering the trial in Federal District Court in Brooklyn for The Times, noted: Midnight maneuver: Alan reports this morning: Breathalyzer tests thrown out: A New Jersey court said 20,000 tests used to measure driver intoxication are inadmissible. My colleague Nick Corasaniti said this won't affect cases where drivers were falling down or showing other signs of drunkenness.

4,2018-11-14," Good Wednesday. Want this by email? Sign up here. Amazon confirmed yesterday that it had picked New York City and Northern Virginia for its new hubs. (Nashville will get a logistics facility as a consolation prize.) But skeptics are asking whether the price tag — a combined total of $2 billion in tax credits, rebates and other incentives — was worth it. Here's what each location promised: • New York offered Amazon more than $1.2 billion in incentives, and a pledge that Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio would stop bickering long enough to see the project through. The city also agreed to a helipad for Jeff Bezos. • Virginia promised about $800 million in incentives (and the all-important helipad, too). It also rebranded the neighborhoods that will host Amazon's office as ""National Landing."" Officials from each location said that Amazon's offices would create at least 25,000 jobs. But critics say the incentives set a worrying precedent: Bryce Covert writes in an NYT Op-Ed that other companies will now expect similarly extravagant windfalls in exchange for offices. And some local politicians have already publicly opposed the plan. Meanwhile, Shira Ovide of Bloomberg Opinion thinks Amazon may have outsmarted itself: ""The year of hoopla during a period of deepening anxiety about powerful technology companies means there will be more attention on whether Amazon is a good corporate citizen."" More tech job news: Amazon and Google are in a race to hire software developers. British and European Union officials reached a long-awaited draft agreement yesterday over Britain's withdrawal from the bloc. Now comes the hard part. At 2 p.m. today (9 a.m. Eastern), Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain will meet with senior cabinet ministers to assess the plans. They reviewed the draft text overnight, though the details haven't been made public. Getting to this point has not been easy, and it involved months of labored discussions — particularly about contentious issues like the Irish border. But Stephen Castle of the NYT points out how pivotal today's meeting is: If the deal is rejected today, Mrs. May's leadership could hang in the balance. If it passes, it still requires approval by E.U. officials at a meeting in Brussels later this month — and would then be subject to a highly unpredictable Parliament vote. Follow how events play out today in the NYT's live briefing. More Brexit news: The departure could leave wedding bouquets stuck at the British border. But the supercar manufacturer McLaren is, unusually, increasing production capacity in Britain. The price of oil continued to slide this morning, with Brent crude hitting $65 a barrel in London after falling 6.6 percent yesterday. There may be some technical trading issues at work here. But fundamentally, the markets worry that there's too much oil. ""When you put all these ingredients together, you have a recipe that's not really conducive to an $85 market environment,"" Michael Cohen, an oil analyst at Barclays, told the FT. Oil's drop has already had an effect on the stock markets, with energy stocks dragging down the S&P 500 yesterday, and that could worsen today. But there's one potential upside for investors: Falling oil prices and a strengthening U.S. dollar may convince the Fed to pause its interest rate increases.

The Japanese conglomerate will invest $3 billion in WeWork, giving the co-working start-up more money to expand — even as its losses continue to grow. SoftBank's new cash solidifies its status as WeWork's single biggest financial backer, and gives the eight-year-old start-up a valuation of at least $42 billion. More important, it will help the company offer more desks for rent around the world. The cash comes at a crucial time: WeWork disclosed that it had lost $1.22 billion so far this year. The company says it still needs to spend on growth, but it could eventually focus on turning a profit. If, or when, it decides to go public, that could become vital. CNN filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration yesterday, arguing that its withholding of press credentials for the correspondent Jim Acosta violated the Constitution. More from Mike Grynbaum of the NYT: The Trump administration plans to fight back. But Floyd Abrams, a First Amendment lawyer who represented the NYT during the Pentagon Papers case, told Politico, ""I can't think of anything that is likely to lead to a victory for the White House."" Yet Noah Feldman of Bloomberg Opinion says that, politically, Mr. Trump has already won by undercutting the news media. The National Defense Strategy Commission said in a report published yesterday that the ""security and well-being of the United States are at greater risk than at any time in decades."" The panel urged Congress to act: The commission noted that authoritarian nations like China and Russia were seeking ""the means to project power globally,"" and added that ""the proliferation of advanced technology is allowing more actors to contest U.S. military power in more threatening ways."" Its report suggested a number of priorities for Congress. Its conclusion: ""Innovations in operational concepts and leap-ahead technologies are vital to sustaining U.S. military advantages"" in the long term.

5,2018-11-14," After 14 months of pitches, meetings and offers of incentives and name changes, Amazon announced on Tuesday that its second headquarters would be on two sites: one in Long Island City, Queens, and another in Arlington, Va. The company is also developing a smaller operations and logistics facility in Nashville.  Here are some details you might have missed in all the coverage: Company executives flew to New York just to establish that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio could put aside their longstanding differences.  Although the two have clashed on everything from the subway to handling deer, they were all smiles on Tuesday. ""I know him so well, it's just more open and verbal,"" Mr. Cuomo said. ""Whether it's good or bad.""  Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, will be able to come to work by flying over the East River — where kayakers now bob. Office buildings will rise and make room for 25,000 workers. How can this happen so fast? The state and city will bypass City Council, which has the power to block rezoning and land use measures. New York's leaders have also agreed to remake the Queens waterfront, move a distribution center for school lunches, and provide a package of $1.7 billion in incentives from the state and hundreds of millions more from the city.  He already owns a huge home near the Arlington site — a former textile museum in the wealthy Kalorama neighborhood in Northwest Washington, D.C., just a few miles away. But he did not tour — and has not yet toured — that site or Queens. Company executives ran the selection process in both states.  Amazon's offices will spill over into parts of the Pentagon City neighborhood and Alexandria. Local officials rebranded the two-and-a-half-mile urban stretch, connected by three Metro subway stations along the Potomac, as a new neighborhood and called it National Landing.  It will rejuvenate a place filled with dated office buildings developed in the 1970s for military contractors. Some of that space has been sitting empty since the Pentagon reorganized after the Sept. 11 attacks.  The rebranding has already sparked conversation on social media. Mr. Cuomo said he was doing everything that he could to lure Amazon in.  ""I'll change my name to Amazon Cuomo if that's what it takes,"" Mr. Cuomo said. ""Because it would be a great economic boost.""  It will take about one million square feet in the 50-story Citicorp building on Long Island City. There was debate over whether the company would replace the Citi logo, which is visible from Manhattan. But Amazon is not interested in a sign. Alicia Glen, the deputy mayor for economic development, pointed out that the area is known as Anable Basin, ""I'm guessing they're going to call it Amazon Basin.""  What do you give a man who is one of the world wealthiest people? Business leaders in Tucson tried to mail Mr. Bezos a 21-foot cactus. The plant was returned — it would have suffered in the Seattle rain anyway. The mayor of Frisco, Tex., offered the chance of getting a Jamba Juice and catching the ""Frisco Flu."" Canada's offering was just Canada.  As noted above, New York promised Amazon at least $1.7 billion in incentives. Virginia promised incentives worth $573 million, including $550 million in cash grants.  Economists have long criticized tax incentives as inefficient and unnecessary measures that leave less money for education and public works. Altogether, the two locations offered more than $2 billion in tax credits, rebates and other incentives to Amazon.  Bryce Covert, a contributing opinion writer, also notes that the lucrative deals being given to Amazon may mean that other cities will expect similar treatment when they try to set up shop.  In New York, the company will be a stone's throw from Queensbridge Houses, the largest public housing complex in the United States. The buildings are home to a mostly black and Hispanic population with a median household income well below the federal poverty level. Local residents have expressed worry that jobs at Amazon would not be open to them. Amazon has promised training and internship programs and to participate in job fairs at the housing complex. New companies in Long Island City are already transforming the semi-industrial waterfront area and are drawing in moneyed professionals, raising concerns that more intense gentrification will drive up costs."
6,2018-11-14," Here is what was on view on Election Day in Jonathan Adler's company headquarters on Hudson Street in Manhattan: a bit of Brutalism; lots of organic modernism (of the sort once seen in 1960s-era Reform synagogues); a dash of Egyptian revival (but the '70s version); scenes from the Memphis movement; references to pre-Columbian pottery, and to early '80s disco tropes and Pop Art; many, many objects emblazoned with marijuana leaves (including a stunning beaded and embroidered textile that read ""Weed"" in a medley of greens); and an elderly and very grumpy Chihuahua atop a lavender towel on a shredded lime-colored chair. Trained in semiotics and art history at Brown, Mr. Adler has long been known for his exuberant style that is also a big tent of references. It was nearly 30 years ago that the designer, now 52, made a line of quilted pottery inspired by Chanel bags, and 20 years ago that he opened his first home store on Broome Street.  His company now has 17 stores worldwide, a wholesale and e-commerce business, and a residential and commercial design practice. Last month, Mr. Adler introduced a collection for Amazon called Now House: whimsical objects and furniture in mod black and white and postmodern pastels. Delivery is free and speedy with an Amazon Prime membership.  A stoneware ""Wink Box,"" shaped like an eye, is $30 and can be to you the day after tomorrow; a Josef sideboard, honey-colored wood with a whorled pattern on its doors ($798), will take a little longer. Below, he answered some pressing questions. Before we get to that collection, what's this tray of ashtrays and vessels printed with red lips and joints and marijuana leaves? It's an exclusive for a pot store called Higher Standards, a capsule collection. I always say, ""Live clean and decorate dirty."" I don't smoke or do any drugs, but you can get a decorative dirty frisson. But you used to? When I was a teen, I started making bongs. That was the great thing about being a potter. You could make bongs. I used to smoke a lot of pot and listen to a lot of Grateful Dead. Until I realized that I actually didn't really like either. I just thought I was supposed to.  Being a bong-making teenager gave me a shot at popularity. The shot missed, by the way. But bongs were and are and always will be a fun challenge, a tough marriage of form and function. How often do you work in clay these days? All the time. The pottery studio is still where I work out my ideas. My design practice is craft based: It's a digital world, but I'm an analog dude. Clay is my main medium and my forever love. Side note, I work in white stoneware and I wear white jeans every day so you can't see the clay splatters on my pants. Pottery studio; funerals; brises: white jeans only.  Now House seems very postmodern to me, recalling the pastel palette of that early-'80s moment. Is that what you were after? When I was coming up in the '80s, postmodernism was primarily aesthetic, not theoretical: this visual mash-up of ""no new tale to tell,"" the whole mix that comes from pulling references from any and all eras and recontextualizing them.  I hope I have a vast and considered knowledge of the past, present and future, and I put it all in my visual blender and see what unfolds. So yeah, there are some '80s references and some futuristic references. Some Werkstatte-y references like this … (Mr. Adler held up a tall mint green powder-coated metal vase with a grid of cutouts below the rim, $48.) This is a perfect example, very Josef Hoffman-y but reinvented in a minty package.  When I look at the Wink Box at home on my computer, Amazon suggests things that I might also like. These include a ""Dry Guy Boot Dryer,"" vacuum sealer rolls with a cutter box and an ""Alaska Bear"" natural silk pillowcase. I have no idea what these things are. Sounds like you are into some freaky stuff that involves wet boots, long-term food storage and, as for the silk pillowcase, I don't even want to speculate.  What was the brief for this collection? At the end of the day I'm still an applied artist. I'm trained to solve problems, like, ""O.K., What is Amazon? What does it need to be?"" It needs to be something you can see online. It needs to be stylish, and it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if it ended up on a lot of Instagram accounts. The prices need to be attractive, so I need to think about technique and materials. I'm a huge Amazon customer, obvs, who isn't? But I go to Amazon for needs. I think my most recent purchase was like cereal and a madeleine pan and batteries. Amazon wants to become the source for wants, so they came to me to be their first home collection [of designer furniture] which was very flattering and of course a chance to get back the money I've spent. Anything else you want to highlight? I'm really into terrazzo. It's kind of a trendy material. The idea of terrazzo architectural objets is a kind of highfalutin shelfscape thing. I thought it would be fun to take something that's typically done in plaster but do it in affordable terrazzo. Everything wends its way into myriad things.  This interview has been edited and condensed."
7,2018-11-14," Throughout its 14-month search for a second headquarters — which has concluded with the dual selection of Long Island City, Queens, and Arlington, Va. — Amazon talked of its need for things like transportation, housing and a business-friendly environment.  But did Amazon really select New York City for its transportation system? The subways are a shambles. The company couldn't have chosen New York for its affordable housing because, as in Seattle, there isn't any. As for outdoor recreation, our beaches and parks are jammed, our soccer fields overrun. There's a lot more green space elsewhere. Cost of living? Hardly a selling point, unless you are seeking to increase your operating expenses. And no, Amazon didn't choose New York because it has real bagels — although it couldn't hurt. Amazon wants to develop a four-million-square-foot campus by the East River because of the talent that resides in New York. Lots of it. According to the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, New York has more than 320,000 tech workers in the labor pool, the most in the nation. (Washington is second.) That talent commands high salaries, great benefits and won't move to Pittsburgh or Austin or any other of the perfectly nice cities that tried to woo the online giant. Which raises the question: If New York has what Amazon wants, why is it paying the company so much to make the move? Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who offered to replace his given name with the company's to land the deal, are doing a victory dance.  ""New York can proudly say that we have attracted one of the largest, most competitive economic development investments in U.S. history,"" Amazon Cuomo said. They seem to have done so by overpaying. Landlords and real estate developers can rejoice at the prospect of soaring property values and rents, and restaurateurs, craft brewers and kombucha makers will see new customers among the 25,000 jobholders with an average salary of $150,000 that Amazon promises to hire over 10 years. But the plan calls for the state to dispense $1.525 billion to the company, including $1.2 billion from its Excelsior program, which will reimburse Amazon $48,000 for every job. Another state agency, Empire State Development, will offer $325 million to the Amazonians tied to real estate projects. As for the city, Amazon can apply for tax credits that could be worth north of $1 billion from programs known as ICAP and REAP that reward companies for job creation generally, and outside Manhattan specifically. (And the campus is in a federal redevelopment area that qualifies for corporate tax breaks, letting the company's major stockholder, the world's richest man, keep more of his wealth.) Oh, and Amazon wants a helipad for its chief executive, Jeff Bezos. No problem. Cities that lost out to New York offered far more in financial incentives. But the Commonwealth of Virginia is spending a piddling $22,000 per job in the initial phase of development in Arlington, and payments will max out at $750 million if Amazon creates 37,850 jobs. The state is also throwing in $295 million in transportation improvements, including a bridge to nearby Reagan National Airport so Mr. Bezos can remain close to his copter. That's still less than half of what New Yorkers will be paying out.  The prospect of handing Long Island City over to a company recently valued at $1 trillion seems distorted to some Queens politicians. They sense gentrification by fiat — another neighborhood sacrificed to the tech elite. ""I welcome the jobs if it means Amazon investment in L.I.C. infrastructure, without us having to pay a ransom for them to be here,"" said the neighborhood's state senator, Michael Gianaris. That is, rather than the state and the city paying off Amazon, Amazon should be required to invest in the subways, schools and affordable housing. It could also be required to include job guarantees for lower-income residents of Long Island City, not just flimsy promises of job training. Nothing has been carved in stone yet. The agreement is a memorandum of understanding, not a binding contract. No final deal should be pushed through without public input or approval. The mayor and governor would benefit from soliciting ideas from New Yorkers themselves, both those who live in Long Island City, and the other taxpayers footing the bill for the generous subsidies about to be given to the company. It's distressing that a mayor and governor who can't come together for the sake of the subways or public housing somehow managed to find common ground by doing an end run around the City Council and steamrollering the land-use process. We won't know for 10 years whether the promised 25,000 jobs will materialize. We do know that for decades states and cities have paid ransoms in the tens of billions of dollars to attract or ""keep"" jobs only to find themselves at the losing end of the proposition when companies moved on after the taxpayer freebies ended. During the Great Recession, it became commonplace for the auto industry to abandon one community after another despite lining its pockets with government money. Job promises were left in the dust of bankruptcy. Even in better times, economists have made a convincing case that these job development payout schemes aren't worth it.  New York City has long played this incentives game to encourage companies to bring jobs here or expand. (The New York Times Company has been a beneficiary.) The mayor argues that the increase in net tax returns of $13.5 billion that Amazon will provide over 25 years is ample return on investment. But the requirements of job creation and retention now favor big cities such as New York. Throughout the world, such cities have become economic powerhouses because of their ability to concentrate the resources that global corporations increasingly need. The days when companies such as General Electric, IBM, AT&T and Mastercard fled the city for boring suburban campuses, where innovation goes to sleep, are over. Building infrastructure for Amazon's future benefit may be too generous a bargain for it to strike when there's a compelling need for housing and schools and transportation for all New Yorkers right now. Mr. Bezos has owned a home here for years. He knows what our city has to offer; and as the web's biggest retailer, he knows what he's getting in setting up shop in Long Island City: a discount. So welcome, Jeff. Hope you enjoy your helipad."
8,2018-11-14," You can understand why Chuck Lorre would want to go dark with his new series, ""The Kominsky Method,"" for Netflix. The serious half-hour is where the cool kids are hanging out these days: ""Homecoming"" and ""Transparent"" on Amazon, ""Atlanta"" and ""Better Things"" on FX, ""The Girlfriend Experience"" on Starz. And as the most successful sitcom creator around, with an almost unbroken 25-year string of hits that includes huge moneymakers like ""The Big Bang Theory"" and ""Two and a Half Men,"" Lorre has some leeway. A track record like that has to come in handy when you're pitching a show whose punch lines mostly deal with death, loneliness and incontinence. It also helps when you can get Alan Arkin and Michael Douglas — 16 and 41 years removed from their last regular television work — to play the aging frenemies at the heart of your story. Inevitability isn't a good argument for a TV show's existence, however. ""The Kominsky Method"" (eight episodes arrive Friday) isn't a disaster; it has a certain warm-bath appeal, if you don't mind a thick foam of prostate jokes. But it is adrift in a bland netherworld between Lorre's precision-tooled, laugh-a-minute network comedies and the quieter aesthetic of the alt-sitcom, lacking the strengths of either. Douglas stars as Sandy Kominsky, an acting coach of minor renown whose promising career as a performer never quite panned out. Thrice divorced, he runs his studio with the help of his long-suffering daughter, Mindy (Sarah Baker), dates his 20-something students and hangs out with his agent and apparently only friend, Norman Newlander (Arkin). [Read the Times profile about Michael Douglas and his return to television at age 74.] Putting Douglas in the role of a silver-haired Hollywood Lothario (his hair is fantastic) who chose integrity over stardom can be seen as a clever bit of casting, both for and against type. The real (unintentional) twist, though, is having him play an acting coach who pushes his students to be honest onstage — given that Douglas, in his highly successful career, has consistently given closed-off, impenetrable performances. The one really notable exception was his relaxed, completely convincing portrayal of the middle-aged writing teacher Grady Tripp in ""Wonder Boys"" (2000), and the scrambling, half-principled Sandy is a little like Grady 20 years down the road, without tenure. Douglas is clearly comfortable with Sandy, and his performance is amiable and easy to like. But it's not much more than that: As a showrunner and writer, Lorre (who gets full or partial writing credit on all eight episodes) hasn't done anything to raise Douglas's game. What he has given him are platitudes and attitudes, the outline of a well-meaning Peter Pan confronting mortality and isolation without the substance. A sitcom character, in other words. You could argue that this is the point: As Sandy skirts financial ruin and vacillates over his relationship to an ""age-appropriate"" woman (played by Nancy Travis, 17 years younger than Douglas), Norman frequently calls him out on his shallowness. But those observations aren't insights so much as obligatory comic beats. Moving into single-camera naturalism, Lorre carries with him the structures and comic sensibilities of the multicamera network sitcom — he just slows the pace, stretching out the setups, and ratchets down the jokes, as if explosive laughs would be unseemly in these quieter surroundings. The show's sensibility is also decidedly retrograde and fueled by Hollywood nostalgia, which can be appealing when Sandy and Norman are meeting for lunch at Musso & Frank Grill but unappetizing in the scenes at Sandy's studio, where nearly every scene mocks the naïveté and political correctness of the young students. And while the bromance of Sandy and Norman is the heart of the show, the masculinity-in-moth-balls atmosphere can be overpowering. If you're a man who hasn't heard of retrograde ejaculation, you'll Google to see if it's a real thing, after which you'll feel a little sick to your stomach. Particularly egregious is the treatment of Norman's daughter, a pill-popping head case played by Lisa Edelstein who shows up for a few episodes to vex her poor father and is completely forgotten once she is dropped off at rehab. Norman, who experiences a tragic early loss and grows progressively morose and antisocial, is a bum part. But Arkin, still bringing sharp wit to aggravation and aggrievement, is the best thing about ""The Kominsky Method,"" even when the writing takes Norman into kvetching ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" territory. If you have to listen to someone complain about the modern world (""Skype — what a stupid word""), it might as well be him."

James Corden razzed Amazon on Tuesday for the anticlimactic news that it would set up new headquarters in New York and the Washington metro area. After a long decision-making process that saw cities across the United States vying for Amazon's selection, the tech giant announced that it was going with two of the most obvious options. Stephen Colbert welcomed the news that Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat, had won the Arizona Senate race. But he poked fun at the senator-elect for her reputation as a pragmatist and a centrist. Trevor Noah showed a picture of a group of high-school boys in Wisconsin that made headlines after circulating on social media. In the photo, taken earlier this year before a high school prom, almost every one of the more than 60 boys is shown giving what appears to be a Nazi salute. Jimmy Kimmel turned 51 on Tuesday. A random Seattle woman has been holding a party to celebrate Kimmel's big day for years. She's not really a fan — she just needed an excuse to party one day, and an annual tradition was born.

10,2018-11-14,"  (Want to get New York Today by email? Here's the sign-up.) It's Wednesday. 💰Who won? Powerball will present a New York record $343.8 million check today to a Harlem man for the Oct. 27 drawing. Weather: Sunny but chilly, with a high of 39. First freeze tonight: down into the 20s. And a messy mix of snow, sleet and rain tomorrow. Winter's coming. New: It's official. Amazon will open a major office in Long Island City, Queens, and another in Virginia. A third, smaller one, will open in Tennessee. What Amazon got: At least $1.7 billion in tax incentives from New York State. And a helipad, because, well, have you seen the subways in New York? What Amazon will provide: 25,000 jobs, eventually (or supposedly). When: Mayor de Blasio, who courted Amazon, said New York ""is about to"" get those jobs. But the credit agency Fitch Ratings said the impact will be more muted. [Daily News] Where: Long Island City, ""next to the largest public housing unit in the country,"" the mayor said. ""The synergy is going to be extraordinary."" Or it could turn out to be a glaring example of the growing divide between ascending and struggling communities. (Perhaps the Mr. de Blasio of 2013 would call it a tale of two cities.) The opposition: Critics say a giant company owned by the richest man on the planet shouldn't get tax breaks or incentives to move here. Where else can they go? Not many other cities can absorb a move of this size. Can it be blocked?: Unlikely because the deal is being arranged through a state agency under Governor Cuomo's control. Still, court challenges are likely. Because this is New York. The politics: It's a tale of two progressives, as The Times's Eliza Shapiro noted. On one side is Mr. de Blasio, who has worked to keep Walmart stores out of New York and often decries the influence of money. In July, we wrote a story headlined, ""Bill de Blasio Is a Progressive. But Is He Progressive Enough?"" On the opposing side is the congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of the Bronx and Queens (though her district does not include Long Island City). She has spoken out against the deal. The Onion's take: ""New York City Announces Subway Just For Amazon Employees Now"" From The Times's William Neuman at City Hall: With a huge turnout expected for Election Day, you might have thought that the Board of Elections would have placed as many ballot scanners as possible at its 1,200 polling places. But even as scanners were jamming all around town, causing lengthy delays, the board had about 1,000 scanning machines in storage, election officials said on Tuesday. Michael Ryan, the executive director of the board, said it ""deployed"" about 4,000 scanners. The board owns more than 5,000. A Manhattan board member, Frederic M. Umane, tried to explain why. He said the redesign and relocation in recent years of many polling sites to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act had reduced the space available to set up machines — and that the board therefore could not have distributed more of them. New: The new half-fare MetroCards for low-income riders will be available only for 7-day or 30-day passes, The Times's Emma Fitzsimmons reported. Catch up: After resisting the plan initially, Mayor de Blasio included the Fair Fares program in this year's city budget. It starts in January. Analysis: The Times's Nikita Stewart: ""A lot of people don't just live check to check; they live day to day. Buying a seven-day and 30-day pass can be upending if lost and takes a bigger chunk of money than $2.75 and $3 for the day."" New: City leaders of the Working Families Party voted Tuesday to endorse Jumaane Williams for public advocate, my colleague Jeff Mays reports. The vote gives Mr. Williams, a Brooklyn city councilman, a leg up in what is expected to be a crowded nonpartisan election this winter that could have 10 or more candidates. (If you'll recall, the outgoing public advocate, Letitia James, was just elected state attorney general.) The vote: Mr. Williams racked up 414,000 votes in the city during his unsuccessful run for lieutenant governor while working with the Working Families Party. Why it matters: It is expected to be a low turnout election. With volunteers on the ground, coordinating a small-donor campaign — Mr. Williams has never been a prolific fund-raiser — the group's support can be invaluable. At the trial of the notorious druglord, his lawyer argued El Chapo is not the mastermind behind the murderous Sinaloa cartel as prosecutors claim, but ""a scapegoat.""

11,2018-11-14," Good Wednesday. Want this by email? Sign up here. Amazon confirmed yesterday that it had picked New York City and Northern Virginia for its new hubs. (Nashville will get a logistics facility as a consolation prize.) But skeptics are asking whether the price tag — a combined total of $2 billion in tax credits, rebates and other incentives — was worth it. Here's what each location promised: • New York offered Amazon more than $1.2 billion in incentives, and a pledge that Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio would stop bickering long enough to see the project through. The city also agreed to a helipad for Jeff Bezos. • Virginia promised about $800 million in incentives (and the all-important helipad, too). It also rebranded the neighborhoods that will host Amazon's office as ""National Landing."" Officials from each location said that Amazon's offices would create at least 25,000 jobs. But critics say the incentives set a worrying precedent: Bryce Covert writes in an NYT Op-Ed that other companies will now expect similarly extravagant windfalls in exchange for offices. And some local politicians have already publicly opposed the plan. Meanwhile, Shira Ovide of Bloomberg Opinion thinks Amazon may have outsmarted itself: ""The year of hoopla during a period of deepening anxiety about powerful technology companies means there will be more attention on whether Amazon is a good corporate citizen."" More tech job news: Amazon and Google are in a race to hire software developers. British and European Union officials reached a long-awaited draft agreement yesterday over Britain's withdrawal from the bloc. Now comes the hard part. At 2 p.m. today (9 a.m. Eastern), Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain will meet with senior cabinet ministers to assess the plans. They reviewed the draft text overnight, though the details haven't been made public. Getting to this point has not been easy, and it involved months of labored discussions — particularly about contentious issues like the Irish border. But Stephen Castle of the NYT points out how pivotal today's meeting is: If the deal is rejected today, Mrs. May's leadership could hang in the balance. If it passes, it still requires approval by E.U. officials at a meeting in Brussels later this month — and would then be subject to a highly unpredictable Parliament vote. Follow how events play out today in the NYT's live briefing. More Brexit news: The departure could leave wedding bouquets stuck at the British border. But the supercar manufacturer McLaren is, unusually, increasing production capacity in Britain. The price of oil continued to slide this morning, with Brent crude hitting $65 a barrel in London after falling 6.6 percent yesterday. There may be some technical trading issues at work here. But fundamentally, the markets worry that there's too much oil. ""When you put all these ingredients together, you have a recipe that's not really conducive to an $85 market environment,"" Michael Cohen, an oil analyst at Barclays, told the FT. Oil's drop has already had an effect on the stock markets, with energy stocks dragging down the S&P 500 yesterday, and that could worsen today. But there's one potential upside for investors: Falling oil prices and a strengthening U.S. dollar may convince the Fed to pause its interest rate increases. Jay Powell discusses the U.S. and the global economy. A Q. and A. with the Fed chairman, organized by the Dallas Fed (watch it here at 6 p.m. Eastern), could provide hints about the central bank's future monetary policy. The Labor Department publishes October consumer price data. The Consumer Price Index rose by just 0.1 percent in September, suggesting that inflation was being kept in check. Analysts anticipate a 0.3 percent rise for October. The Japanese conglomerate will invest $3 billion in WeWork, giving the co-working start-up more money to expand — even as its losses continue to grow. SoftBank's new cash solidifies its status as WeWork's single biggest financial backer, and gives the eight-year-old start-up a valuation of at least $42 billion. More important, it will help the company offer more desks for rent around the world. The cash comes at a crucial time: WeWork disclosed that it had lost $1.22 billion so far this year. The company says it still needs to spend on growth, but it could eventually focus on turning a profit. If, or when, it decides to go public, that could become vital. CNN filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration yesterday, arguing that its withholding of press credentials for the correspondent Jim Acosta violated the Constitution. More from Mike Grynbaum of the NYT: The Trump administration plans to fight back. But Floyd Abrams, a First Amendment lawyer who represented the NYT during the Pentagon Papers case, told Politico, ""I can't think of anything that is likely to lead to a victory for the White House."" Yet Noah Feldman of Bloomberg Opinion says that, politically, Mr. Trump has already won by undercutting the news media. The National Defense Strategy Commission said in a report published yesterday that the ""security and well-being of the United States are at greater risk than at any time in decades."" The panel urged Congress to act: The commission noted that authoritarian nations like China and Russia were seeking ""the means to project power globally,"" and added that ""the proliferation of advanced technology is allowing more actors to contest U.S. military power in more threatening ways."" Its report suggested a number of priorities for Congress. Its conclusion: ""Innovations in operational concepts and leap-ahead technologies are vital to sustaining U.S. military advantages"" in the long term.

12,2018-11-14," After 14 months of pitches, meetings and offers of incentives and name changes, Amazon announced on Tuesday that its second headquarters would be on two sites: one in Long Island City, Queens, and another in Arlington, Va. The company is also developing a smaller operations and logistics facility in Nashville.  Here are some details you might have missed in all the coverage: Company executives flew to New York just to establish that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio could put aside their longstanding differences.  Although the two have clashed on everything from the subway to handling deer, they were all smiles on Tuesday. ""I know him so well, it's just more open and verbal,"" Mr. Cuomo said. ""Whether it's good or bad.""  Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, will be able to come to work by flying over the East River — where kayakers now bob. Office buildings will rise and make room for 25,000 workers. How can this happen so fast? The state and city will bypass City Council, which has the power to block rezoning and land use measures. New York's leaders have also agreed to remake the Queens waterfront, move a distribution center for school lunches, and provide a package of $1.7 billion in incentives from the state and hundreds of millions more from the city.  He already owns a huge home near the Arlington site — a former textile museum in the wealthy Kalorama neighborhood in Northwest Washington, D.C., just a few miles away. But he did not tour — and has not yet toured — that site or Queens. Company executives ran the selection process in both states.  Amazon's offices will spill over into parts of the Pentagon City neighborhood and Alexandria. Local officials rebranded the two-and-a-half-mile urban stretch, connected by three Metro subway stations along the Potomac, as a new neighborhood and called it National Landing.  It will rejuvenate a place filled with dated office buildings developed in the 1970s for military contractors. Some of that space has been sitting empty since the Pentagon reorganized after the Sept. 11 attacks.  The rebranding has already sparked conversation on social media. Mr. Cuomo said he was doing everything that he could to lure Amazon in.  ""I'll change my name to Amazon Cuomo if that's what it takes,"" Mr. Cuomo said. ""Because it would be a great economic boost.""  It will take about one million square feet in the 50-story Citicorp building on Long Island City. There was debate over whether the company would replace the Citi logo, which is visible from Manhattan. But Amazon is not interested in a sign. Alicia Glen, the deputy mayor for economic development, pointed out that the area is known as Anable Basin, ""I'm guessing they're going to call it Amazon Basin.""  What do you give a man who is one of the world wealthiest people? Business leaders in Tucson tried to mail Mr. Bezos a 21-foot cactus. The plant was returned — it would have suffered in the Seattle rain anyway. The mayor of Frisco, Tex., offered the chance of getting a Jamba Juice and catching the ""Frisco Flu."" Canada's offering was just Canada.  As noted above, New York promised Amazon at least $1.7 billion in incentives. Virginia promised incentives worth $573 million, including $550 million in cash grants.  Economists have long criticized tax incentives as inefficient and unnecessary measures that leave less money for education and public works. Altogether, the two locations offered more than $2 billion in tax credits, rebates and other incentives to Amazon.  Bryce Covert, a contributing opinion writer, also notes that the lucrative deals being given to Amazon may mean that other cities will expect similar treatment when they try to set up shop.  In New York, the company will be a stone's throw from Queensbridge Houses, the largest public housing complex in the United States. The buildings are home to a mostly black and Hispanic population with a median household income well below the federal poverty level. Local residents have expressed worry that jobs at Amazon would not be open to them. Amazon has promised training and internship programs and to participate in job fairs at the housing complex. New companies in Long Island City are already transforming the semi-industrial waterfront area and are drawing in moneyed professionals, raising concerns that more intense gentrification will drive up costs."
13,2018-11-14," Here is what was on view on Election Day in Jonathan Adler's company headquarters on Hudson Street in Manhattan: a bit of Brutalism; lots of organic modernism (of the sort once seen in 1960s-era Reform synagogues); a dash of Egyptian revival (but the '70s version); scenes from the Memphis movement; references to pre-Columbian pottery, and to early '80s disco tropes and Pop Art; many, many objects emblazoned with marijuana leaves (including a stunning beaded and embroidered textile that read ""Weed"" in a medley of greens); and an elderly and very grumpy Chihuahua atop a lavender towel on a shredded lime-colored chair. Trained in semiotics and art history at Brown, Mr. Adler has long been known for his exuberant style that is also a big tent of references. It was nearly 30 years ago that the designer, now 52, made a line of quilted pottery inspired by Chanel bags, and 20 years ago that he opened his first home store on Broome Street.  His company now has 17 stores worldwide, a wholesale and e-commerce business, and a residential and commercial design practice. Last month, Mr. Adler introduced a collection for Amazon called Now House: whimsical objects and furniture in mod black and white and postmodern pastels. Delivery is free and speedy with an Amazon Prime membership.  A stoneware ""Wink Box,"" shaped like an eye, is $30 and can be to you the day after tomorrow; a Josef sideboard, honey-colored wood with a whorled pattern on its doors ($798), will take a little longer. Below, he answered some pressing questions. Before we get to that collection, what's this tray of ashtrays and vessels printed with red lips and joints and marijuana leaves? It's an exclusive for a pot store called Higher Standards, a capsule collection. I always say, ""Live clean and decorate dirty."" I don't smoke or do any drugs, but you can get a decorative dirty frisson. But you used to? When I was a teen, I started making bongs. That was the great thing about being a potter. You could make bongs. I used to smoke a lot of pot and listen to a lot of Grateful Dead. Until I realized that I actually didn't really like either. I just thought I was supposed to.  Being a bong-making teenager gave me a shot at popularity. The shot missed, by the way. But bongs were and are and always will be a fun challenge, a tough marriage of form and function. How often do you work in clay these days? All the time. The pottery studio is still where I work out my ideas. My design practice is craft based: It's a digital world, but I'm an analog dude. Clay is my main medium and my forever love. Side note, I work in white stoneware and I wear white jeans every day so you can't see the clay splatters on my pants. Pottery studio; funerals; brises: white jeans only.  Now House seems very postmodern to me, recalling the pastel palette of that early-'80s moment. Is that what you were after? When I was coming up in the '80s, postmodernism was primarily aesthetic, not theoretical: this visual mash-up of ""no new tale to tell,"" the whole mix that comes from pulling references from any and all eras and recontextualizing them.  I hope I have a vast and considered knowledge of the past, present and future, and I put it all in my visual blender and see what unfolds. So yeah, there are some '80s references and some futuristic references. Some Werkstatte-y references like this … (Mr. Adler held up a tall mint green powder-coated metal vase with a grid of cutouts below the rim, $48.) This is a perfect example, very Josef Hoffman-y but reinvented in a minty package.  When I look at the Wink Box at home on my computer, Amazon suggests things that I might also like. These include a ""Dry Guy Boot Dryer,"" vacuum sealer rolls with a cutter box and an ""Alaska Bear"" natural silk pillowcase. I have no idea what these things are. Sounds like you are into some freaky stuff that involves wet boots, long-term food storage and, as for the silk pillowcase, I don't even want to speculate.  What was the brief for this collection? At the end of the day I'm still an applied artist. I'm trained to solve problems, like, ""O.K., What is Amazon? What does it need to be?"" It needs to be something you can see online. It needs to be stylish, and it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if it ended up on a lot of Instagram accounts. The prices need to be attractive, so I need to think about technique and materials. I'm a huge Amazon customer, obvs, who isn't? But I go to Amazon for needs. I think my most recent purchase was like cereal and a madeleine pan and batteries. Amazon wants to become the source for wants, so they came to me to be their first home collection [of designer furniture] which was very flattering and of course a chance to get back the money I've spent. Anything else you want to highlight? I'm really into terrazzo. It's kind of a trendy material. The idea of terrazzo architectural objets is a kind of highfalutin shelfscape thing. I thought it would be fun to take something that's typically done in plaster but do it in affordable terrazzo. Everything wends its way into myriad things.  This interview has been edited and condensed."
14,2018-11-14," In 2003, Craig Nevill-Manning, a computer scientist at Google, wanted to set up an engineering outpost in New York. Google's top leaders were skeptical, but they told him that he could go ahead if he could find 15 ""Google-worthy"" software developers in the city. ""The attitude was that pretty much all the good software engineers were in Silicon Valley,"" Mr. Nevill-Manning recalled. ""It seems crazy in retrospect."" Mr. Nevill-Manning found his developers and opened the engineering office in New York. Today, Google employs 7,000 people in the city, and more than half are engineers and technical staff. The Google story mirrors the rise and evolution of New York as a genuine tech hub — home to a deep pool of technical talent as well as sales, marketing and business expertise. And Amazon's decision to put a headquarters in the city, eventually employing more than 25,000 workers, only reinforces that trend. [Do you live or work near Amazon's proposed new headquarters in Queens, N.Y., or Arlington, Va.? We want to hear from you.] ""This solidifies New York's importance and significance in tech,"" said Fred Wilson, the dean of New York's venture capital community and co-founder of Union Square Ventures. Amazon, like most big tech companies, is no stranger to New York. It already has over 2,000 workers in New York, from e-commerce marketers to cloud computing engineers. Facebook has over 2,000 New York employees, including Yann LeCun, its chief artificial intelligence scientist and a pioneer in the field. Salesforce employs more than 1,000 at its new offices in New York. And tech stalwart IBM chose the city as the headquarters for its Watson artificial intelligence and cloud computing divisions. Most technology work in New York has traditionally been in service of other industries. That market, too, is growing briskly as banks, retailers, advertising and consulting firms — major employers in New York — are all getting digital makeovers and hiring. Goldman Sachs, for example, employs 2,000 tech workers in New York, including data analysts, app developers, digital security and blockchain experts. Manuela Veloso, head of the machine-learning department at Carnegie Mellon University, joined JPMorgan Chase this year to lead its A.I. research team. The five companies with the most tech-related job listings in New York over the last three months on Indeed.com, the jobs listing site, are Amazon, BNY Mellon, Capgemini, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley. Measurements of tech sector jobs vary, depending on definitions. But the broad picture is a growing labor market for well-paying jobs. From 2010 to 2017, according to government statistics, tech sector employment grew by 53,000 in the city, or 65 percent, to an estimated 134,700. And the average salary of $147,300 in 2016, the most recent estimate available, was far higher than the citywide average of $89,100 for all private employers. The Bay Area, to be sure, remains the nation's high-tech epicenter. New York is growing impressively, but its tech work force, according to most analyses, is less than half and perhaps one-third that of the Bay Area. New York fairly consistently ranks second behind the Bay Area in attracting venture capital. In the third quarter, for example, investors put $5.9 billion in start-ups in the New York metropolitan area, according to figures compiled by the PwC-CB Insights MoneyTree Report. But the Bay Area, including San Francisco and Silicon Valley, took in $12.8 billion. Start-ups in the Washington, D.C. region, where Amazon plans to put another large headquarters, received $575 million in the third quarter. In the past, New York start-ups typically sold out to larger tech companies. That, too, is changing. Mr. Wilson, the venture capitalist, pointed to MongoDB, a database supplier, and Etsy, an e-commerce seller, as examples of start-ups that held out and went public in recent years. MongoDB trades at about $70 a share, compared with its initial price of $24 a share, when it went public in October 2017. Etsy, which went public at $16 a share in 2015, currently trades at about $47 a share. ""New York entrepreneurs, investors and boards are just starting to get the courage to stay independent and grow here,"" Mr. Wilson said. The rise of New York's tech sector, businesspeople and technologists agree, owes a debt to former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. He pushed initiatives to make the New York economy less dependent on finance and championed tech programs and education — a long-term campaign to upgrade the technical skills of the city's work force, whose progress enhanced New York's appeal to Amazon. After the financial crisis hit in 2008, Mr. Bloomberg stepped up those efforts. In 2010, his administration announced an applied sciences competition. The city solicited proposals from universities and research organizations for a new center of higher education that would focus on technology, innovation and business. The winner, announced in December 2011, was a joint plan by Cornell University and the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. The new institution, Cornell Tech, got underway in Manhattan in 2012, and last year moved into three buildings in its first phase of development on Roosevelt Island. There are now 300 graduate students on campus. Over the next two decades, the plan calls for two million square feet of buildings, a student population of 2,000 and hundreds of faculty. Daniel Huttenlocher, the dean of Cornell Tech, sits on Amazon's board. The prospect of new competition served as a prod — and encouragement — to both Columbia University and New York University. Columbia expanded its engineering and computer science programs, and created the Data Science Institute. N.Y.U. absorbed an engineering school, Polytechnic University, which in 2015 became N.Y.U.'s Tandon School of Engineering. N.Y.U. also took over an old, unused Metropolitan Transportation Authority building in Brooklyn, renovated it and has begun populating it with tech-fueled research ventures, starting with the Center for Urban Science and Progress. For technologists who have recently come to New York, part of its appeal is the same thing that explains why its tech sector is often overlooked: New York's huge and diverse economy, and its culture. ""Everything is tech-driven on the West Coast,"" said Jeannette Wing, who left Microsoft Research last year to become the director of Columbia's Data Science Institute. ""But the East Coast is more well rounded. It is about technology, but not just technology for its own sake."""
15,2018-11-14," [What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] In the days before Amazon's official announcement that it would situate its second headquarters in two locations, one of them in Queens, many New Yorkers were outraged by the impending incursion as they surely went about ordering their slow-cookers and folding chairs and heavily discounted copies of ""Friday Black"" from the company, for expedited delivery. The holidays, after all, are approaching. I count myself among the hypocrites. Along with so many others who think about urbanism, I spent much of Monday ruminating on the paradox of a company with a trillion-dollar valuation receiving billions of dollars in tax credits for bringing high-paying, technocratic jobs to a place already full of them. During the last decade, the city has added 76,000 tech jobs. In September, New York State recorded its lowest unemployment rate in 30 years. And yet Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo went after Amazon as if he were the desperate patriarch in a 19th-century novel, ready to balloon the family dowry without limit all for the prospect of ensuring that his daughter marry up, even if, in truth, she stood at the pinnacle and could have anyone. Was it really necessary that Amazon get its own helipad when there is one right across the river? Exhausted at the injustice, I tucked into bed at the end of the day with my iPad and streamed the second segment of ""The Worricker Trilogy"" on Amazon Prime, barely registering the contradiction. [What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] We have internalized our use of Amazon to such a degree that we have trouble recognizing our complicity in the manufacture of the company's own arrogance. Last year, I witnessed an adult ask an 8-year old if he believed in Santa, to which the child replied, rolling his eyes, ""Santa is Amazon."" The company will arrive in Long Island City at a time when whole blocks in Manhattan and Brooklyn are distinguished by their empty storefronts, a consequence largely of rising commercial rents but also of the submission to fatigue over principle that occurs every time someone who genuinely believes in the importance of a thriving local merchant class shops by refusing to leave the house. While theoretically Amazon might have established a fund to help the world of small businesses it has managed to destabilize, the company did not offer and, perhaps more tellingly, the city made no such demand. Instead the company will provide space on its new campus for artists and nascent entrepreneurs, which further aligns it with an image of urbane creativity that nearly every tech company seeks to maintain. In corporate philanthropy, self-interest is nearly always clasping the hand of largess. Will the arrival of Amazon really be a boon to Queensbridge, the vast public housing complex, nearby, as Bill de Blasio seems to believe? (""The synergy,"" as he put it, ""is going to be extraordinary."") The company has agreed to spend $5 million on job-training programs and internships and to participate in job fairs for a few years. But even if that were deemed sufficient, these developments would unfold within the context of the significant pay gap that plagues the technology industry in New York. Two years ago, research from the Association for Neighborhood Housing and Development found that Latinos earned, on average, two-thirds of what their white counterparts did, and blacks made half as much. Beyond that, in choosing New York and suburban Washington over the Pittsburghs and Denvers that Amazon had said it was considering, it already made its elitist commitments very clear. It would not be seduced by the notion of experimentation; it would go where it was most likely that standing in line at a CVS at 7 in the evening, you would run into someone from the Harvard class of 2004. The second decade of the 21st century has been a golden period in the history of American urbanism, as midsize cities have undergone a renaissance, with cities like San Antonio growing at a faster rate than places like Los Angeles or Boston. This is the outcome, to some extent, of the affordability crisis in major American cities and the dispersal of cultural capital that has come with it. Once moribund downtown neighborhoods in Birmingham, Ala., or Providence, R.I., for example, are full of new galleries, theaters, restaurants, businesses. Perhaps the most dispiriting aspect of Amazon's search process and its result is that it chose not to join that narrative, to further stimulate the engines of growth. (As part of its announcement this week the company said it would open a smaller operations facility in Nashville, but honestly, isn't that like winning the steak knives when you really wanted the Buick?) The average salary for jobs at the new Amazon headquarters will be $150,000, the company has said. In Indianapolis it would go quite far; in New York City, that wouldn't disqualify you for a housing subsidy. On Tuesday afternoon, various politicians and business leaders issued statements testifying to their delight in Amazon's decision. Among them was Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor who gave us the framework for the vertical city both literally and figuratively — a city of high-tech skyscrapers and top-down governance that laid to rest whatever communitarian ambitions and Jane Jacobs fever dreams remained. Amazon is coming to New York without the input of the City Council or the community in which the company will find itself. They were to be quiet and grateful."

17,2018-11-14," There are wine bars and a cycling studio along the riverfront in Long Island City, among gleaming high-rise apartment buildings with views of Midtown Manhattan. The soon-to-open library branch is a modern art cube of concrete, the median income is $138,000 a year, and America's hottest online retailer is about to move in. In the eyes of the federal government, the census tract that will house Amazon's new headquarters in New York is an ""opportunity zone,"" eligible for tax credits meant to spur investment in low-income communities. The retail giant said Tuesday that it had selected this upscale slice of Long Island City to house one of two new secondary headquarters. The decision was based on a host of factors, including state tax incentives and, in Amazon's words, the ability to attract top talent. But the choice could give eager developers — who almost certainly would have flocked to the area anyway — a tax benefit conveyed by a provision in the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul that President Trump signed last year. [Do you live or work near Amazon's proposed new headquarters in Queens, N.Y., or Arlington, Va.? We want to hear from you.] That tax break was pitched as a benefit for distressed communities. But critics fear it could primarily help wealthy investors and speed gentrification in parts of the United States that were already likely to draw investment. Opportunity zones have been championed for several years by Republicans and Democrats in Congress, and they were added to the tax law by Senator Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican. The zones allow investors who comply with regulations still being worked out by the Treasury Department to reduce their tax burden with preferential treatment of capital gains. Investors who pour unrealized capital gains into funds that invest in real estate or other assets that qualify for opportunity zone status can essentially avoid as much as 15 percent of the taxes they would have owed on their investment gains. If they hold an investment in an opportunity zone for more than a decade, they avoid all taxes on any gains that the investment produces. Amazon itself could benefit from the designation: It could start an opportunity fund to buy real estate in the zones surrounding the office, for example. But experts say the bigger windfall will flow to the people who already own land in the zone or other zones nearby, and to the investors who will race in to build and open businesses in the area. There are already signs of a mad dash for land in the area. New York gave Amazon up to $1.7 billion in state economic incentives to help secure its location in Queens. The agreement between the company and city and state officials does not mention the opportunity zone designation. Spokesmen for Amazon and the State of New York, which designated the waterfront tract of Long Island City as an opportunity zone this year, did not respond to requests for comment about the designation and how or whether it might have been a factor in the company's decision about where to locate. The vast majority of opportunity zones nationwide sit in areas of high poverty and low income, in struggling cities like Stockton, Calif. Other impoverished corners of Long Island City were also selected for zone status, including the census tract that is home to Queensbridge Houses, the nation's largest public housing project, where the poverty rate is near 50 percent and the median income below $20,000 a year. The waterfront Long Island City zone, in contrast, embodies what critics have worried might happen when place-based tax benefits extend to investment in areas that most Americans would not consider impoverished. ""The opportunity zone program is not very targeted to deeply distressed areas,"" the Brookings Institution researchers Hilary Gelfond and Adam Looney wrote in a recent study. ""States had too much flexibility and their incentives were not aligned with Congress's goals for the program."" The program's architects say that there are few tracts nationwide like the ones surrounding Amazon's new home, and that Long Island City will not divert investment from more distressed areas that lack a new high-tech tenant. ""It's not just that the Long Island City tract is an outlier,"" said John Lettieri, president of the Economic Innovation Group, a Washington think tank that helped advocate the creation of opportunity zones. ""It's the fact that Amazon, and this HQ2 thing, is an outlier. I don't think those are the cases that are going to define the national experience for opportunity zones."" The zones are meant to draw investment to economically struggling areas that lack access to capital. Wealthy investors are rushing to set up funds to plow money into those areas, in order to take advantage of incentives that include potentially large reductions in capital gains taxes for investments that are held in a zone for a decade or more. State governors selected the zones from a list of eligible census tracts, based on a formula used to calculate eligibility for another federal effort to aid struggling areas, the longstanding New Markets Tax Credit. Governors were allowed to designate one-quarter of eligible areas as opportunity zones. Their designations were approved by the Treasury Department. Most of the zones are in areas that have fallen behind economically, despite robust growth across the American economy. Ms. Gelfond and Mr. Looney calculated that the average poverty rate in a designated zone was 29 percent in 2016, nearly twice the national average. The zones are more heavily disadvantaged than the eligible areas that governors did not select, they found, and generally target areas where economic mobility is low. In other words, states did largely select areas that were truly in need of investment and economic help. But the relatively broad criteria allowed governors to choose some low-poverty, higher-income, rapidly developing areas adjacent to low-income zones. They constitute about 200 of the nearly 8,800 zones that Treasury approved, including the waterfront area that Amazon has chosen in Long Island City. Brookings estimated that 11 percent of the final opportunity zones have lower poverty rates than the national average. A third of the zones in Washington, D.C., for instance, are already gentrifying quickly, according to estimates by the Urban Institute. Among the states, New York has the highest share of gentrifying areas, with 13 percent of its zones in areas that are beginning to prosper. Areas like Long Island City ""are already getting a lot of capital,"" said Brett Theodos, a principal research associate in the Metropolitan Housing and Communities Policy Center at the Urban Institute. ""This use case was allowed from the beginning. Whether that's a good use of public subsidies is another question."" After Mr. Trump's tax cut passed, Mr. Theodos developed a ranking system of sorts to help states steer their designations toward areas that most needed the help. The system assigns each eligible tract in every state an ""investment score,"" which measures commercial, small-business and housing lending activity on a scale of 1 to 10 based on the need for investment. It also attaches ""socioeconomic change flags"" to areas that appear to be gentrifying, based on recent upswings in median income, housing costs and the share of residents who have college degrees or are white. The riverfront tract in Long Island City scored a 9 on that investment scale, and was flagged for gentrification."
18,2018-11-14," Amazon built a retail empire on low prices and free shipping. But for taxpayers, its new headquarters didn't come cheap. New York and Virginia collectively offered more than $2 billion in tax credits, rebates and other incentives to attract the company. That figure doesn't include what could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars in infrastructure spending, worker training and other government assistance. Economists have long criticized tax incentives as inefficient and unnecessary, arguing that they pit cities or states against each other and leave less money for education and public works that ultimately do more to lift local economies and improve livelihoods. Research has shown that incentives play at most a small role in corporate decisions, meaning governments often end up paying businesses to do what they would have done anyway. Indeed, in selecting New York and Virginia for its new locations, Amazon turned down seemingly richer offers just next door. Maryland and New Jersey each offered multibillion-dollar incentive packages that dwarfed the ones Amazon accepted. ""An additional $7.5 billion in subsidies wasn't enough to get Amazon to move across the river,"" said Michael Farren, an economist at the Mercatus Center, a libertarian think tank, referring to the difference between Maryland's offer of $8.5 billion and Virginia's of less than $1 billion. ""That just says that subsidies were never what mattered in the first place."" [Do you live or work near Amazon's proposed new headquarters in Queens, N.Y., or Arlington, Va.? We want to hear from you.] In its announcement on Tuesday, Amazon said that ""attracting top talent was the leading driver"" of its decision. Incentives were ""one factor,"" it said, but a secondary one. New York's incentive package is much larger than Virginia's. Amazon promised to create about 25,000 jobs at each location, but New York offered twice as much as Virginia did. ""That's the first thing we said,"" said Maria Doulis, vice president of the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission, which has offices in New York City and Albany. ""We're like, 'Wait, you're splitting this down the middle — why does it look like we're paying so much?' "" New York promised Amazon $1.525 billion in incentives, including $1.2 billion over the next 10 years as part of the state's Excelsior tax credit. The state also pledged to help Amazon with infrastructure upgrades, job-training programs and even assistance ""securing access to a helipad"" — none of which came with a price tag. Virginia promised Amazon an incentive package worth $573 million, including $550 million in cash grants — $22,000 per job. The state also pledged $250 million to help Virginia Tech build a campus in Alexandria, near the Amazon site in Arlington, offering degrees in computer science and software engineering. (Virginia, too, offered to help the company get a helipad.) New York has a history of offering generous incentive packages, including a 2007 deal for subsidized electricity to keep an Alcoa plant that was worth $5.6 billion over 30 years, according to Good Jobs First, which tracks corporate subsidies. On a per-job basis, New York's offer to Amazon is about typical for the state but well above the national average for such deals, said Timothy J. Bartik, an economist for the Upjohn Institute in Kalamazoo, Mich., who has studied tax incentives. ""New York's following its usual practices,"" Mr. Bartik said. ""It hands out a lot of hefty incentives, a lot of long-term incentives."" Gov. Andrew Cuomo defended the deal, arguing that New York has to offer incentives because of its comparatively high taxes. At 6.5 percent, New York's corporate income-tax rate is only modestly higher than Virginia's 6 percent, according to the Tax Foundation. But other business and individual taxes are higher in New York. ""It's not a level playing field to begin with,"" Mr. Cuomo said in an interview Tuesday. ""All things being equal, if we do nothing, they're going to Texas."" Amazon's New York site could also qualify for federal tax breaks under the tax law passed by Republicans late late year. That law created a program to encourage development in so-called opportunity zones, including parts of Long Island City. New York City did not offer any special tax breaks to Amazon as part of the deal. But the company will be able to take advantage of existing city tax credits, including a program designed to encourage companies to create jobs outside the busiest parts of Manhattan. The program, open to all companies, could be worth as much as $900 million to Amazon over 12 years, on top of the state incentives. Ms. Doulis, of the Citizens Budget Commission, said that credit and similar ones might have outlived their usefulness. In the 1980s and '90s, she said, companies were taking a risk by expanding in Queens or Brooklyn, and tax breaks provided an important inducement. But today, Long Island City is a rapidly developing neighborhood full of hip bars and luxury apartment complexes. ""That neighborhood was very different 25 years ago,"" she said. ""We're in a very different world now."" Still, Ms. Doulis said Amazon's arrival was a major coup for the city, which has been trying to establish itself as a tech hub to rival Boston, Seattle and even Silicon Valley. Mr. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio on Tuesday said Amazon's decision was a vindication of that strategy, which the mayor said would benefit all New Yorkers. Tom Stringer, who advises companies on site-selection decisions for the consulting firm BDO, said high-cost places like New York and Virginia needed to offer incentives to compete with cheaper areas. And he said the deals would pay off in the long run in jobs and tax revenues. ""Incentives are not subsidies,"" Mr. Stringer said. ""They are investments."" But it isn't clear they are good investments, said Jay Shambaugh, director of the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution. In offering incentives to Amazon, he said, New York and Virginia are effectively subsidizing a big, incumbent company at the expense of local businesses and start-ups. That is especially concerning, he added, when entrepreneurship rates are falling and cities are struggling to nurture homegrown businesses. That could be a particularly bitter pill for local retailers, many already struggling to compete with Amazon, said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, an advocacy group long critical of Amazon. ""If you're a local retailer or small manufacturer or artist or writer or publisher, you're watching as your city and state hands your tax dollars to your most ferocious antagonist,"" she said. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat who will represent parts of Queens in the House of Representatives starting in January, was one of several elected officials to criticize the deal. In a series of posts on Twitter, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said a company of Amazon's size shouldn't ""receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need MORE investment."" But even many critics of tax incentives said the packages offered to Amazon were less egregious than some past examples. The New York and Virginia tax credits are tied to the number of jobs the company actually creates. On a per-job basis, the packages offered to Amazon are smaller than some previous megadeals. For example, Wisconsin last year offered the Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn $3 billion in incentives for a project meant to employ 13,000 workers, at wages far lower than those promised by Amazon. The Foxconn deal, which has since grown even more expensive, has produced a public backlash in Wisconsin. There are signs that Amazon may have been concerned about a similar reaction. The company didn't choose the biggest incentive packages on offer, and in an unusual move, it included details of the tax breaks in its news release. And Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, noted that Amazon conducted the final stages of its search behind closed doors after a much more public search earlier in the process. ""They would have had another whole wave of blowback if they'd had another hunger games,"" Mr. LeRoy said."
19,2018-11-14," Two years ago, Matt Kelly couldn't have known that a failed merger involving his real estate firm would propel him toward a central role in Amazon's expansion plans. In May 2016, Mr. Kelly and his firm, then known as the JBG Companies, had an agreement to merge with a large real estate investment trust based in New York. But shareholders of the New York fund balked, and the deal collapsed. A few months later, JBG, based in Chevy Chase, Md., had a new partner. In a deal valued at $8.4 billion, JBG merged with a Washington unit spun off from the real estate behemoth Vornado Realty Trust. The new company, JBG Smith, with Mr. Kelly as chief executive, became the dominant landowner in a Northern Virginia region now being called National Landing, a dilapidated area that includes parts of Crystal City, Pentagon City and Potomac Yard. Amazon announced on Tuesday that it was choosing this area, along with New York City, for two new headquarters, with 50,000 employees between them. Since Amazon started its search for a so-called HQ2 over a year ago, the Washington region had been considered a front-runner. The region gives the company access to a large, tech-savvy work force and the transportation and infrastructure it wanted. Additionally, Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, has a home in the area. For Mr. Kelly, Amazon's decision validated a plan that he had been selling for the better part of a year: revitalizing Crystal City and its neighbors. Mr. Kelly's pitch was to turn a ghost town, as it has been described, into a thriving hot spot, including public green space and hip new retailers and entertainment venues. The plan relied on redeveloping 1970s-era office towers into sleek residential buildings. Skeptical investors have become believers, sending shares of JBG Smith up 7 percent in the past month. Analysts warn that Amazon most likely flexed its muscles to negotiate a deal with highly favorable terms, possibly pushing for below-market leases in an area that already trends well below national and Washington averages. For JBG Smith, the HQ2 deal may pay off in an uptick in occupancy and rents for residential, retail and other properties it owns adjacent to Amazon's new offices. But it could take five to seven years for this bonanza to arrive, said Danny Ismail, an analyst and lead of office coverage for the real estate research firm Green Street Advisors. ""This isn't going to be an overnight thing,"" Mr. Ismail said. Amazon said it intended to lease 500,000 square feet of office space in three buildings owned by JBG Smith. Amazon has also agreed to buy numerous plots of land held by JBG Smith that could be developed for an extra 4.1 million square feet. The purchase price of the land and other terms were not disclosed. JBG Smith officials did not respond to requests for comment. But in the announcement on Tuesday, the firm said it planned to accelerate construction on other projects in the area, including developments that would create more office and retail space as well as hundreds of residential units. Amazon's move is a chance for JBG Smith to turn lemons into lemonade. For the past year, JBG Smith's publicly traded real estate investment trust has trailed its peers, largely because of Crystal City and adjoining areas, which make up about a third of JBG Smith's portfolio. Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty first developed Crystal City in the 1960s and 1970s, and Vornado acquired that company in 2002. The Crystal City holdings eventually became an albatross for Vornado. Crystal City was once a thriving hub of government agencies and military contractors, but its fortunes sank after a 2005 mandate, in part for antiterrorism concerns, to relocate thousands of jobs from suburban office buildings to nearby military bases. In the following years, Crystal City lost 17,000 jobs, and 4.2 million square feet of office space became vacant. Since then, occupancy rates in the Crystal City region have hovered around 85 percent, among the lowest in the country, analysts say. But champions for the area argued that it still had plenty to offer a big employer, starting with its proximity to Ronald Reagan National Airport. ""It's the only place I've ever worked where you could walk to an airport. It's unique in its location and infrastructure,"" said Mitch Bonanno, a former senior vice president and director of development who oversaw the Washington team for Vornado/Charles E. Smith. JBG traces its roots to the late 1950s when three lawyers — Benjamin Jacobs, Donald Brown, and Joseph Gildenhorn — started a law and real estate firm in Rockville, Md. Through the 1970s and 1980s, the firm acquired and developed a number of high-profile properties in the Washington area, including the Four Seasons hotel in Georgetown and projects for the World Bank and the insurer Geico. In the 2000s, JBG began raising money from institutional investors for a series of funds that it used to invest in commercial real estate around Washington. JBG redeveloped part of Shaw, an inner-city neighborhood that was devastated by the 1968 riots after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. It called the area North End Shaw, a neighborhood geared toward millennials that featured stylish apartment buildings, trendy retailers like the eyewear company Warby Parker and a movie theater with a bar. In the spring of 2016, JBG was looking to expand. It announced a merger with New York REIT, a deal that would have made JBG a public entity, making it easier to raise money to buy properties. The deal also would have diversified JBG's portfolio into the New York City area. But New York REIT investors balked and by the end of the summer, the arrangement had been terminated. A few weeks later, JBG was being courted by Vornado. It wasn't their first flirtation. A few years earlier, Vornado's chief executive, Steven Roth, raised the idea of merging the firm's Washington property portfolio with JBG to form a separate, publicly traded business, according to a 2016 transcript from a Vornado earnings call. But JBG wasn't sold on the idea of going public and talks broke down. But the second time around, they struck a deal. The merger made JBG Smith a commanding player in the Washington market and, this week, a potential big winner in Amazon's plans. ""While hard to quantify,"" analysts at Stifel Financial wrote in a note to investors on Tuesday, ""this clearly drives up the value"" of JBG's future development pipeline."
0,2018-11-15," The deal to bring Amazon to Long Island City, at a cost of more than $2 billion in government incentives, has sparked outrage in many corners of New York City, particularly in Queens, where residents and elected officials have vowed resistance.  The anger is real: More than 100 people gathered Wednesday at a protest near the proposed site of Amazon's new offices, where the company has promised to employ more than 25,000 people in exchange for tax credits, direct state grants and city tax incentives.  ""Stay the Helipad Out,"" one sign read, a reference to Amazon getting the right to a helipad for its chief executive officer, Jeff Bezos. But the opponents' challenge is daunting: The deal reached between Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, Mayor Bill de Blasio and Amazon was explicitly constructed to minimize the ability of local politicians to block it. The company would not agree to come to New York City, Mr. de Blasio said, unless it could be assured it would not have to go through the lengthy process of approvals that would give the City Council veto power. The closed-door deal to avoid local review has angered many Council members and state legislators, some of whom appeared at Wednesday's rally. ""Why did they usurp the ability of the Council to do its job?"" asked a newly elected assemblywoman, Catalina Cruz, who represents the nearby Queens neighborhoods of Jackson Heights, Corona and Elmhurst. ""Because it's not good for our community."" But what can opponents actually do to stop it?  New York State has essentially taken over the process using what's known as a General Project Plan. The approach is not unique to Amazon's deal, and has been used in other major developments, including Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn. The City Council could try to alter or eliminate the tax breaks promised Amazon by the city, public policy experts said, but those are not unique to Amazon, and any changes would similarly affect other companies' tax packages. The State Legislature — soon to be dominated by Democrats — will also at some point have to extend the Excelsior tax credit program, which is providing $1.2 billion in tax incentives to Amazon and expires in 2026. The cap on those credits may also need to be raised. But nothing has to be done imminently, and the opposition in Albany is not uniform. Carl Heastie, the Assembly speaker, said in a statement that if the state's economic projections are correct, ""this deal has the potential to more than pay for itself."" The Bronx Democrat added, ""Of course we take our role in approving aspects of this deal very seriously and we will be closely reviewing it."" There will likely be a state-run environmental review to examine the impact of the Amazon development. But the input from local officials is only advisory. Opponents would not be able to block the deal — something they could have done if it went through the City Council.  One or more government boards must also review elements of the plan and the incentive package before it goes into effect. One of those, the Empire State Development board, is controlled by Mr. Cuomo's executive branch and is an unlikely avenue for opponents. Detractors may find that they have the most leverage at the obscure, five-member Public Authorities Control Board, which reviews and approves certain financing deals by state authorities. Some aspects of the Amazon deal, such as a $500 million state grant, are likely to go before that board, experts said.  ""The Public Authority Control Board will likely have to approve the agreement,"" said David J. Friedfel, director of state studies at the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission. The board is led by an appointee of the governor, but gives veto power to the Assembly speaker and the Senate leader, through their representatives, said E.J. McMahon, research director for the Empire Center for Public Policy, a research organization in Albany.  ""It's the main choke point,"" he said.  In 2005, the board rejected Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's plans for a stadium for the Far West Side of Manhattan as part of the city's failed bid for the 2012 Olympics.  But some critics believe that, too, could be an uphill battle.  The board's chairman, Robert F. Mujica Jr., said it would not necessarily review the state's incentive package. ""The capital grant does not have to go through P.A.C.B.,"" Mr. Mujica, who was appointed by Mr. Cuomo, said in an interview on Wednesday.  The prime option is to continue to publicly pressure Amazon. Hearings, even if they are nonbinding, could increase negative attention on the company, as could a court fight. Opponents of the Atlantic Yards development spent years in court and successfully trained negative attention on that plan. But they ultimately failed to stop the project, which includes the Barclays Center arena. ""The best strategy is to fight it by making Amazon feel uncomfortable coming to New York,"" said Dan Branda, director of policy at Reclaim New York, a government advocacy group that has received backing from some prominent conservatives.  ""All of these battles are uphill battles.""  Some opponents might be content to win a few concessions from the company, said James Parrott, director of economic and fiscal policy at the New School. ""There's certainly value in raising community concern and pushback from taxpayers, with the objective of trying to get enhanced commitments out of Amazon from this,"" he said. Others simply want Amazon to stay out of New York City. ""The leverage point, I think we saw it today: The outpouring of opposition to this proposal,"" said Stuart Appelbaum, whose union, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, took part in Wednesday's protest in Queens. He spoke by phone from a meeting in Geneva of international unions opposed to Amazon. ""Their business model depends on low taxes and low wages and a reduction of workers rights,"" he said. ""Is this the behavior that New York wants to reward?"" By the end of Wednesday, at least one possible presidential contender had begun criticizing the deal: Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. Nate Schweber contributed reporting."
1,2018-11-15," Instead of one new home, Amazon chose two. Two places, with waterfront views and organic shops and abandoned buildings, that will someday house tens of thousands of high-tech workers. We spent much of this week in those two places, Crystal City in Arlington, Va., and Long Island City in Queens, to capture life there as Amazon named them the winners of a 14-month-long beauty contest for its new headquarters. Together, the two areas — both are neighborhoods, not actually cities — could help make Amazon one of the largest private tech employers on the East Coast. Once Amazon fully moves in, neither will likely be the same.  Long Island City is home to the country's largest public housing project. But for many walking along the park in the area that hugs the East River, what stands out are the shiny new high-rises, baby stores, coffee shops and yoga studios.  Since 2010, more apartment buildings have been built in Long Island City than in any other neighborhood in New York. Apartments in dozens of the new buildings sell for an average of over $1 million. Many residents fear that Amazon's arrival will only intensify the gentrification making the neighborhood less affordable for people of limited means. Over the next decade, Amazon said, it plans to hire as many as 25,000 people, who will earn, on average, $150,000 a year. That same number of people, earning the same amount of money, are expected to fill Amazon's offices in Crystal City by 2030. Crystal City, just across the Potomac River from Washington, was the vision of a local developer, Robert Smith, who in the 1960s began to construct commercial buildings and high-rise condominiums on lots once occupied by industrial buildings and junkyards.  The neighborhood was named for a crystal chandelier that Mr. Smith hung in the first building.  Over the last dozen years, many of the neighborhood's prominent tenants left, sending Crystal City into a prolonged decline and leaving it without a strong residential or commercial identity. But a recent boom in the Washington region has helped fuel some redevelopment in and around Crystal City, which Amazon, like the local officials who pitched the area to the company, has started referring to as National Landing. In the end, Amazon said, it chose these two places, out of more than 200 that had thrown their hats in the ring, because of the talent it could recruit.  And with an army of well-paid workers will come amenities.  A short walk from Amazon's future headquarters in Crystal City is a new Whole Foods market, which is owned by Amazon, and a bar and restaurant that features a drag night. In Long Island City, bars line a main commercial strip that's home to a Michelin-starred Mexican restaurant and a trendy chicken and waffle restaurant owned by the rapper Nas. The hope over time, for the officials who made the pitch, is that Amazon will help cement their neighborhoods as destinations, with easy access to transportation, large supplies of housing and enough interesting things to do that they'll no longer be overshadowed by Washington and Manhattan just across the water."
2,2018-11-15,"  (Want to get New York Today by email? Here's the sign-up.)  It's Thursday.  Easy vote: The Mets pitcher Jacob DeGrom won the National League Cy Young Award in a landslide. It's the first snowfall of the year. Holiday music may be unavoidable. Your morning commute should be fine, but going home may be a little messy. Snow and sleet are expected to start by 2 p.m. and turn to freezing rain by 4 p.m. But the white stuff is not expected to stay long in the city. Expect an inch here, two to three inches in White Plains, and four to six inches further north and west, the National Weather Service says. (Sorry, Hamptons, you get nothing.) Temperatures will rise in late afternoon, said John Murray, a National Weather Service meteorologist. ""So the earlier it starts, the greater the chance there is of having some accumulation."" Either way, Mr. Murray said, by evening in the city, ""We're just looking at wet surfaces."" The afternoon high of 36 degrees will make the breeze of 8 to 13 miles per hour feel icy. A warning: Trains may be worse than usual today because people wearing bulky winter gear take up more space. So chug your pumpkin spice latte. Winter is here. New: A federal judge rejected a settlement deal between the New York City Housing Authority, the city and the United States attorney in Manhattan because, the judge said, the enforcement mechanisms were ""formless."" The judge said Congress and the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development were wrongly excluded from the agreement. The Times reports: Catch up: In June, federal investigators accused Nycha of misconduct and lying about conditions and maintenance at many of its 127,000 housing units. The authority signed a consent decree, admitting wrongdoing and accepting oversight from a federal monitor. Analysis: The timing couldn't be worse for Mayor Bill de Blasio. Hours before this decision, he was on MSNBC promoting the Amazon deal, which includes nearly $2 billion in city and state incentives for Amazon to open headquarters in Long Island City, Queens, near the largest housing authority project in the nation. Still a tale of two cities. That's the plan of Robert Bailey of Manhattan, 67, who played the numbers 8-12-13-19-27-4 to win $343.8 million in Powerball after 25 years of using the same numbers. (He split the jackpot with a woman from Iowa.) He accepted a check for $125,396,690 — his cut after taxes. It's not clear.

4,2018-11-15," The deal to bring Amazon to Long Island City, at a cost of more than $2 billion in government incentives, has sparked outrage in many corners of New York City, particularly in Queens, where residents and elected officials have vowed resistance.  The anger is real: More than 100 people gathered Wednesday at a protest near the proposed site of Amazon's new offices, where the company has promised to employ more than 25,000 people in exchange for tax credits, direct state grants and city tax incentives.  ""Stay the Helipad Out,"" one sign read, a reference to Amazon getting the right to a helipad for its chief executive officer, Jeff Bezos. But the opponents' challenge is daunting: The deal reached between Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, Mayor Bill de Blasio and Amazon was explicitly constructed to minimize the ability of local politicians to block it. The company would not agree to come to New York City, Mr. de Blasio said, unless it could be assured it would not have to go through the lengthy process of approvals that would give the City Council veto power. The closed-door deal to avoid local review has angered many Council members and state legislators, some of whom appeared at Wednesday's rally. ""Why did they usurp the ability of the Council to do its job?"" asked a newly elected assemblywoman, Catalina Cruz, who represents the nearby Queens neighborhoods of Jackson Heights, Corona and Elmhurst. ""Because it's not good for our community."" But what can opponents actually do to stop it?  New York State has essentially taken over the process using what's known as a General Project Plan. The approach is not unique to Amazon's deal, and has been used in other major developments, including Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn. The City Council could try to alter or eliminate the tax breaks promised Amazon by the city, public policy experts said, but those are not unique to Amazon, and any changes would similarly affect other companies' tax packages. The State Legislature — soon to be dominated by Democrats — will also at some point have to extend the Excelsior tax credit program, which is providing $1.2 billion in tax incentives to Amazon and expires in 2026. The cap on those credits may also need to be raised. But nothing has to be done imminently, and the opposition in Albany is not uniform. Carl Heastie, the Assembly speaker, said in a statement that if the state's economic projections are correct, ""this deal has the potential to more than pay for itself."" The Bronx Democrat added, ""Of course we take our role in approving aspects of this deal very seriously and we will be closely reviewing it."" There will likely be a state-run environmental review to examine the impact of the Amazon development. But the input from local officials is only advisory. Opponents would not be able to block the deal — something they could have done if it went through the City Council.  One or more government boards must also review elements of the plan and the incentive package before it goes into effect. One of those, the Empire State Development board, is controlled by Mr. Cuomo's executive branch and is an unlikely avenue for opponents. Detractors may find that they have the most leverage at the obscure, five-member Public Authorities Control Board, which reviews and approves certain financing deals by state authorities. Some aspects of the Amazon deal, such as a $500 million state grant, are likely to go before that board, experts said.  ""The Public Authority Control Board will likely have to approve the agreement,"" said David J. Friedfel, director of state studies at the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission. The board is led by an appointee of the governor, but gives veto power to the Assembly speaker and the Senate leader, through their representatives, said E.J. McMahon, research director for the Empire Center for Public Policy, a research organization in Albany.  ""It's the main choke point,"" he said.  In 2005, the board rejected Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's plans for a stadium for the Far West Side of Manhattan as part of the city's failed bid for the 2012 Olympics.  But some critics believe that, too, could be an uphill battle.  The board's chairman, Robert F. Mujica Jr., said it would not necessarily review the state's incentive package. ""The capital grant does not have to go through P.A.C.B.,"" Mr. Mujica, who was appointed by Mr. Cuomo, said in an interview on Wednesday.  The prime option is to continue to publicly pressure Amazon. Hearings, even if they are nonbinding, could increase negative attention on the company, as could a court fight. Opponents of the Atlantic Yards development spent years in court and successfully trained negative attention on that plan. But they ultimately failed to stop the project, which includes the Barclays Center arena. ""The best strategy is to fight it by making Amazon feel uncomfortable coming to New York,"" said Dan Branda, director of policy at Reclaim New York, a government advocacy group that has received backing from some prominent conservatives.  ""All of these battles are uphill battles.""  Some opponents might be content to win a few concessions from the company, said James Parrott, director of economic and fiscal policy at the New School. ""There's certainly value in raising community concern and pushback from taxpayers, with the objective of trying to get enhanced commitments out of Amazon from this,"" he said. Others simply want Amazon to stay out of New York City. ""The leverage point, I think we saw it today: The outpouring of opposition to this proposal,"" said Stuart Appelbaum, whose union, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, took part in Wednesday's protest in Queens. He spoke by phone from a meeting in Geneva of international unions opposed to Amazon. ""Their business model depends on low taxes and low wages and a reduction of workers rights,"" he said. ""Is this the behavior that New York wants to reward?"" By the end of Wednesday, at least one possible presidential contender had begun criticizing the deal: Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. Nate Schweber contributed reporting."
5,2018-11-15," Instead of one new home, Amazon chose two. Two places, with waterfront views and organic shops and abandoned buildings, that will someday house tens of thousands of high-tech workers. We spent much of this week in those two places, Crystal City in Arlington, Va., and Long Island City in Queens, to capture life there as Amazon named them the winners of a 14-month-long beauty contest for its new headquarters. Together, the two areas — both are neighborhoods, not actually cities — could help make Amazon one of the largest private tech employers on the East Coast. Once Amazon fully moves in, neither will likely be the same.  Long Island City is home to the country's largest public housing project. But for many walking along the park in the area that hugs the East River, what stands out are the shiny new high-rises, baby stores, coffee shops and yoga studios.  Since 2010, more apartment buildings have been built in Long Island City than in any other neighborhood in New York. Apartments in dozens of the new buildings sell for an average of over $1 million. Many residents fear that Amazon's arrival will only intensify the gentrification making the neighborhood less affordable for people of limited means. Over the next decade, Amazon said, it plans to hire as many as 25,000 people, who will earn, on average, $150,000 a year. That same number of people, earning the same amount of money, are expected to fill Amazon's offices in Crystal City by 2030. Crystal City, just across the Potomac River from Washington, was the vision of a local developer, Robert Smith, who in the 1960s began to construct commercial buildings and high-rise condominiums on lots once occupied by industrial buildings and junkyards.  The neighborhood was named for a crystal chandelier that Mr. Smith hung in the first building.  Over the last dozen years, many of the neighborhood's prominent tenants left, sending Crystal City into a prolonged decline and leaving it without a strong residential or commercial identity. But a recent boom in the Washington region has helped fuel some redevelopment in and around Crystal City, which Amazon, like the local officials who pitched the area to the company, has started referring to as National Landing. In the end, Amazon said, it chose these two places, out of more than 200 that had thrown their hats in the ring, because of the talent it could recruit.  And with an army of well-paid workers will come amenities.  A short walk from Amazon's future headquarters in Crystal City is a new Whole Foods market, which is owned by Amazon, and a bar and restaurant that features a drag night. In Long Island City, bars line a main commercial strip that's home to a Michelin-starred Mexican restaurant and a trendy chicken and waffle restaurant owned by the rapper Nas. The hope over time, for the officials who made the pitch, is that Amazon will help cement their neighborhoods as destinations, with easy access to transportation, large supplies of housing and enough interesting things to do that they'll no longer be overshadowed by Washington and Manhattan just across the water."
6,2018-11-15,"  (Want to get New York Today by email? Here's the sign-up.)  It's Thursday.  Easy vote: The Mets pitcher Jacob DeGrom won the National League Cy Young Award in a landslide. It's the first snowfall of the year. Holiday music may be unavoidable. Your morning commute should be fine, but going home may be a little messy. Snow and sleet are expected to start by 2 p.m. and turn to freezing rain by 4 p.m. But the white stuff is not expected to stay long in the city. Expect an inch here, two to three inches in White Plains, and four to six inches further north and west, the National Weather Service says. (Sorry, Hamptons, you get nothing.) Temperatures will rise in late afternoon, said John Murray, a National Weather Service meteorologist. ""So the earlier it starts, the greater the chance there is of having some accumulation."" Either way, Mr. Murray said, by evening in the city, ""We're just looking at wet surfaces."" The afternoon high of 36 degrees will make the breeze of 8 to 13 miles per hour feel icy. A warning: Trains may be worse than usual today because people wearing bulky winter gear take up more space. So chug your pumpkin spice latte. Winter is here. New: A federal judge rejected a settlement deal between the New York City Housing Authority, the city and the United States attorney in Manhattan because, the judge said, the enforcement mechanisms were ""formless."" The judge said Congress and the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development were wrongly excluded from the agreement. The Times reports: Catch up: In June, federal investigators accused Nycha of misconduct and lying about conditions and maintenance at many of its 127,000 housing units. The authority signed a consent decree, admitting wrongdoing and accepting oversight from a federal monitor. Analysis: The timing couldn't be worse for Mayor Bill de Blasio. Hours before this decision, he was on MSNBC promoting the Amazon deal, which includes nearly $2 billion in city and state incentives for Amazon to open headquarters in Long Island City, Queens, near the largest housing authority project in the nation. Still a tale of two cities. That's the plan of Robert Bailey of Manhattan, 67, who played the numbers 8-12-13-19-27-4 to win $343.8 million in Powerball after 25 years of using the same numbers. (He split the jackpot with a woman from Iowa.) He accepted a check for $125,396,690 — his cut after taxes. It's not clear.

8,2018-11-15," In 1618, an aspiring alchemist in Constantinople named Avedis created his first copper alloy cymbals. In 2018, a few hundred products from his brand, Zildjian, one of the oldest companies in the world, are eligible for Amazon Prime shipping, just like Hanes underwear or Xerox copiers or Bounty paper towels or Chanel perfume or an Eames chair or Colgate toothpaste or a brand-new PopSocket for your phone. There are vanishingly few types of consumer goods that you can't buy, in some form, on Amazon. But it is missing plenty of brands. In 2009, the company started selling products under its own name. It soon moved beyond the first AmazonBasics — items including budget electronics and batteries — to a wider range of Amazon-branded products. This was followed by an explosion of company-owned brands, including dozens with Amazon-free names.  Lark & Ro sells women's wear, Buttoned Down sells men's dress shirts; Pike Street sells linens; Strathwood sells furniture. These brands are intended to stand on their own, sort of. They are associated with Amazon, and listed on the site's dozens of different contexts as ""Our Brand"" or ""by Amazon"" or ""An Amazon Brand."" (Some new brands are undercover but then blow their cover, as in ""Amazon Brand - Solimo Pasta, Thin Spaghetti, 16oz."")  A lot of these brands — most explicitly the Basics products and various household staples — appear to be straightforward margin plays. Others, clothing brands in particular, fill gaps left by companies that have steered clear of the platform altogether. Others, well, who's to say? In the nearly 10 years since AmazonBasics arrived, the company has manifested an alternative brand reality, one both far more comprehensive and yet less conspicuous than those of its brick-and-mortar predecessors. (A family could mostly sustain itself on Kirkland products, but it would be abundantly aware it was living in Costco's world.) This effort is broadly understood to have been a success, generating up to $7.5 billion this year and potentially $25 billion by 2022, according to analysis by SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Amazon-affiliated brands are promoted in search results on the site and inflated by reviews from Amazon's Vine program, in which users receive items in exchange for their feedback. And, compared to better known competitors, they tend to be priced aggressively. In creating its own brands Amazon is indeed like any other large store. But Amazon isn't any other large store. It's Amazon: the world-historical logistical experiment that happens to call itself a store. It has unlimited shelf space and a boss with an eye on global domination. It tends to try a lot of things at once. And so while there are non-Amazon brands, and there are Amazon brands, there are also brands that live in the vast in-between. Some are exclusive to Amazon, but not exclusively owned by Amazon. Basic Care, which markets a variety of over-the-counter medications, is only available on Amazon; on the product page for ""Basic Care Night Time Cold & Flu, Cherry Flavor, 12 Fluid Ounce,"" Amazon's relationship to the product is not so obvious.  Especially if you compared it to a listing for one of Amazon's own brands, Lark & Ro. This arrangement, too, has decades of precedent in American retail: the trademark for Basic Care belongs to its manufacturer, Perrigo, which makes private-label products for Walmart, Kroger and others — brands that are exclusive to each store but that often do not bear the store's name. Some start as exclusive; some become exclusive.  The Equate brand, for example, which is comparable to Basic Care, was once owned by Perrigo, and sold in multiple chains, but it is now owned by Walmart. (It is, however, possible to buy Equate products on Amazon, but only through third-party vendors — Amazon's rough equivalent to eBay sellers. It is very difficult for any brand, even one that belongs to Amazon's primary competitor, to fully escape Amazon.) Anyone is free to create an in-between brand that is technically ""exclusive"" to Amazon, with or without Amazon's help. Large private-label manufacturers do it, as they have for other retailers for decades. Smaller companies have made Amazon their only sales channel and adopted new brand names for the site. These varied arrangements are minimally risky for Amazon, and increasingly appealing, or at least urgent, for companies watching as Amazon consolidates power. Earlier this year, the company announced an ""Accelerator"" program inviting companies to ""Join the Amazon Family of Brands,"" and more recently a link joined the footer of Amazon's website encouraging manufacturers to ""Sell Under Private Brands."" Starter, the venerable sportswear brand, lists products as ""exclusive to Amazon."" Carter's, which makes clothes for children, created a new label called Simple Joys just for the site. This can be useful to Amazon in a variety of ways. ""Sometimes the role of a brand is to be a price point,"" said Christopher Durham, the president of trade publication My Private Brand. ""Or it might be to help elevate something else — brands they want to be known for."" International companies also create made-for-Amazon brands in hopes of gaining more direct access to consumers in different markets, with a particular focus on the United States, though they sometimes suffer in translation. A search for ""three piece suit"" on Amazon returns a litany of budget brands like YFFUSHI, WULFUL and WEEN CHARM. Ungainly names aside, some of these labels have been positively reviewed, overcoming the considerable challenges of branding, and marketing, to an audience thousands of miles away, and sometimes relying on the Amazon seller marketplace and using the company to handle fulfillment — warehousing and shipping, basically. The ""WULFUL Men's Suit Slim Fit One Button 3-Piece Suit Blazer Dress Business Wedding Party Jacket Vest & Pants,"" for example, has been reviewed more than 170 times with an average rating of about four stars. ""This suit in made in China,"" the listing says, offering a guide for translating to U.S. sizes. The WULFUL name is trademarked to Hangzhou WuFei FuShi YouXian GongSi, out of Hangzhou, China. (""I thought that I was going a little bigger, based off the sizing chat,"" wrote a satisfied reviewer. ""However, when I received the product it fit a little snug. I did get lots of compliments on it, though!"") The internet, at any given time, has dozens of suggestions for how to ""make money from home"" or abandon your career for ""passive income."" Today, one of those suggestions is to create a private micro-label for Amazon. The financial tip site the Penny Hoarder published a guide to ""finding generic products that are already selling well on Amazon"" and ""marketing them better than your competition."" Once you've found a product — say, a particular style of water bottle — and a manufacturer, the guide suggests that you get a logo made before revealing your new brand to the world, or at least to Amazon shoppers. (The guide was published in 2015 and has more than 390,000 views.) What would distinguish these products from their equivalent WULFUL and YFFUSHI products, the thinking goes, is a more convincingly localized brand — a story, such as it is, tailored the market where it is meant to be sold. This is the tale of retail globalization, in miniature, told in the style of self-help. A distant manufacturer makes the product. You, the upstart importer — or massive domestic brand — rebrand it for your countrymen, and bring it to market.  As you scroll through the results for ""three piece suit,"" you'll eventually encounter a brand called Austin Mill. Austin Mill, like WULFUL, sells extremely affordable suits, as well as other men's apparel. But its name is at least vaguely consonant with a slice of American-style men's wear branding in 2018. The product descriptions are more carefully edited, and sizes are listed by measurement, not as foreign conversions. Crucially, Austin Mill has a logo. This logo was created on a site called 99designs, where users can post jobs for artists with fixed bounties. A ""logo contest"" listing for ""AUSTIN MILL: Mens Suiting"" offered $299 for a design, offering a few attached photos, and other logos, for guidance. Clients can use sliders to further specify their preferences.  The Austin Mill contest got 251 submissions; the one that won, by the user BAROKATANFIRRIZKI_88, now represents the brand.  Austin Mill's trademark is registered to Hangzhou YiShiHong E-Commerce Co., Ltd, also out of Hangzhou. But the 99designs contest was posted by a user named ""harpferg,"" who may be Harper Ferguson, listed on LinkedIn as ""Marketing Manager, PL Apparel at Amazon Fashion,"" but Amazon declined to comment, so, once again, who's to say? Since February, harpferg has posted 70 contests on 99designs, many of which produced logos for clothing brands exclusively available on Amazon, as identified by TJI Research, a retail analysis firm. These include Lumberfield, which sells outdoor gear, and Runyon Athletics, which sells exercise clothes.  A designer in Bulgaria named Ralitsa Hand created the winning logo for Brooke Mille, a casual women's apparel brand on Amazon. She said there was no hint that the company might have been involved. ""Usually the client writes some basic info in the brief in order to give directions for the designers,"" Ms. Hand said. ""I had no contact with the client."" (The sliders indicated the following: more ""Feminine"" than ""Masculine;"" more ""Organic"" than ""Geometric."") The user BIPARDO won the contest for another women's clothing brand called Beautiful Nomad, whose product pages are refined and furnished with professional photography. The listings do not, as of now, explicitly mention that the brand is exclusive to Amazon, or associated with Amazon at all. There are clues, however: The product page includes a box with ""More like this from Our Brands"" that lists other Beautiful Nomad products. The brand sometimes shows up in searches under an ""Our Brand"" header. Likewise, restricting results to ""Our Brands"" and then searching for specific product names can direct users to Beautiful Nomad. Clicking through to ""Women's Apparel"" in Amazon's ""Explore Our Brands"" page, however, yields 10 curated pages of products, featuring its house brands and some better-known exclusive brands, but not Brooke Mille, or others like it. An eagle-eyed discount suit shopper might notice, while browsing the WULFUL listing, an ""Our Brands"" box that promotes products by none other than Austin Mill. There are other signs of Amazon's guidance. Like its own brands, these no-man's brands have been seeded with reviews from Amazon's Vine program; in many cases, they have no other reviews. One Brooke Mille reviewer, who was granted anonymity so as not to lose access to the program, which is tightly policed by Amazon, described Brooke Mille as ""one of those under the radar Amazon Brands."" ""Some are without a doubt Amazon brands,"" he said, ""while others require a little research to discover that fact. Sometimes that fact is emphasized and other times it is downplayed."" Unfamiliar with a new brand of socks he'd been sent, a different Vine reviewer named Sanpete did some searching, found the logo contests, made the Amazon connection and shrugged. ""Kosy Komfort appears to be a new brand,"" he wrote in his review. ""Good deal on that logo.""  He added: ""They're very nice socks, comfortable indeed."" Brooke Mille did not respond to a message sent through Amazon. Amazon declined to comment, but emphasized, as it does in some places on its site, that ""Our Brands"" include both Amazon-owned and ""exclusive"" brands. If there's a mystery here, it's just which of the many plausible and reasonable explanations are at work.  ""I think Amazon, number one, sees the value of having more SKUs,"" said Mr. Durham, referring to distinct product listings. It would make sense for Amazon to offer a helping hand with branding, he suggested, particularly to companies struggling to break through from overseas. A glut of new brands could produce helpful data: In which categories is Amazon branding a liability? Or a help? (Do noodles taste better when you think of them as internet spaghetti? Would you rather not think of Jeff Bezos when you're applying baby oil?) There are other possibilities, too. In October, eBay sent a cease-and-desist letter to Amazon accusing it of using its internal messaging system to poach sellers from the auction platform; offering guidance with marketing might sweeten such an approach. And among the services advertised in the new ""Accelerator"" program: ""Brands will receive a suite of marketing support executed by our Amazon merchandising team."" (CNBC first reported the existence of the accelerator program in October. The last logo contest was posted two months ago.) Consumers are used to seeing private label brands — or packer's labels, or store brands, or house brands, or reanimated ghost brands — in stores even if we don't quite understand what they are or where they come from. Some brands are labeled ""for Target,"" while others just don't seem to exist anywhere else, and so we make our assumptions, or don't think of them at all, and keep shopping. As is often the case with Amazon, what seem like strange or inexplicable new behaviors are often old retail strategies unfolding on the internet, quickly, and in plainer view. Brooke Mille is no more a lie than any other brand: It's just newer and faster and more online. And it has a lot more company. "
9,2018-11-15," So, the Amazon bragging rights go to New York City and the Washington, D.C., area. Why do I feel a little deflated? Amazon's choices for its secondary headquarters should be mostly good news for a New York City resident and frequent Washington visitor like me. New York's airports, bridges, highways and tunnels may finally get the capital investment they desperately need. Maybe we'll even get high-speed rail to Washington. Long Island City, the Queens neighborhood that Amazon picked, will become a high-tech Brooklyn, with a bevy of new farm-to-table restaurants, craft cocktail watering holes and, naturally, the artisanal coffee roasters already ubiquitous in Seattle, all just a subway stop from Manhattan. True, there may be more congestion, higher condo prices and other unwanted side effects, but a metropolitan area the size of New York shouldn't have any trouble absorbing an additional 25,000 people. And I guess that's the source of my disappointment: For all the transformative potential of Amazon's nationwide ""HQ2"" competition, neither New York City nor Washington (nor, to be precise, the Northern Virginia neighborhoods that are being rechristened National Landing) needed Amazon. They're already thriving and bustling with affluent, well-educated millennials. [What the winners look like: Our photographers spent the week exploring Crystal City and Long Island City. Here's what they saw.] As Tom Stringer, head of site selection for the business consulting firm BDO, told me this week, Amazon's choice ""only reaffirms and cements the idea that we have two countries right now, the coasts and the interior."" Even a large, sophisticated Midwestern city like Chicago would at least have been a nod toward America's heartland. With fond memories of growing up in a small city in the Midwest, where the population (and housing prices) have barely budged in recent decades, I admit to having a soft spot for some of the underdogs on Amazon's list of finalists: Indianapolis; Columbus, Ohio; and Nashville. (The latter won a consolation prize from Amazon, which said it would build an ""Operations Center of Excellence"" there.) Picking one of those cities — or one that didn't advance to Amazon's final round, like Detroit, St. Louis or Cleveland — would have been transformative. And not just for those cities, but as an affirmation that there are great places to live in America that don't offer ocean views and $3,000-a-square-foot condos. ""There are smaller cities in this country that are incredible places to live,"" Mr. Stringer said. ""They're great places to raise families, they're affordable, and they're fun."" In its initial request for proposals, Amazon emphasized many of those qualities, ranking costs second on its list of priorities. That led pundits to eliminate New York, San Francisco, Boston and Washington, all of them among the most expensive places to live or do business, according to KPMG's annual Competitive Alternatives survey. Among Amazon's finalists, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Chicago had some of the lowest costs. Of course, the potentially multibillion-dollar tax incentives that New York and Northern Virginia are lavishing on Amazon help compensate for the locations' high costs. But presumably other cities dangled big tax breaks, too. ""Labor force"" ranked third on Amazon's list of criteria, but in the end, it seemed to be determinative. It was the first thing that Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, mentioned when he announced the winners: ""These two locations will allow us to attract world-class talent that will help us to continue inventing for customers for years to come."" That, in part, reflects the same self-reinforcing tendencies that are driving creative, well-educated workers to the two coasts, with just a handful of high-tech, hipster enclaves (like Austin, Tex., and Denver, two Amazon finalists) in between. ""There's a herding instinct,"" Mr. Stringer said. ""People in creative fields — medical research and technology, law, financial services — they all want to be in the same mix. That's what makes them good. And for companies, their value-added quotient is rare, and it's what everybody wants."" It's not Amazon's obligation to help heal the growing divide between red and blue America. In holding the competition, it generated tremendous publicity, mostly favorable, and attracted enormous financial incentives, all of which will benefit Amazon's shareholders. At the same time, the company, and Mr. Bezos in particular, might have considered that Amazon's success has hollowed out aging downtowns and shopping malls across America, and that having at least one headquarters away from the coasts might have generated considerable political good will. So where does that leave the heartland? All isn't lost. After reaching a nadir in the past decade, Detroit is staging a comeback, building on its automotive roots and attracting a new wave of hotels, restaurants and entertainment options. Communities away from the coasts shouldn't be trying to lure the Amazons and Googles — already huge and well-established companies, Mr. Stringer said. They need to emphasize their strengths and incubate the Amazons of the future. And who knows: The truly creative may want to break from the herd and do something original — like moving to St. Louis."
0,2018-11-16," [What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox] For parts of his tenure, Mayor Bill de Blasio has been criticized for straying from his progressive roots, with some of his loyal supporters accusing him of failing to deliver on promises to help the homeless, or advance criminal justice reforms. Those grumblings turned into a full-throated roar this week, with the mayor's enthusiastic backing of a billion-dollar incentive deal to bring Amazon to Long Island City, Queens. How could the liberal mayor of New York City who vowed to end the ""tale of two cities"" — one rich, the other poor — support this sort of development? The short answer, said some real estate developers and former political aides, is that he almost always has. When Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg pushed forward a contentious plan to build taller buildings along a thoroughfare in brownstone Brooklyn, he found support from Mr. de Blasio, then the local councilman. Mr. de Blasio also backed Mr. Bloomberg's development over Atlantic Yards, a project that spawned years of loud battles, court fights and drew active neighborhood opposition. ""He really seemed unmovable in his support for it,"" said Eric McClure, a Park Slope neighborhood activist who met with Mr. de Blasio in 2005 and presented thousands of signatures opposing the project. He failed to change Mr. de Blasio's mind. The mayor's stance on Amazon is even more firm. ""I get the angst, I get the questions,"" Mr. de Blasio said in an interview on Thursday, but blocking it would be a ""huge mistake."" ""I think this deal should be respected because of all it would bring,"" the mayor said, pointing to the ""staggering"" number of jobs involved — some 25,000 or more when Amazon is fully moved in to Long Island City. The cost in city and state tax incentives and a state grant would total roughly $3 billion, a figure cited Thursday by Howard Zemsky, the head of the state's economic development arm. Yet Mr. de Blasio's positions on real estate development, including his efforts to rezone large areas of New York City, have often put him in direct conflict with his political base, and stretched the distance between his rhetoric and the reality of governing. Advocates for the poor, who helped secure his re-election last year, still chafe at his housing plan, which critics say does not provide enough housing for the poorest New Yorkers. Several City Council members are pushing a bill that would require any rental housing project that receives taxpayer subsidies — such as tax abatements, loans, tax credits or reduced-cost land — to set aside 15 percent of its created or preserved units for people living in the city's shelter system. Mr. de Blasio's current housing policy calls for a 5 percent set-aside, and he has said he is strongly against increasing that number. But the deal for Amazon, for some, was the last straw. ""I expected this mayor to be a stalwart of deeply income-targeted affordable housing,"" said Jumaane Williams, a Brooklyn councilman who is running to become the city's public advocate. ""Every day it's something else. This Amazon deal took the cake for me."" He added: ""You give away $3 billion? $3 billion? To the richest man in America? For a company that will most likely come here anyway?"" Stuart Appelbaum, the president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, fumed at Amazon and expressed friction with Mr. de Blasio. ""The mayor is a great ally, but on this issue, we differ on whether or not Amazon belongs in New York,"" he said. Examples of Mr. de Blasio's pro-development and pro-growth stance are numerous. As mayor, he supports a sprawling redevelopment project to be built over the Sunnyside rail yards in Queens, next to Long Island City; a public hearing was held last month. He has advocated zoning changes in some areas of the city, such as East New York, Brooklyn, that could lead to large increases in density and the construction of both affordable and market-rate housing. He has also relied on the campaign contributions of developers. Indeed, Mr. de Blasio's deputy mayor for housing and economic development, Alicia Glen, is eager to increase the amount of building in New York City, believing along with the mayor that the key to providing more housing for low-income residents is to provide more housing for everyone — and then require some of it to be affordable. In her office, she has a photograph of a Shanghai skyline densely and haphazardly packed with apartment towers mixed with older structures — a caution about unplanned growth but also a vision of possibility. It is an outlook that Mr. de Blasio has long embraced. ""We believe there is a type of development in communities that can be good, but it has to come with the public sector driving a hard bargain on behalf of the people,"" Mr. de Blasio said on Thursday. At the same time, the mayor has also taken swipes at ""greedy landlords"" and has sought the support of community groups that oppose gentrification. That has landed him in trouble when he has tried to pass zoning changes because opponents perceive that his rhetoric does not match his actions. As one former city official observed: The people who have protested outside the home of Ms. Glen are also his base. It also makes it easier for critics to paint him as hypocritical, with the Amazon deal in particular, because he has also railed against the retail giant, while defending small, locally owned stores. ""We were very surprised to see him sitting at that table at that press conference,"" said Deborah Axt of Make the Road New York, an immigrant advocacy organization that has backed Mr. de Blasio. ""The subsidy package is disgusting. As details come out, we're more and more depressed about it and outraged."" She added that the deal ""is absolutely not all on the mayor,"" pointing out that he sat alongside Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. But she said she was ""substantially less surprised"" by the governor. ""Our sense is that the governor has long supported this kind of corporate giveaway,"" she said. Mr. de Blasio defended the city incentives, which could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, as available to any company and not tailor-made for Amazon. The company's presence in the city was not in contrast with his efforts to reduce income inequality, he said, but would ultimately subsidize those plans and programs. ""There's a whole left position that says you need development to help people achieve their potential,"" he said, a tradition that stretches back to the time of Karl Marx. ""A major international corporation has their own agenda,"" Mr. de Blasio said. ""Meanwhile the strongest city government in America is basically a European social democracy that somehow broke loose from the continent and came here."" ""Using the power of government,"" he added, ""we dictate the terms in as many ways as we can. And in this case, we did that."""

2,2018-11-16," Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the week's news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here. Hello from Seattle. I'm Karen Weise, the new tech correspondent here. As you might imagine, the announcement of Amazon's decision in what it had billed as a search for a second headquarters, a.k.a. HQ2, has dominated news here this week. After 14 months of near silence from the company — and a week of reporting that it was closing in on a choice — Amazon finally said it would split HQ2 in two, between the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens and the Crystal City area of Arlington, Va., just across the Potomac River from Washington. I've found the HQ2 search and the obsession around it fascinating because of the blatant display of Amazon's power to promise jobs and lobby politicians, thanks to the company's market dominance and consumer adoration. The choice to enter New York is particularly interesting because Amazon will need to deal with a local political environment that is far more complex than its hometown's. Seattle has plenty of activism — from the 1999 World Trade Organization protests to becoming the first big city to pass a $15 minimum wage — and certainly there's some antagonism toward Amazon. But the labor, media and electoral politics of New York are a different breed. That's been evident in the blowback to the more than $2 billion in planned tax subsidies there. That the state promised to help Amazon get access to a helipad didn't help. The New York Post cover blared ""Queens Ransom"" next to a picture of the company founder, Jeff Bezos, laughing in a helicopter holding bags of cash. A hundred people protested at the Long Island City site, waving signs like one that read ""Stay the Helipad Out."" Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democratic senator from New York, joined the chorus of skeptics. ""One of the wealthiest companies in history should not be receiving financial assistance from taxpayers,"" she wrote on Twitter. And Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the incoming Democratic representative for parts of Queens, as well as the Bronx, said she had heard ""outrage"" from her constituents. Until recently, Amazon barely involved itself in Seattle's civic politics. Its growth was steady for more than a decade, only kicking into high gear the past few years. For a while, Amazon's main involvement with city hall was more about small things like approvals for street vacations than major politics. That began to change in 2015, when Amazon's real estate head, John Schoettler, who was deeply involved in the HQ2 search, led the local Chamber of Commerce. Earlier this year, Amazon publicly fought a new tax to pay for homeless services and affordable housing. But there was never a singular moment like this when Seattle got to ask: Do we want Amazon here? If so, do we want taxpayers to pay for it? When news of a split HQ2 broke, Mayor Jenny Durkan of Seattle said, ""I'd call those branch offices."" It's a good zinger, but while Seattle may want to call it a win, several experts pointed out to me that Amazon will now have three cities to pit against one another for decades to come. Talk about leverage. And Amazon is still calling the two new locations headquarters. ""We know there will be leaders and teams in all three headquarters as we map out the growth,"" Jay Carney, a senior vice president at Amazon, told me. ""We are already a company that spans the country, with employees in over 45 states. I'm on the leadership team but live in D.C. and am in Seattle today. It reinforces what already exists for us."" How that division shakes out will be interesting to track. The New York office is already home to much of Amazon's growing advertising group, which has become almost an obsession among investors because of its high margins. That's a mix of the technical and creative work that's already thriving in the city. Many had suggested that a Washington-area choice could signal a growing dependence on government contracts, like a $10 billion cloud deal for the Defense Department that Amazon is favored to win. But Amazon's agreement with Virginia specifically states that the incentives Amazon gets will decrease if more than 10 percent of the work done at that location is for federal contracts, something that reflects the state's goal of diversifying its economy away from government work. So what's Amazon's vision there? Some other tech stories of note this week: ■ I don't want to let HQ2 suck even more oxygen out of the room than it already has, so please take the time to read the investigation five incredible colleagues published on Wednesday. The report looks into how Facebook's top leadership failed to fully reckon with the company's complicity in political and social manipulation. It provides a rarely critical and comprehensive look into the top ranks of the company. ■ Uber lost more than $1 billion last quarter, and its growth is slowing, Kate Conger reports. This news comes as the ride-hailing company marches toward a 2019 public offering. ■ How weird is social media marketing? Sapna Maheshwari has one word for you: nanoinfluencers. ■ And finally, just in case you think it's all bad news about tech this week, Farhad Manjoo has this charming love letter to Google Photos. As he said, ""Who expects software to make them cry?"" Karen Weise writes about the technology industry in Seattle. You can follow her at: @KYWweise. Our weekly technology newsletter will take a break next week for the Thanksgiving holiday weekend."
3,2018-11-16," For decades, experts have called for the diversification of the New York City economy. In the wake of postwar deindustrialization, our reliance on Wall Street and the financial industry in general had by the 1990s left our city disproportionately vulnerable to swings in the financial markets. We have experienced significant downturns that today feel like distant memories but could certainly return. I know this from my own experience as director of planning for Manhattan after Sept. 11.  In those heady dark days, few spoke about gentrification or the supposedly ominous specter of new companies entering New York City. To the contrary, many worried that no one would build so much as a Quonset hut in this city again. Darker still were the memories of my older colleagues in city government, who helped rescue us from the nose-dive of the late 1970s, when New York City lost hundreds of thousands of jobs and crime ravaged our most vulnerable neighborhoods. It is with dismay that I hear the fiercely negative reaction to the announcement that New York City won the Amazon competition to land at least 25,000 jobs and decades of direct and indirect economic growth in Long Island City. The fact that the debate has yielded so much heat and so little light is a sign of how complacent we have become. It is easy to forget that employment generates our city tax base, which strains to help fund the public goods we so desperately need, from schools to transit to affordable housing to parks to basic services like snow and trash removal. The city's tax revenues have more than doubled since Sept. 11, to $83 billion from $40 billion. The Bloomberg administration put us in this enviable economic position; Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo should be lauded for doubling down on those efforts. Yet there are stiff headwinds. Municipal spending is outpacing growth. Federal urban investments continue to retract. And we already have some of the highest income taxes in the country. Julissa Ferreras-Copeland, who served on the City Council until 2017 and was chairwoman of the council's finance committee, said of the budget: ""We know there's a storm coming. We don't know how big it's going to be.""  It is for these reasons that we should welcome Amazon, but with a few caveats: To become true New Yorkers, the people at Amazon must abide by our implicit social compact, which is that New York City strives to be a place of opportunity for all. Amazon, the city and the state must build an ""infrastructure of opportunity"" that creates both physical and social mobility for all New Yorkers, and they must do so with fiscal responsibility.  While opinions differ regarding the incentive package offered Amazon, a few things are clear: Amazon obtained incentives available to any forward-looking large company seeking to relocate here. Second, government officials involved are confident that the deal will yield between $12 billion and $27 billion of direct economic benefit, which is many multiples of the incentives offered; and third, the incentives are part of the city and state's established budget to lure companies here — not money that would otherwise go to subways and schools.  Beyond these incentives, government investments should be focused on significant improvements to the physical mobility of western Queens, including a reimagined subway, streetcar, bus, bike, scooter and ferry network. The agreement does establish an Infrastructure Fund using targeted tax revenue, but the details, time frame and scope for the improvements are murky and should be clarified. Amazon must participate as well — let's press those logistics experts less about a helipad and more about how they hope to transport thousands of workers to one of the most congested parts of our city. First steps have been made, along with commitments to make Amazon's new waterfront home accessible to the public in accordance with the Long Island City waterfront design guidelines.  More significant is the potential to create a new paradigm for social mobility. We lost this along with our manufacturing base and never regained it by relying on Wall Street. Unsung treasures like LaGuardia Community College, Queensbridge Houses and the public schools and cultural institutions of Queens shouldn't be thrown the crumbs of this project. Amazon is proposing to locate in the most ethnically diverse county in the United States and near the nation's largest public housing project — the company's work force and campus must reflect the diversity around them.  The current agreement with Amazon, which calls for $15 million to fund work force development and three years of direct engagement with Queensbridge Houses, is a good first step. More should be done, including a longer-term goal of 50 percent of all employees drawn from the borough. This is an enormous opportunity for Amazon to differentiate itself from its competitors by proving that it can help bridge what has become a gaping American class divide.  Amazon will continue to be criticized about the way it held this competition, even though New Yorkers have long advocated more business growth outside of Manhattan. (Queens has a population similar to Chicago's but nowhere near the economic output.) Amazon will be criticized for its impacts on small retailers, although it arguably hurts big-box stores far more than mom-and-pops, which sell through Amazon. It will be criticized for being one of the world's richest companies, by both the left and the right.  But in the end, the benefits to everyday New Yorkers should be substantial enough to put all of these criticisms to rest. At best, it will spur a return on investment that in 20 years doubles the city's tax revenues, as happened in the past two decades. Such an outcome would fund the physical and social infrastructure needs for a city that by then could be 10 million strong.  This isn't about one company. It is about fulfilling our collective dream of New York as a city of opportunity for millions of strivers of all colors, genders and creeds. Our new socioeconomic ladder appears to be digital, and we should embrace it, if — and only if — its creators have the tenacity and temerity to embrace us."
0,2018-11-17," An Alexander McQueen documentary debuts on Amazon. And a Sundance TV series looks back at the Jonestown massacre. McQUEEN (2018) on Amazon. The story of the renegade fashion designer Alexander McQueen, who died in 2010, has been told in a play, in biographies and in countless tabloids. This moving documentary by Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui is a welcome addition to that chronicle. It honors the designer's eccentric vision through catwalk footage from his daring runway shows and interviews with family and friends. ""Feeling less like a celebration than a fond farewell, 'McQueen' successfully steers clear of hagiography,"" Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in her review for The New York Times. ""Michael Nyman's score can be annoyingly pushy. Yet the filmmakers' emphasis on drama honors the driven personality of their subject, while tracing a fairly conventional glad-rags-to-riches narrative arc."" JONESTOWN: TERROR IN THE JUNGLE 9 p.m. on Sundance TV. This new two-part documentary series comes out 40 years after the Jonestown massacre and explores how the cult leader Jim Jones organized a mass suicide that killed more than 900 people in Guyana. Based on the book ""The Road to Jonestown: Jim Jones and Peoples Temple"" by the journalist Jeff Guinn, the show weaves archival footage and unreleased recordings of interviews with survivors and Jones's relatives to paint a picture of the events. One of the factors that led to the followers' acceptance, Carey Winfrey wrote in The Times in 1979, was Jones's call for ""revolutionary suicide"": the belief that ""we're going to show how a force of so many people can do so much to shape the world."" BAREFOOT CONTESSA: COOK LIKE A PRO 8 p.m. on Food Network. Thanksgiving would be nothing without a juicy, family-size turkey. But in this one-hour special, the host Ina Garten suggests it's what surrounds the centerpiece that makes the meal. She shares new recipes for mouthwatering sides like leek bread pudding, sautéed brussels sprouts and three variations of mashed potatoes, while guests Jennifer Garner, Nigella Lawson and Marcus Samuelsson weigh in with their own favorites. A MURDER IN MANSFIELD (2017) 9 p.m. on Investigation Discovery. In this searing documentary by Barbara Kopple, Collier Landry returns to Mansfield, Ohio, where his mother was killed by his father in 1989. Landry was 12 when he testified against his father; here he confronts him and recounts how he coped with his mother's death nearly 30 years ago. SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE 11:30 p.m. on NBC. Steve Carell returns as host in an appearance expected to be his quote-unquote return to comedy. He's joined by the British singer-songwriter Ella Mai. Far from his silly roles in ""The Office"" or ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" Carell is currently starring opposite Timothée Chalamet in the father-son tear-jerker ""Beautiful Boy."" In movies next month, Carell plays an artist overcoming trauma in the fantasy-drama ""Welcome to Marwen,"" and will portray Donald Rumsfeld in the political feature ""Vice."""
0,2018-11-18," Hello! Welcome to the second edition of With Interest. Once again, we're sending you the most important business and tech news, highlighting the essentials from the past week and what's in store for the next. Our goal is to keep this succinct and informative. So have a read, share with a friend and settle in, hopefully, for a nice, short holiday week. Will you be one of the 54.3 million Americans leaving home for your turkey dinner this year? If so, pack snacks and bring a good book (or three): This week is expected to have the highest volume of Thanksgiving travel since 2005. Apparently, rising household incomes have everyone in a festive mood and are making us willing to overlook traffic jams and crowded airports. (Just do us all a favor and don't be that person who tries to sneak leftover gravy through security, O.K.?) Facebook scrambled to mount a defense after The New York Times published an article on Wednesday describing how company executives ignored, then denied or obfuscated, signs that its power could be exploited — specifically, to disrupt elections, broadcast viral propaganda and inspire deadly campaigns of hate. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, and his No. 2, Sheryl Sandberg, pleaded ignorance to the actions of a Washington-based consulting firm, Definers Public Affairs, which had orchestrated smear campaigns against Facebook's critics, including the billionaire philanthropist George Soros. (The company fired the firm.) Mr. Zuckerberg reiterated that he would not step down. In Washington, lawmakers called for Congressional hearings and more regulatory scrutiny. Advertisers — Facebook's real constituents — are displeased. And Facebook stock closed on Friday at a low for the year. With much fanfare and little surprise, Amazon announced on Tuesday that its second headquarters (or ""HQ2"") will be split between Arlington, Va., and Long Island City in Queens. The retail giant, however, isn't getting the warmest of New York welcomes. Yes, Amazon expects to create an estimated 25,000 jobs, and both Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo hailed it as a win. But they also promised Amazon, which generates $178 billion in annual revenue, significant state tax breaks and $1.525 billion in incentives — plus allowing a helipad for Jeff Bezos. That hasn't sat well with some residents and local officials, who question if New York needed to sweeten the pot so much. The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday proposed a ban on menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars, its most aggressive move against the tobacco industry in over a decade. Intended to curb teen use of tobacco (flavored products are more popular with young people), the action would prohibit the sale of about a third of the roughly 250 billion cigarettes purchased annually in the United States. Meanwhile, Juul Labs — whose products account for about 70 percent of the country's e-cigarette market — suspended sales of most of its flavored products and discontinued its social media promotions. In Britain, the challenges will continue for Prime Minister Theresa May as she attempts to woo support for her much-derided Brexit proposal. She has finally secured cabinet approval for her long-awaited plan — but critics argue that there are too many concessions to the European Union, which may prevent a necessary ""aye"" from Parliament. Two of her cabinet members, including her chief Brexit negotiator, quit in protest last week, and if others jump ship, Ms. May could be dumped by her own party. So much for a Brexit process that she claimed would be ""smooth and orderly"" (to which the House of Commons laughed uproariously). Expect fewer stampeding hordes on Black Friday this year, as more customers choose to shop on the web instead of lining up in mall parking lots at dawn. Last year, Cyber Monday was the largest day of online shopping in American history; this year, analysts predict, will break that record by 17.6 percent, reaching $7.7 billion in total sales. Post-Thanksgiving discount bonanzas are hardly confined to just one day (or even post-Thanksgiving) anymore. To get a competitive edge, Walmart and other retailers will kick off their online offers even earlier — 10 p.m. Eastern on Thanksgiving Eve, before turkey-induced lethargy sets in. Move over, football: The nation's largest e-sports facility opens in Arlington, Tex., on Saturday. That will be a venue for people to watch other people play video games. Buoyed by slick marketing, glitzy production, multimillion-dollar prizes and the outsize personalities of many celebrity gamers, the e-sports audience is predicted to reach 380 million worldwide by the end of 2018, with a yearly revenue of $900 million. Arlington invested $10 million in the new stadium, which accommodates 2,000 people and features tricked-out reclining chairs and giant overhead screens. Forget Tesla's woes — Elon Musk's SpaceX held its 18th successful launch this year, shooting a Falcon 9 rocket into orbit from Florida on Thursday. Back on earth, Beyoncé severed ties with Topshop, the co-owner of her Ivy Park clothing label, after the retailer's chairman was accused of sexual harassment. And: Do you hate your open-plan office? Here's a handy guide to making it work. It also offers guidance on private spots to cry, when it's that kind of day. 10: The dollar value of the newest Canadian bank note, which enters circulation on Monday. The bill features Viola Desmond, a civil rights activist who was jailed for sitting in a whites-only section of a Nova Scotia movie theater in 1946."
0,2018-11-19," What is it that makes Amazon different from other large companies? Certainly, the sheer range of the products it sells and its market power are unmatched in corporate America. The recent frenzy over its HQ2 pick is another expression of its outsize influence on the economy. But there is another difference that is much less appreciated yet has been more significant in shaping its path: Amazon's resource-allocation strategy — in particular, how it chooses to use the profits that it earns. It is one of very few large American corporations that is choosing to retain its profits and reinvest them rather than cutting payrolls and distributing corporate cash to shareholders as dividends and buybacks. Most Americans know Amazon through the consumer end of its business, with tens of thousands of low-wage workers handling orders at distribution sites around the country. It would be a mistake, however, to see Amazon's growth as driven primarily by low-wage employment. While most of Amazon's revenues come from the sale of low-priced products, most of its profits come from its cloud computing operation, Amazon Web Services.  This high-tech division, which has made Amazon the world leader in cloud computing, accounted for less than 10 percent of Amazon's revenues in 2017 but generated $4.3 billion in operating income. By comparison, North American web sales, which accounted for 60 percent of revenue, generated only $2.8 billion in profit. The web services division has transformed Amazon into an enormously profitable company. Amazon incurred an annual loss of $241 million as recently as 2014, but in the first nine months of 2018, it had net income of $7 billion — more than double its $3 billion in profits for all of 2017. But unlike so many big, successful American public companies, Amazon does not use those profits to make distributions to shareholders. (Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive, is the largest.) The company has not paid a dividend since going public in 1997, nor has it done any buybacks of its shares since 2012.  That makes it an outlier among big American companies. From 2013 to 2017, companies that were in the S.&.P. 500 index during that period gave away 98 percent of their profits to shareholders, with 56 percent as buybacks. Instead of squandering its profits on buybacks, Amazon has been reinvesting them in its business and its employees. That strategy is reflected in spending on research and development, where Amazon is far and away the world leader. The investment shows up in its work force. From 2014 to 2016, Amazon increased its United States employment of high-paid ""professionals,"" mainly software engineers, to 30,433 from 18,266. And it will be adding many more of those among the 50,000 people it will eventually employ at its new outposts in New York City and in Northern Virginia. With all those retained profits, Amazon can easily afford to increase the wages of its low-paid workers, too. Starting this month, the company is paying its more than 350,000 employees in the United States a minimum of $15 per hour, although there was criticism that some hourly employees would actually make less under the new payment scheme. That shouldn't obscure the fact that it is while paying low wages to a rising majority of its workers that Amazon has become a behemoth — growing from 17,000 worldwide employees in 2007 to 566,000 in 2017. With median pay of its United States full-time employees at $34,123 in 2017, almost half of those workers are in the low-paid ranks, meaning a job that pays less than two-thirds of the median wage for men. And the $31,200-per-year yielded by Amazon's new minimum wage will remain low-paid work by American standards. Senator Bernie Sanders praised Amazon after the $15-an-hour announcement, saying he hoped that other companies would follow its lead. But Amazon sets a much more important example in the way it chooses to use its profits to reinvest in its business and its employees rather than on buybacks. It is because Amazon has engaged in this ""retain and reinvest"" growth strategy that the company now has the profits to share its prosperity with its employees and to add 50,000 employees in any city. The company should continue this strategy, making it a top priority to bring the pay of its low-paid employees closer to a middle-class standard of living.  And, following Amazon's example, other American companies should drive their growth by retaining profits to invest in innovation. They should then use the gains to raise the pay of all their employees, instead of spending billions on buybacks that make the rich even richer.  Of course, there are many valid criticisms of Amazon, including how it treats small firms that sell products on its website, the demanding pace of work for its employees, and the fact that it has not yet gone very far in raising wages for low-paid employees.  But by being different, and choosing to reinvest profits in the current ""financialized"" business environment, Amazon, and other large American companies, can make a difference for the tens of millions of low-paid workers who have thus far been left behind."

2,2018-11-19," Amazon's decision to open secondary headquarters in New York and near Washington sends a clear message: There is no Bezos ex Machina on the way for struggling cities, no single big gift from the heavens that will change everything. Instead, we're living in a world where a small number of superstar companies choose to locate in a handful of superstar cities where they have the best chance of recruiting superstar employees. But what's the economic future for a Hartford or Akron or Tulsa or the countless smaller towns and rural areas that didn't get so much as a serious look from Amazon? Some promising answers are bubbling up, although there may not be a single plan that all the people who study these issues can agree upon. A new paper by Clara Hendrickson, Mark Muro and Bill Galston at the Brookings Institution aims to summarize the facts about these regional divides, as well as how policy contributes to them and how it could help reduce them. They argue for heavy investment in digital skills, even in areas without a large existing high-tech sector. They seek new channels to ensure that businesses in struggling areas have access to capital, including small-business lending from banks and venture capital for start-ups. Parts of rural America lack fast broadband internet, a big disadvantage that the authors want to see addressed. They urge heavy federal investment in 10 or so ""growth pole"" midsize cities that are close to struggling smaller towns and can serve as economic drivers. And finally, they suggest more federal support for people who want to move to greater economic opportunity — a countermeasure for one of the more surprising trends of the last generation, a decline in Americans' mobility in pursuit of better jobs. The authors also point out things they think haven't worked in reducing regional inequality. Using tax incentives to try to poach companies from elsewhere, for example, tends to weaken communities' tax bases, while any growth benefits are zero sum, at least in economywide terms. The authors are similarly skeptical of large-scale infrastructure projects, arguing that such efforts in Europe, called ""cohesion policy,"" have tended to create nice roads and bridges in remote, poorer areas, while doing little to help incomes and employment rise in those areas over time. ""What's increasingly clear after the 2016 election is that the forces that have been really good for the economy in the aggregate, like globalization and technological change, create local shocks that are extremely powerful,"" Ms. Hendrickson said.  Their work is only the latest in efforts to wrestle with potential policy answers. In one of a series of papers published by the Hamilton Project, David Neumark of the University of California, Irvine, described a plan in which the federal government could subsidize the wages of newly hired workers in extremely poor areas. The subsidies would be 100 percent at first before tapering off — in hope of pulling more people into the labor force so they can develop skills that will allow them to earn a nonsubsidized wage. In another, Tracy Gordon of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center argued for rejiggering the formulas to set federal grants related to Medicaid, highway funding and other infrastructure spending so as to better reflect the economic conditions in different places. And the economists E. Jason Baron, Shawn Kantor and Alexander Whalley argued for expansion of a program meant to ensure that innovations developed at universities are spread to nearby employers. Steve Case, whose venture capital firm Revolution has worked to advance entrepreneurship outside the big coastal tech hubs, said, ""With the Amazon second headquarters, if the result isn't what people may have wanted, it could still help jump-start a discussion around regional innovation that could lead to better results down the road. ""I'm just eager for it to move into action so there's less of a feeling of being left behind and more optimism about the future."" Mr. Case, who calls his effort ""Rise of the Rest,"" focuses on the funding dimension of entrepreneurship, and is seeking to encourage the big venture capital firms in Silicon Valley to explore opportunities in cities like Nashville and Columbus, Ohio. He wants to encourage the growth of homegrown regional firms and networks of angel investors who might spur the next generation of companies in smaller cities. At the Economic Innovation Group, a tech industry-backed research outfit, the ideas veer more toward getting people the training and education they need. ""We have to leverage universities better,"" said John Lettieri, the group's president. ""How do we make them healthy, how do we upgrade the ones that need upgrading, make them more research focused?"" He also mentions an overhauled immigration policy to help attract more people with advanced skills, especially to struggling regions, and changes to labor laws such as banning the ""noncompete"" clauses that make it hard for people to switch jobs. Reading the various academic papers, think-tank policy briefs and business pitches makes it clear there's no conventional wisdom on how to address these issues. But there are a range of possibilities for a politician to choose from in shaping an agenda. Even as Washington prepares for divided government, regional development is one area where ideological lines are not calcified. There may be some room for deal making, as with the Jobs Act, aimed at spurring small business, that was passed by a Republican Congress and signed by President Obama. Even if that doesn't turn out to be the case, candidates for the presidency in 2020 have a huge political opportunity to pull together a policy approach that sends a message that the whole country can enjoy the benefits of prosperity, not just a handful of rich regions. For the people most in the thick of the research on the issue, there's a sense of urgency — but also a feeling of modesty in facing this complex challenge. ""While we may not know the complete and perfect solutions,"" said Mr. Muro of Brookings, ""we do know that we need to get started with the experiments."""
3,2018-11-19," Apple was worth more than $1 trillion at the start of November. Now, it's valued at $880 billion. The mighty tech titans and their seemingly endless pipeline of profits, which powered one of the longest bull markets in stocks, are looking a little less invincible. Shares of Google's parent company, Alphabet, are down more than 10 percent since the market peaked, while Facebook and Amazon have dropped more than 20 percent. Investors' faith has been eroded by slowing growth and a trade war with China, as well as a steady stream of revelations about privacy lapses, security issues and mismanagement. If tech stocks cannot shake the fears, the rest of the market could feel the pain.  The sheer bulk of the technology companies gives them outsize influence over the market — in both directions. The tumult in tech on Monday pushed major stock market indexes into negative territory for November, leaving investors clinging to a gain of less than 1 percent for the year. The sentiment spilled over into European and Asian markets on Tuesday, with European blue-chip stocks reaching the lowest mark in about three weeks. In Asia, trade concerns helped to push the stocks of Chinese semiconductor makers and other big technology companies into the red. ""You're seeing extreme selling in the only favored area that everybody ran to,"" said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist with the brokerage firm Canaccord Genuity in New York. The stock market would seem disconnected from the rest of the American economy. Unemployment remains low and growth is on track for its best annual performance since 2005. Third-quarter profits in the S&P 500 companies are expected to be up 28 percent, according to data company Refinitiv. But investors are increasingly skittish about companies' prospects. Europe and China are facing economic weakness, while margins could be pinched by higher interest rates and rising labor costs. ""There's definitely a slowdown underway globally,"" said James Bianco, president of financial market research firm Bianco Research in Chicago. ""The U.S. has definitely been stronger than the rest of the world. But the fear is, that can't hold. If the rest of the world slows down, that will eventually slow us, too."" Shares in industrial companies, viewed as particularly vulnerable to rising trade tensions with China, have dropped more than 10 percent since September. Economically sensitive financial stocks have slid 7.5 percent. Shares of homebuilders, which are vulnerable to rising rates, have fallen more than 30 percent. The potential for higher borrowing costs is also weighing on smaller companies that often borrow money by issuing floating rate debt, which can become more difficult to pay off as interest rates rise. The Russell 2000 index of small capitalization stocks is down 14 percent from its high.  ""This is simply a continuation of the recent repricing of risk, or growth scare, that we've basically been seeing since the end of September,"" said Talley Leger, an equity strategist with Oppenheimer Funds.  When the stock market hit its peak in September, technology had led the way, accounting for 50 percent of the gains for the year. The tech giants, at first, seemed immune to the sell-off that followed on broader economic worries.  Not anymore. Through Friday, roughly a quarter of the market's decline since September was because of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Alphabet, according to data collected by S&P Capital IQ. The sharp sell-off on Monday will only add to that tally.  Investors appear especially focused on any signs that extraordinary profits generated by these giant tech companies are under threat.  The specter of regulation is looming over the shares of Facebook, as it deals with the fallout and costs from a data breach, privacy lapses and management missteps. The pressure has only been amplified by renewed scrutiny over its response to Russian efforts to use it to influence the 2016 presidential election. The stock dropped another 5.7 percent on Monday.  Alphabet likewise faces a regulatory crack down on business practices in Europe, and concern from elected officials in the United States about political bias. Its shares fell nearly 4 percent Monday. Regulation broadly is worrying technology investors. Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, has been warning that the new rules for the industry are ""inevitable,"" as he told Axios in an interview that aired on Sunday.  ""I'm a big believer in the free market. But we have to admit when the free market is not working,"" he said, ""I think the Congress and the administration at some point will pass something."" Whether technology stocks can slough off the worries will depend, in part, on whether the companies can continue to deliver strong earnings growth even if the global economy does soften significantly. Recent earnings reports from major tech companies have done little to reassure investors.  Soft demand for Apple's new phones has hurt its shares and those of its suppliers. The month started with Apple issuing a lower-than-expected forecast for sales. Last week, a supplier warned investors that one of its biggest customers had cut orders.  Since Apple's share price peaked at just over $232 on Oct. 3, the stock has plummeted by nearly 20 percent, lopping more than $200 billion off the company's market value. Its shares were down nearly 4 percent Monday. Amazon reported a slowdown in its core retail revenue growth in late October, sending the shares lower. To investors, who often view revenue numbers as a good gauge of the strength of demand in the economy, that was more important than the $2.9 billion in profit the company reported. But if they actually produce the numbers that Wall Street analysts expect, the recent slump in large technology stocks could present a buying opportunity for some investors. Key valuation measures of Apple and Alphabet hit multiyear highs this summer. But the recent drop has left those valuations substantially lower. Prices of Facebook and Amazon are relatively low compared with expected profits, meaning these stocks look ""cheap"" for certain investors.  But they might have to get even cheaper before investors are tempted to snap them up. That's why some expect the sentiment in the market to get much worse before stocks can resume their climb.  ""I'm sort of looking for a little more bearishness,"" said King Lip, chief strategist at the wealth management company Baker Avenue. "
0,2018-11-20," [What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] After announcing a deal to bring an Amazon headquarters to New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio might have expected to be taking a victory lap, having beat out hundreds of other elected leaders from around the country who also wanted to boast about new jobs in their region. Instead, they have spent the last week doing damage control. So far, it isn't working. On Tuesday, two of the most outspoken critics of the deal, State Senator Michael Gianaris and City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, said that state officials had invited them to join an as-yet-unannounced community advisory committee that would provide input on planning but would have no ultimate veto. They refused. ""They are trying very hard to move from announcement to implementation, and we do not accept the announcement,"" Mr. Gianaris said of how he believes the state, the city and Amazon moved to complete the deal. ""That's why we're not participating in this charade."" Mr. Van Bramer took a similar view. ""I think it's going to help get us what we want,"" he said of his refusal to join the committee. ""Because what we want is to stop this bad deal."" Both men represent Long Island City, the neighborhood in Queens where Amazon agreed to set up new offices and where Mr. Gianaris and Mr. Van Bramer said there has been strong opposition to the deal, which could total $3 billion in state and city incentives for the highly-valued company. Critics have complained that the negotiations, held secretly between top officials from the Cuomo and de Blasio administrations, did not solicit the views of people who live in Long Island City, the semi-industrial neighborhood that has grown rapidly in recent years. Many residents were angered after the presentation of the deal last week at a news conference, leading to at least one protest. Those in favor of the agreement, politicians and residents, have said that the economic benefits from the deal would far outstrip the cost in tax breaks and a $500 million state grant that were offered to Amazon. The roll out suffered, said one person familiar with the negotiations, because state and city officials were only told 18 hours before the official announcement that the deal was done. In recent days, Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo have appeared on radio and television promoting the large number of jobs that could result from the deal and also to aggressively rebut an argument by some critics that Amazon would have come to New York City without government inducements. Each has written an essay in defense of the deal. State officials are now promising to hold a public meeting about Amazon next month. Mr. Cuomo, in an essay on his state website, wrote that while he appreciated ""the anxiety of the neighboring community,"" that the ""answer for a smart society is not to stop growing but rather to manage the growth,"" something he said that the deal accomplished. He lambasted opponents for whom ""symbolism reigns over reality"" and lashed out at media organizations, including The New York Times, that have written critical editorials but have also benefited from tax incentives in the past. Mr. de Blasio, in The Daily News, wrote that not only should New Yorkers be proud of the deal, but so should his base of political progressives — some of whom have been openly critical of the mayor. Meanwhile, state and city officials have been quietly trying to cajole opponents into supporting the deal by phone and in person. ""It's fair to say that some regret was expressed about how things were handled"" during the rollout of the Amazon deal, said Mr. Van Bramer, describing his meeting on Monday with top officials from the state's economic development arm, Empire State Development, including its president, Howard Zemsky. Later that day, he met with James Patchett, the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation. Amazon, too, has reached out to Mr. Van Bramer and Mr. Gianaris to set up a meeting. (Mr. Gianaris said he had already turned them down.) The community advisory committee is required as part of the state-run process being used to develop the waterfront land along the East River where Amazon will build a headquarters. The committee could not alter the incentive package, but it could have a say in the shape of the buildings that will house Amazon. In Long Island, a similar committee helped limit the height of a new hotel as part of a development near the Belmont racetrack. Mr. Zemsky said in a statement that the committee was the ""best way to achieve maximum benefits"" for the community. ""We want input from everyone,"" he added. Eric F. Phillips, Mr. de Blasio's press secretary, said that City Hall remains ""committed to engaging local stakeholders."" Catherine Nolan, the state assemblywoman who represents Long Island City, said she was in favor of the community's involvement, even if she did not back every part of the Amazon deal. ""Obviously I'm not for the heliport; Nobody is for the heliport,"" she said of helicopter landing rights included in the deal for Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos. She said she would advocate for community meeting space, walk-in access for job applicants and no employee cafeteria — so Amazon workers could be encouraged to eat in the neighborhood. None of the state officials involved in the deal felt that it was rolled out in an ideal manner, said a person with direct knowledge of the conversations. A prime reason, the person said, was the roughly 18-hour window between when Amazon confirmed to them that the deal was done and when the company issued its news release officially making the agreement public. Mr. de Blasio, for his part, did empathize with opponents during an interview on Monday with NY1's Errol Louis. ""If you were a councilman, you would complain if you hadn't been brought in?"" Mr. Louis asked, referring to the negotiations. ""Yeah, I think so,"" the mayor replied. ""But I also would say that some things are truly exceptional."""

3,2018-11-20," [What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] After announcing a deal to bring an Amazon headquarters to New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio might have expected to be taking a victory lap, having beat out hundreds of other elected leaders from around the country who also wanted to boast about new jobs in their region. Instead, they have spent the last week doing damage control. So far, it isn't working. On Tuesday, two of the most outspoken critics of the deal, State Senator Michael Gianaris and City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, said that state officials had invited them to join an as-yet-unannounced community advisory committee that would provide input on planning but would have no ultimate veto. They refused. ""They are trying very hard to move from announcement to implementation, and we do not accept the announcement,"" Mr. Gianaris said of how he believes the state, the city and Amazon moved to complete the deal. ""That's why we're not participating in this charade."" Mr. Van Bramer took a similar view. ""I think it's going to help get us what we want,"" he said of his refusal to join the committee. ""Because what we want is to stop this bad deal."" Both men represent Long Island City, the neighborhood in Queens where Amazon agreed to set up new offices and where Mr. Gianaris and Mr. Van Bramer said there has been strong opposition to the deal, which could total $3 billion in state and city incentives for the highly-valued company. Critics have complained that the negotiations, held secretly between top officials from the Cuomo and de Blasio administrations, did not solicit the views of people who live in Long Island City, the semi-industrial neighborhood that has grown rapidly in recent years. Many residents were angered after the presentation of the deal last week at a news conference, leading to at least one protest. Those in favor of the agreement, politicians and residents, have said that the economic benefits from the deal would far outstrip the cost in tax breaks and a $500 million state grant that were offered to Amazon. The roll out suffered, said one person familiar with the negotiations, because state and city officials were only told 18 hours before the official announcement that the deal was done. In recent days, Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo have appeared on radio and television promoting the large number of jobs that could result from the deal and also to aggressively rebut an argument by some critics that Amazon would have come to New York City without government inducements.

6,2018-11-20," A little over a year ago, Amazon invited cities and states to offer bids for a proposed second headquarters. This set off a mad scramble over who would gain the dubious privilege of paying large subsidies in return for worsened traffic congestion and higher housing prices. (Answer: New York and greater D.C.) But not everyone was in the running. From the beginning, Amazon specified that it would put the new facility only in a Democratic congressional district. O.K., that's not literally what Amazon said. It only limited the competition to ""metropolitan areas with more than one million people"" and ""urban or suburban locations with the potential to attract and retain strong technical talent."" But in the next Congress the great majority of locations meeting those criteria will, in fact, be represented by Democrats. Over the past generation, America's regions have experienced a profound economic divergence. Rich metropolitan areas have gotten even richer, attracting ever more of the nation's fastest growing industries. Meanwhile, small towns and rural areas have been bypassed, forming a sort of economic rump left behind by the knowledge economy. Amazon's headquarters criteria perfectly illustrate the forces behind that divergence. Businesses in the new economy want access to large pools of highly educated workers, which can be found only in big, rich metropolitan areas. And the location decisions of companies like Amazon draw even more high-skill workers to those areas. In other words, there's a cumulative, self-reinforcing process at work that is, in effect, dividing America into two economies. And this economic division is reflected in political division. In 2016, of course, the parts of America that are being left behind voted heavily for Donald Trump. News organizations responded with many, many, many profiles of rural Trump supporters sitting in diners. But this was, it turns out, fighting the last war. Trumpism turned America's lagging regions solid red, but the backlash against Trumpism has turned its growing regions solid blue. Some of the reporters interviewing guys in diners should have been talking to college-educated women in places like California's Orange County, a former ultraconservative stronghold that, come January, will be represented in Congress entirely by Democrats. Why have lagging regions turned right while successful regions turned left? It doesn't seem to be about economic self-interest. True, Trump promised to bring back traditional jobs in manufacturing and coal mining — but that promise was never credible. And the orthodox Republican policy agenda of cutting taxes and shrinking social programs, which is basically what Trump is following in practice, actually hurts lagging regions, which depend a lot on things like food stamps and disability payments, much more than it hurts successful areas. Furthermore, there is little if any support in voting data for the notion that ""economic anxiety"" drove people to vote for Trump. As documented in ""Identity Crisis,"" an important new book analyzing the 2016 election, what distinguished Trump voters wasn't financial hardship but ""attitudes related to race and ethnicity."" Yet these attitudes aren't divorced from economic change. Even if they're personally doing well, many voters in lagging regions have a sense of grievance, a feeling that they're being disrespected by the glittering elites of superstar cities; this sense of grievance all too easily turns into racial antagonism. Conversely, however, the transformation of the G.O.P. into a white nationalist party alienates voters — even white voters — in those big, successful metropolitan areas. So the regional economic divide becomes a political chasm. Can this chasm be bridged? Honestly, I doubt it. We can and should do a lot to improve the lives of Americans in lagging regions. We can guarantee access to health care and raise their incomes with wage subsidies and other policies (in fact, the earned-income tax credit, which helps low-wage workers, already disproportionally benefits workers in low-income states). But restoring these regions' dynamism is much harder, because it means swimming against a powerful economic tide. And the sense of being left behind can make people angry even if their material needs are taken care of. That is what we see, for example, in the former East Germany: Despite huge financial aid from the west and generous social programs, ""Ossis"" feel aggrieved by what they see as second-class status, and they have given many of their votes to extreme right-wing parties. So the bitter division we see in America — the ugliness infecting our politics — may have deep economic roots, and there may be no practical way to make it go away. But the ugliness doesn't have to win. Most rural white voters still support Trumpism, but they aren't a majority, and in the midterms a significant number of those voters also broke with the white nationalist agenda. America, then, is a divided nation, and is likely to stay that way for a while. But the better angels of our nature can still prevail."
7,2018-11-20," Soon after Hibaq Mohamed immigrated to Minneapolis from Kenya, where she had been living as a refugee, in 2016 she got a job at a new Amazon warehouse near the city. At first, she enjoyed packing boxes for delivery to consumers.  But over time, she said, Amazon required her and her co-workers to pack at a faster rate, at least 230 items an hour, up from 160. Ms. Mohamed, who is Muslim, said that Amazon let her take paid breaks to pray, as required by state law, but that her managers had told her that she still needed to keep pace. ""There is just pressure,"" Ms. Mohamed, 24, said. ""The people they don't fire worry one day they will be fired."" Ms. Mohamed and scores of East African colleagues, many of them, like her, born in Somalia, responded in an unusual way for Amazon workers: They organized to complain.  Now, tied together by a close cultural connection and empowered by a tight labor market, they appear to be the first known group in the United States to get Amazon management to negotiate.  After modest protests over the summer, the workers have had two private meetings with management in recent months. Labor organizers and researchers said they were not aware of Amazon coming to the table previously in the United States amid pressure from workers, even for private discussions. Last week, Amazon offered some compromises at its facilities in the Minneapolis area. The company said it would require a general manager and a Somali-speaking manager to agree on any firings related to productivity rates, designate a manager to respond to individual complaints within five days and meet with workers quarterly.  By Saturday night, though, a group of about 40 workers had decided the compromises were insufficient, with a primary concern being the pace at which they are expected to work. They voted to stage a large protest and walkout on Dec. 14, in the thick of the holiday season. ""Each community is a little different, and in each one, we work to ensure our employees have a great experience with the most important element being our direct connection to our employees,"" Amazon said in a statement.  Ashley Robinson, a company spokeswoman, added that the company did not see its work with the East African workers as a negotiation but rather as a form of community engagement similar to its outreach efforts with veterans and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees.  To workers, the formal meetings were the result of more than a year of organizing by the Awood Center, a nonprofit focused on helping East African workers.  ""Nobody would assume a Muslim worker, with limited language skills, in the middle of Minnesota can be a leader in a viable fight against one of the biggest employers in the world and bring them to the table,"" said Abdirahman Muse, Awood's executive director. Amazon has sought to squeeze more profit out of its operations as growth slows. Brian Olsavsky, the company's finance chief, told investors in October that ""getting better efficiencies"" from operations was a corporate priority.  The company now has more than 110 so-called fulfillment centers across the country, and other outposts that handle logistics. Each is like a mini-city, as another company spokeswoman once described them, with a unique culture and demographics. Amazon opened a warehouse the size of 20 football fields in the suburb of Shakopee in 2016. It needed more than 1,000 workers to operate it, and the local unemployment rate was around 3.5 percent. That left the company with a limited labor pool to hire from. Immigrants make up a growing share of Minnesota's work force, particularly in low-skilled jobs.  Somali refugees began resettling in the area in the 1990s, fleeing the country's growing violence and civil war. More than 46,000 Somali-born residents and their children live in the state. About four out of five live at or near the poverty level.  Amazon recruited East African immigrants heavily with local advertisements and billboards. Hundreds signed up through the Confederation of Somali Community, a nonprofit. For a while, Amazon ran buses to Shakopee from the Minneapolis neighborhood of Cedar-Riverside, known as Little Mogadishu, and the company has spaces at local warehouses dedicated to prayer and the ritual washing custom in Islam. Sixty percent of Amazon's 3,000 workers in the region are East African, Awood estimates, but the group has found only one manager who speaks Somali. Amazon said that the number of East Africans was notably lower, and that four of its managers in the area spoke Somali. For one of the meetings with workers, in September, Amazon flew in from Texas a Muslim manager who works on accommodating Islamic practices. He was originally from Libya. Safia Ahmed Ibrahim, 52, said that in Somalia, she worked for American and United Nations aid groups before fleeing to a refugee camp in Ethiopia. She was hired to work at an Amazon sorting facility in 2016.  ""I worked hard, and I got employee of the month,"" she said. It was the first time she really loved a job, she said, and she remains impressed by the business built by Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder. But after Ms. Ibrahim returned from breast cancer treatment, a new manager scolded her for working slowly, she said. She felt the manager did not see her as a woman who had worked for aid groups, overcome breast cancer and raised a daughter who got into medical school just five years after arriving in the United States. Instead, she said, the new manager saw her as a worker who, on one particular day, was slow. A white co-worker stood up for Ms. Ibrahim, she said, and the manager apologized.  ""The new managers are like military — they don't give you respect,"" Ms. Ibrahim said. ""At the beginning, I was paying attention to Awood, but finally the pressure they were talking about became the reality that I see every day."" Awood said it had connected with hundreds of workers at the Shakopee warehouse and nearby facilities, with support from local mosques and community leaders. It shares space with the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations at a Lutheran church and has political allies. Ilhan Omar, elected this month as one of the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress, has attended an Awood event, as has her fellow Democrat Tim Walz, the incoming governor. Awood has four employees and is financed by grants and the Service Employees International Union, Mr. Muse said. A Somali immigrant himself, Mr. Muse worked for the union organizing home health aides and then as a senior policy aide for the former mayor of Minneapolis before joining Awood this year.  By the time he arrived, many recent immigrants were already connecting with one another as Amazon workers because of the company's initial recruitment campaign and coordinated transportation. Workers talked about Awood during breaks and car pools.  They have a WhatsApp text message group and have held several smaller actions to build awareness of their organizing and concerns. After workers at one of the facilities near Minneapolis planned to wear light blue, the color of the Somali flag, on the same day, Amazon said it would build a dedicated prayer space there. When Amazon's annual Prime Day shopping event coincided with Ramadan, they held a protest seeking lighter workloads during the fast. ""One thing to know about our community — we talk a lot on the phone and chat over coffee,"" Mr. Muse said. ""That makes organizing easier."" Awood has also found leverage in the number of East African workers and the time of year.  ""Because there is such a density in that work force, at this stage in the game, Amazon would have a very difficult time replacing that many workers, particularly at this peak season,"" said Beth Gutelius, a researcher at the University of Illinois at Chicago with a focus on warehouses.  Mr. Muse said Awood's goal was not to unionize. No unions represent Amazon workers in the United States, although a group is trying to organize employees at Whole Foods, which Amazon owns.  Brishen Rogers, a labor law professor at Temple University in Philadelphia, said union-organizing drives were long and grueling, coming down to a yes-or-no vote. Oftentimes, Professor Rogers said, worker centers like Awood that organize along affinity lines of culture or religion can force change.  ""It is a perfectly legitimate way for workers to exercise collective voice in the work force,"" he said. Khadra Kassim, 31, was three months pregnant when she went to work for Amazon in 2017. After lifting a heavy box in the summer heat, she grew faint and fell down. She was bleeding and, fearing a miscarriage, went to Amazon's in-house medical clinic. There, she said, staff members said they could not help her and did not offer to call an ambulance or her family. She had hoped for at least some compassionate treatment.  Amazon does not comment on individual cases, Ms. Robinson, the company spokeswoman, said. But she said the company worked to reduce safety risks, had climate-controlled warehouses and accommodated medical needs. Ms. Kassim spent several months of unpaid leave on bed rest, and gave birth to a healthy girl in December. When she returned to work, co-workers told her that something had changed while she was gone: Awood had begun organizing.  ""I said, 'I'm in,'"" she recalled. ""'I want to get my rights.'"""
8,2018-11-20," [What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox] When Andy Byford, the New York City subway leader, met with Amazon executives during the summer, Mr. Byford boasted that Long Island City in Queens was a transit wonderland ready to serve their army of workers. The reality is far less rosy. Long Island City does have half a dozen subway lines, the Long Island Rail Road, buses and ferry boats. But the picture Mr. Byford painted glosses over the enormous challenges facing the city's transportation network, which regularly struggles to get millions of New Yorkers where they are going. The subway is still maddeningly unreliable more than a year after it was declared to be in a state of emergency. Last week, a relatively modest snowstorm paralyzed traffic across the region. That same day, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the subway and buses, announced it was facing a budget crisis and might have to drastically raise fares or cut service. Still, Mr. Byford was optimistic about the system's ability to handle a potential influx of 25,000 workers in Long Island City, the site Amazon picked for one of two new locations, along with a suburb in Virginia. ""This is obviously part of the reason — a large reason I would suggest — why Amazon was attracted to Long Island City,"" Mr. Byford told reporters last Thursday after an M.T.A. board meeting. ""It already has a rich transport-transit offer."" But Jimmy Van Bramer, the city councilman who represents the neighborhood, said one of the main subway lines serving the area, the No. 7, was already crowded and miserable and that Amazon's arrival would only worsen the problem. ""If you can't get on those trains or if those trains aren't reliable, then it is not transportation rich,"" he said. ""The every day experience of riders today is one where you literally have to fight your way onto these trains and that's if they come."" Mr. Van Bramer, who opposes the nearly $2 billion in incentives Amazon was promised from the state, said he had taken the No. 7 train to City Hall on Monday morning and urged Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio — two boosters of the Amazon deal — to do the same. ""It was packed when I got on in Sunnyside,"" Mr. Van Bramer said. ""It stopped and was delayed several times into City Hall this morning. That's every day."" In Seattle, Amazon runs commuter shuttles for its employees, and the company agreed this year to contribute $1.5 million to improve public transit. Shuttles would not work as well in New York, Mr. Van Bramer said, because Long Island City is already clogged with traffic from the Queensboro Bridge and the Queens-Midtown Tunnel. Amazon's New York headquarters will be located along the East River, in an area of Queens known as Anable Basin — now possibly to be rechristened Amazon Basin. There are two nearby stations on the No. 7 line: Court Square and Vernon Boulevard-Jackson Avenue, both of which have seen a major increase in ridership in recent years. There is also a stop on the city-run ferry system, though ferries carry far fewer commuters than trains. Some Amazon employees could live in Manhattan and take the subway to Queens, in the opposite direction as most commuters who are traveling to work in Manhattan, Mr. Byford said. Others could walk or bike. ""I don't think we need to assume that all of them will be piling on the 7 line,"" Mr. Byford said. A contingent of Amazon workers might also live in Brooklyn and take the G train to Long Island City. The G train — the only major subway line that does not travel to Manhattan — has long been mocked for its truncated trains that are shorter than station platforms. But its ridership is growing and when another subway line, the L train, is shut down next year for repairs, trains on the G line will double their length from four cars to eight. Mr. Byford said he would consider allowing G trains to stay in their longer configuration after the L train closure to accommodate Amazon workers, noting that he would have to consider ridership levels and how many train cars are available. But Mr. Van Bramer said the transit agency should be thinking much more ambitiously in preparing for Amazon's impact. ""It's like putting your finger in the hole of a dam that's about to collapse,"" he said. ""It's just not going to be enough."" During his meeting with Amazon, Mr. Byford said he had trumpeted his broader vision for the subway: A sweeping modernization plan, known as Fast Forward, that could cost $40 billion over ten years. But his proposal has not been funded. And now the M.T.A. says it needs additional funding to avoid huge fare increases or severe service cuts. Transit advocates have called on Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who controls the subway, to approve a transit funding plan in Albany next year, including a proposal known as congestion pricing that would toll drivers entering the busiest parts of Manhattan. ""If Albany doesn't approve congestion pricing this year and fund Fast Forward, all of the things Andy Byford is promising Amazon are all of a sudden a lot more precarious,"" said Nick Sifuentes, executive director of Tri-State Transportation Campaign, an advocacy group. The No. 7 line is currently being upgraded with a new signal system that should allow the agency to run two additional trains each hour. But an extra two trains would only carry about 2,500 additional passengers each hour — a small portion of Amazon's eventual work force, Mr. Sifuentes noted. Amazon's decision has also brought renewed attention to a proposal by Mr. de Blasio to build a streetcar along the waterfront in Brooklyn and Queens, formally known as the Brooklyn-Queens Connector, or BQX. But the plan has stalled over questions about how to pay for it. In announcing the Amazon deal, Mr. de Blasio said it reinforced the need for a streetcar in the area where, he said, the ""gravity economically in New York City is shifting to the Brooklyn and Queens waterfront."" ""The BQX is going to be a crucial part of the equation,"" Mr. de Blasio said. Some transit advocates were disappointed that the state did not require Amazon to pay for transit upgrades as part of the deal. There is a model for such an agreement: In 2015, a developer won approval to build a skyscraper near Grand Central Terminal in exchange for $220 million in transit upgrades near the site. At Court Square, a busy station in Long Island City on the E, G, M and No. 7 lines, the number of weekday riders grew last year to about 23,600, from about 18,600 riders in 2012. The Vernon Boulevard-Jackson Avenue station saw its weekday ridership grow to 15,700 last year, from 11,500 in 2012. The deal included a provision for Amazon to pay into an infrastructure fund controlled by the city's Economic Development Corporation to fund neighborhood improvements like sidewalks, utility relocations, transportation and public spaces. But some criticized the fund as too small and narrow. ""It's not like it goes to buses or improving the subway,"" Mr. Sifuentes said. ""It wouldn't make much of a dent."""
9,2018-11-20," Trevor Noah returns to Netflix with a new stand-up special. And the ""Masterpiece"" adaptation of ""Little Women"" lands on Amazon. TREVOR NOAH: SON OF PATRICIA (2018) on Netflix. Trevor Noah, host of ""The Daily Show"" and author of the memoir ""Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood,"" is back with a second Netflix comedy special after releasing ""Afraid of the Dark"" last year. Ever since Noah, the late-night comic, succeeded Jon Stewart in 2015 — just as the United States was gearing up for the presidential election — he's been unpacking American politics with a healthy dose of tongue-in-cheek humor. Here he shares a startling realization: ""We're living through a time when we are all learning about the presidency at the same time as the president. That's never happened."" LE CORBEAU (1948) on Mubi. An anonymous writer begins a smear campaign against a young doctor (Pierre Fresnay) by sending letters to hundreds of French villagers in this drama by Henri-Georges Clouzot. The mysterious notes lead to lethal consequences and reveal the seemingly idyllic community's darker side. The film, produced by a German production company during the Nazi occupation, caused a stir upon its release. LITTLE WOMEN on Amazon. If you would welcome yet another other adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's coming-of-age classic with open arms, stream this mini-series that ran on PBS as part of ""Masterpiece."" The three hourlong episodes are pleasantly binge-worthy, but those loyal to the novel may walk away disappointed, Mike Hale wrote in his review for The New York Times: ""What we get is a fairly faithful rendition of the book's events that lacks the warmth and depth of feeling that make the book worth reading."" THE FINAL TABLE on Netflix. Foodies looking for a cooking competition with more oomph than ""The Great British Baking Show"" may find enough action in this new international series. Twelve teams of elite chefs from around the world are judged by nine culinary stars, and each episode focuses on an ethnic cuisine. There to help the judges are celebrity ambassadors including Dax Shepard, Colin Hanks and Hasan Minhaj. BROADWAY DANNY ROSE (1984) 8 p.m. on TCM. Woody Allen stars as the titular character, a talent agent whose eccentric clients have little to offer — except for the washed-up lounge singer Lou (Nick Apollo Forte). This black-and-white comedy picks up when Lou lands a comeback gig at the Waldorf-Astoria and asks Danny to show up as the boyfriend of Lou's mistress, Tina (Mia Farrow). But that seemingly simple favor puts him at the mercy of the mob and nearly costs him his life. Like most of Allen's films, ""this one is a romance at heart,"" Janet Maslin wrote in The Times. ""But the love story here is so ingeniously submerged that the characters never express their feelings directly."""
0,2018-11-22," SYDNEY, Australia — Amazon will grant Australians access to products from its main website, walking back a decision made earlier this year that angered its customers in the country. The online retailer had announced that it would redirect Australians to a local website to comply with changes to Australian tax law. That law requires online retailers to impose a 10 percent goods and services tax on items sold and shipped from overseas. But customers complained that the move would raise prices and bar them from millions of products, some difficult to find otherwise. And it appears those concerns were heard. ""As a result of customer feedback, from 22 November Amazon customers will be able to ship eligible items from amazon.com to Australian delivery addresses,"" an Amazon spokeswoman said in a statement released early Thursday. After its initial decision to suspend exports to Australia, the company has focused on ""building the complex infrastructure needed to enable exports of low value goods to Australia and remain compliant with GST laws,"" the statement added in reference to the goods and services tax. The company's initial decision to bar Australians from gaining access to the main Amazon site drew criticism in June from Scott Morrison, the country's current prime minister and then-treasurer. ""You don't get a special deal because you're a big company or a multinational,"" Mr. Morrison said when asked whether companies would be exempt from the tax. ""I think it is disappointing that Amazon has taken this out on consumers in Australia — but that is their commercial position."" Amazon launched in Australia quietly in December following months of speculation over its potential impact on the country's retail sector. Local retailers, like neighborhood bookstores, raised concerns that the site would damage their businesses, and many welcomed the new tax on international imports, saying it would level the playing field. The reversal comes just before retailers hold their Black Friday sales — the annual frenzy of heavy discounts, and granting Australians access to the main Amazon site will could prove a timely boon for the company's efforts to draw local customers. Analysts have predicted the retail giant will capture almost half of the American e-commerce market this year. But even with access to the Amazon's main site, Australians will face some roadblocks. Third-party sellers on the site are still unable to ship to Australia, which was ""bloody frustrating,"" one customer complained on Twitter. Amazon will ""continue to work constructively with the government,"" to ensure ""a level playing field for all retailers and marketplaces,"" the Amazon spokeswoman said."
1,2018-11-22," Hopes are high in Long Island City that Amazon's plan to open a new headquarters there will bring tens of thousands more residents to a Queens neighborhood that was once heavily industrial but now has a mix of rowhouses, shiny towers, and a slowly growing collection of residential staples like grocery stores and pharmacies. The first Amazon employees will arrive in January, but because the company will add them gradually, with a goal of 40,000 hires by 2034, Long Island City won't exactly balloon overnight. And of course, some employees will decide to find a home in another area anyway. Long Island City has been one of the busiest neighborhoods for new construction in New York, according to Localize.city, a building data site. In the first six months of 2018, about 3,000 apartments were completed, representing about a quarter of all the new units in the city, and another 3,300 apartments are expected to come to market there by 2020. But in the weeks since announcing its move — one marked by contention over $1.525 billion in financial incentives from the state of New York — Amazon has already had an impact on Long Island City's residential market, according to brokers, developers and residents. Buyers are flocking, developers are circling and prices are rising. ""Once the news leaked, showings went up,"" Kerry Walton said of her two-bedroom, two-bath condop, which is listed for $815,000. The apartment was listed last spring for $885,000, then had a few price reductions because of the tepid market. The two offers that came during the spring were too low, said Ms. Walton, 75, a retired medical-school teacher now living in Cape Cod. But a few weeks ago, interest in the unit exploded. Ms. Walton said she began receiving a flurry of emails from her doormen letting her know that brokers were visiting. Then, in mid-November, an acceptable offer came in, which she wouldn't specify because a contract hadn't been signed yet, but made her ""happy."" If there is a wider pool of buyers in Long Island City, it's mostly investors — many from overseas, who are looking to cash in down the road through sublets, said Eric Benaim, the chief executive officer of Modern Spaces, a local brokerage. Modern Spaces is already working with four Amazon employees, some of them from Seattle, home to the retail empire's current headquarters. During the November 11 weekend, a few days after reports that Amazon had chosen Long Island City as the site of one of two new headquarters following a 14-month nationwide review, open-house traffic there spiked 400 percent at existing and new apartments, Mr. Benaim said. It was equally robust the next weekend. Other firms, like Halstead, saw a more modest, though still significant, increase of 250 percent. ""It's a feeding frenzy, and I've never seen it like this,"" said Brian Dusseau, a Halstead agent who has worked in the neighborhood since 2002. And the surge reverses what had been his ""roughest year."" ""A lot of people are focused on the Amazon workers that are coming,"" said Mr. Dusseau, who is currently working with one of them. ""But the fact that Amazon is basing its headquarters here is like a security blanket. It's making people comfortable buying again."" And developers are gearing up for the new demand. This month, Galerie, a 182-unit condo at 22-18 Jackson Avenue, will file required paperwork with the state to hike pricing, according to Brendan Aguayo, a managing director at Halstead Property Development Marketing, which is handling sales. Another hike is expected in December. About half of the units at the under-construction building, which has mostly one- and two-bedrooms, have accepted offers, Mr. Aguayo added, with 33 deals in the past two weeks alone. Amazon employees account for two of those deals. Prices at Galerie start at $550,000. Likewise, Corte, an 85-unit condo on 44th Drive where sales have been underway since July, has raised prices by 10 percent post-Amazon, and will raise them again, Mr. Benaim said. The Bond, a 42-unit project on 11th Street, has raised prices twice, and increases are also expected at the condo Craftsmen Townhomes, whose sales team accepted an offer from an Amazon buyer last week, according to Mr. Benaim. Tweaking prices in the midst of marketing a project is not that unusual, but it's rarer in the weeks before the winter holidays. It's also been uncommon as of late in Long Island City, brokers say, where the development market has been weak. In the third quarter, the average new condo sale price in Long Island City was $976,000, according to Halstead. That was down from an average of $1.32 million in the previous quarter and also shy of the $1.01 million average in the same quarter of 2017, the firm said. The average monthly rent for one-bedrooms across Long Island City is $3,100, according to StreetEasy.com. The average for two-bedrooms is $3,900.  Eager to embrace an Amazon wave, developers are also dusting off old plans. The Durst Organization, one of the city's largest developers, hopes to build on a huge site it has controlled for years, a Durst spokesman said. The site, at 44-02 Vernon Boulevard near Anable Basin, can accommodate 1 million square feet of apartments.  Anable Basin, a low-rise medley of docks and warehouses, is where Amazon intends to build a sprawling office complex that could total eight million square fee — and possibly a helipad, according to state documents. ""Amazon planting a flag is fabulous for the entire neighborhood,"" said Alan Suna, the chief executive of Silvercup Studios, the Long Island City movie facility that also develops apartment buildings, like the Harrison, a 120-unit condo on 44th Drive. Mr. Suna was among the local business leaders who worked on the Amazon pitch. Despite two decades of residential strides, much of Long Island City still looks like a work zone. Taxi garages dot blocks scattered with metal foundries, tile shops and the Empire City Iron Works. The sea of asphalt at the junction of Jackson Avenue and Vernon Boulevard functions as a free-for-all parking lot. Jutting out of Borden Avenue, near gleaming apartment buildings, is a Queens-Midtown Tunnel ventilation shaft. Still, development has proceeded energetically, especially in two pockets — on the banks of the East River in the Hunters Point section; and in Court Square, sandwiched between the Edward I. Koch Queensboro Bridge and the Long Island Railroad tracks. In Hunters Point, the thicket of gleaming towers by the river began to take shape in 1997 with the construction of the Citylights condop, and filled out in subsequent years with five contributions from the Elghanayan family, a major Long Island City builder. Among their high-rises are Nos. 4720, 4545 and 4610 Center Boulevard, rentals that are operated by TF Cornerstone, a family subsidiary. The cluster of buildings, which looms over the famed waterside Pepsi-Cola sign, offer ample amenities, but the area has just a handful of bars, restaurants and markets. With a pair of ferry docks, the enclave can feel closely tethered to the place it faces: Manhattan. Hunters Point is also awaiting the arrival of 5,000 new, mostly affordable apartments, courtesy of the mixed-use project Hunters Point South. A popular park is open there today. TF Cornerstone will partner with Amazon to develop a portion of Amazon's office complex, which will sit on a large site where TF cornerstone had been planning offices, workshops, stores, a school and apartments under a 2017 deal with the city. Most of that construction, including the school, is on track, according to TF Cornerstone, though the housing is no more. Further inland at Court Square, a disparate blend of offices, apartments and municipal buildings nuzzles the bridge's ramps. In addition to whatever it builds in the Anable Basin, Amazon has leased 1 million square feet of the office building at One Court Square, the 1.4 million-square-foot, blue-green spire formerly known as the Citigroup Building, where Amazon is expected to start moving employees early next year. Rockrose, another Elghanayan firm, has finished or is at work on four rentals in the area, with 2,600 apartments. Among them is the Cove at 43-12 Hunter Street, a 130-unit, 18-story offering to be completed next year. Eagle Lofts, with 790 units at 43-22 Queens Street, is currently leasing; one-bedrooms are around $3,800 a month, with a free month's rent offered as a concession. Rockrose will likely raise rents, but first Amazon workers need to arrive, said Rockrose president Justin Elghanayan. ""It will take a while before the effects filter in,"" he said. Mr. Elghanayan's projects are hardly alone. Densely packed into this area, which was rezoned in 2001, are more than a dozen other residential spires, mostly rentals. There are condos too, like Skyline Tower, an 802-unit, 778-foot giant on 23-15 44th Drive from developer Jiashu Xu that was a few floors out of the ground on a recent afternoon. Retail has been limited in Court Square, but a gourmet grocery, Foodcellar and Co., opened on Crescent Street in 2015. Xi'an Famous Foods, the trendy restaurant chain, will open on Jackson Avenue in a few months, as will City Chemist, a highly anticipated drugstore — both in Rockrose buildings. Unlike previous retail tenants, who enjoyed below-market rents in a Rockrose effort to cultivate a scene, future rents ""will be more landlord friendly than before the Amazon announcement,"" Mr. Elghanayan said. While development has been clumped in two compact sections, it has begun to spread out. New buildings are slowly popping up north of the bridge, toward Astoria. That section is also home to Queensbridge Houses, the nation's largest public-housing development. But in the middle of the neighborhood are a stream of rentals and some smaller-scale condos like the red brick Decker, on 44th Drive, and a row of three townhouses on 47th Avenue, containing 18 apartments. While not as rich in historic buildings as other parts of New York, Long Island City does offer a single-block historic district, along 45th Avenue, between 21st and 23rd Streets, which features neat rows of prewar townhouses. A two-family there recently sold for more than $2 million. Shorter three-level versions are nearby, on 23rd Street, in the shadows of the elevated 7 train tracks, and also on 11th Street. Restaurants dot Vernon Boulevard, too, like a local outpost of Corner Bistro, the West Village burger joint, and the modernistic Bellwether, which opened this year. Nearby, Murray Playground attracts families, and soccer squads. ""It has completely changed,"" said Ms. Walton of the neighborhood, to which she moved in 1998. And Amazon will accelerate more growth. ""The people will be there, so the businesses will follow. You just have to be patient."""
0,2018-11-26,"  (Want to get New York Today by email? Here's the sign-up.)  It's Monday. Weather: ☔️ Rain — again! — this afternoon and tonight. The breeze could turn gusty late in the day, as we hit a high of 51. Last year, Amazon logged more transactions on Cyber Monday than any other company, more than four times as many as the runner-up, Walmart, according to Inc. Magazine. Amazon also announced plans this month to add a headquarters in Queens, as well as one in a Virginia suburb. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio both support the deal in New York. Critics have objected to using public subsidies to help Amazon expand here. That makes today the perfect opportunity to calmly discuss Amazon. Or to protest loudly. Gothamist's story about protests targeting the company on Monday noted that the Amazon deal has been criticized by people ranging from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the newly elected progressive congresswoman representing parts of Queens and the Bronx, to The Wall Street Journal's conservative editorial board. (There's a protest at 5 p.m. in Court Square Park in Queens, though the rain will dampen it.) For perspective, I checked in with Reshma Saujani, founder of Girls Who Code, a nonprofit teaching women key skills in order to help get them employed in the well-paying, male-dominated tech sector. Ms. Saujani said she supports the Cyber Monday protests, but also noted that Amazon has supported Girls Who Code. ""Like many New Yorkers, I want to see powerful companies held accountable. I want to make sure that anyone who is receiving a public benefit from our city looks like our CITY,"" she wrote in an email. ""The gender gap in technology is an industrywide problem, and Amazon has the opportunity to be an industry leader in opening a headquarters in Queens,"" she wrote. Ms. Saujani said she would like to see Amazon make a commitment to hiring more women and people of color. Amazon has said it will invest about $2.5 billion in New York as part of the Queens deal. The company is reportedly looking to establish a pipeline from nearby LaGuardia Community College, and it has pledged to spend $5 million for training and internship programs. It has also promised to participate in ""job fairs and résumé workshops"" at the nearby Queensbridge Houses, the largest public housing complex in the nation.

0,2018-11-28," I have a faint memory of an article I read some years back detailing the grim life of a shelf picker in an Amazon warehouse. It described the arrangement of products on shelves — unlikely juxtapositions determined wholly by algorithm.  A worker's life was disorienting; you never knew where anything might be. Nail clippers might be next to stone humidifiers or HVAC filters or picture frames. The worker was given a product location and ran to it. Then another. And again. The warehouse was a game, the products little more than flippers in search of a pinball to thwack. This holiday season, you are the pinball. Amazon has recently opened Amazon 4-Star, a catchall gift shop in SoHo — about 100 feet from Balthazar and the MoMA Design Store — that's part of the company's slow seep into physical retail. It is grim. A permanent store with the harried, colorless mood of a hastily assembled clearance-sale pop-up. Lot-Less Closeouts stores have more vim and charm. Amazon 4-Star asks what would happen if the logic of the warehouse writ raw was applied to a traditional storefront. Who needs a warehouse picker when the customers can do the work themselves? Spending time browsing here was among my most dismal shopping experiences in recent memory: joyless, arbitrary, spiritually empty. And that was before a 20-something guy bounded into the store and started screaming: ""Alexa! Alexa! Alexa!"" Some of the items Amazon 4-Star hawks are Amazon products, naturally: the Amazon Echo home assistant (which ordinarily answers to ""Alexa""), the Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet, the Amazon Fire TV Stick, plenty of AmazonBasics items, including a five-way headphone splitter ($9.49, $8.07 for Prime; 4.4 rating). Run-of-the-mill vertical integration stuff. Not my ecosystem, but fine. Some sections are arranged logically: children's toys, kitchen items, smart-home tools. (I use ""section"" very loosely. On the wall, each one is perhaps a couple of feet wide.) And each item tag has a price, a lower price for Amazon Prime members (sometimes) and an average star rating (along with the number of customers who rated it). About that 4-Star name, though. Thing is, I know there's a fifth star. Four stars out of five is already a concession. What's on offer aren't the most premium products, but rather ones that are pretty good.  Add to that the fact that I found several items in the store that actually have a rating below four stars. Say, the iRobot Braava Jet 240 wet mop ($199/$169; 3.8), or Don't Lose Your Cool, ($19.99/$10.42; 2.4), a party game that includes a contraption you strap to your head that measures rises in heart rate and which presumably was tested on customers shopping here. You trust a store because you trust how it was curated. That's true whether it's Walmart or Dover Street Market. But there is little oversight here beyond the Amazon imprimatur. In several places, products are arranged by theme. Again, I use ""theme"" loosely: ""Top Selling Around NYC,"" ""Most Wished for Books on Amazon."" ""Trending Around NYC on Amazon.com."" Taxonomies I have never pondered and which are utterly useless. On the Trending table, a Lego advent calendar ($29.99; 4.7) was next to a Panasonic Arc 5 electric razor ($199.99/$99.99; 4.5), which was next to a tub of CeraVe moisturizing cream ($15.06; 4.6) and just inches from Michelle Obama's memoir, ""Becoming"" ($32.50/$19.50; 4.8).  A couple of tables away, a Big Gulp-size Yankee Candle in a surprisingly not acrid Christmas Cookie scent ($17.99; 4.1) was next to ""Less,"" a novel by Andrew Sean Greer that won the Pulitzer Prize ($15.99/$10.87; 3.7). These are chaotic arrangements, on tables set among floor paths that resemble a field maze. Decoration and filigree is minimal. There were a couple of afterthought cardboard trees on the electronic gift guide table, but not much beyond that. Almost every 10 minutes, a UPS handler would roll in a hand truck filled with those signature Amazon boxes, presumably loading up the store with inventory. Now look, I rely on Amazon Prime just like the next hypocrite, and I understand how one's needs aren't cleanly categorizable. But this store treats commerce like a tornado. On one table, there was a tossed-together collection of light winter jackets less organized than what you'd find in the Times Square H&M; underneath the table was a set of cardboard boxes with sizes written in marker on the side. Forget farm-to-table; this is pallet-to-checkout. Maybe I was using the wrong approach — absorbing the store as a whole, and not like a warehouse picker in search of a specific item. So I went through my mental inventory of home problems that need solving.  Inspired by a friend's recent purchase of a 75-inch television (insert drool emoji), I sought out the electronics section. But there was only one option, a meager 55 inches. There was an impressive-looking Sonos Beam Soundbar ($399/$349; 4.1), but that felt like something to address later, once the main itch had been scratched. Then, a manageable ask. Over Thanksgiving weekend, my mother gave serious side eye to the pan I use to make eggs, which after years of use resembles something extracted from a barn on ""American Pickers."" Easy enough. I went to the kitchen section but found that there were none.  Well, strictly speaking, there was one: a tree-ornament version, the 3.5-inch Lodge miniature skillet ($6.25/$4.69; 4.4), good for a single egg or a quick wallop on the head, which, by this point, would have been sweet relief."
0,2018-11-30," It was at a goldsmithing class in 2003 that Silvia Furmanovich knew for certain that her future lay in fine jewelry. As she watched a hunk of gold melting above a flame, ""deep inside, I knew it was the way forward for me,"" said the Brazilian jeweler, who until that point had had her own costume jewelry and aromatherapy businesses. Seeing the precious metal transform before her eyes brought back instant memories of her father, who was a goldsmith with his own jewelry atelier at home in São Paulo, Brazil, when Ms. Furmanovich was growing up. (He died when she was 17.) ""He was a huge guy with big hands, but I remember him working on tiny pieces with such skill,"" said the 61-year-old designer in a recent telephone interview from her São Paulo home. The jewelry gene runs deep in the family. Her Italian grandfather and great-grandfather also were goldsmiths, the latter for the Vatican. Ms. Furmanovich's first fine jewelry creations were intricately woven bracelets with porcelain beads, secured with the gold clasps that she made in class. These bracelets still are represented in her collection, which has grown to encompass a vast array of bold yet feminine, vibrantly colored creations. The designer was an early proponent of mixing precious materials like gold and diamonds with Brazilian semiprecious colored gemstones such as tourmalines and blue topaz, as well as with natural materials including seashells, wood and orchid petals preserved in lacquer. She also has long incorporated craft items from around the world into her designs, whether they be the antique, hand-carved wooden netsuke she found in Japan, or Rajasthani miniature paintings she commissioned from artists in Udaipur, India. ""I've always collaborated with artists and artisans to make something new,"" Ms. Furmanovich said. ""In this technological world, everything is being made by machines and we must all fight to keep traditional handicrafts alive."" It is a view shared by the Michelangelo Foundation for Creativity and Craftsmanship, a private nonprofit entity founded in Geneva in 2016 by Johann Rupert, chairman of the Swiss luxury group Richemont, and Franco Cologni, the former Cartier executive. In September, the foundation invited her to attend Homo Faber, its inaugural celebration of international craftsmanship, held in Venice. ""I've never seen such beautiful crafts in my life than in that show,"" she said. Four years ago, inspiration came from closer to home, however. She was at an exhibition in Brazil when she came across the work of an artist based in the country's remote northern region of the Amazon. The artist, who declined to be named, was born in the rain forest but had learned the art of wood marquetry as a young man, having been sent to Germany by priests who recognized his artistic potential. As soon as she saw his work, she knew she had to meet him. ""It's a long trip from São Paulo. Two planes, one hour by car and then one hour by canoe,"" she said. ""It was a risk to go but something was calling me there."" She invited him to collaborate and together they worked out how to miniaturize his and his team's work down from large-scale pictures and furniture to the wearable scale of jewelry. The initial result was a collection in which the marquetry mimicked the geometric patterns and play of light found in cut gemstones. The miniature trompe l'oeil artworks were suspended from diamonds and colored gems, including amethyst and citrine, in earrings, cuffs and minaudières. The marquetry artist incorporates minute slivers of wood in many colors in his work, including native ones such as red muirapiranga, yellow tatajuba, purple roxinho and blue carvalho. These are not dyed to achieve their vibrant effect, Ms. Furmanovich said, although sometimes the artist's team intensifies the colors through a process (which they won't share, even with her) that causes chemical reactions in the woods. They use only bark and branches salvaged from the rain-forest floor or nonnative woods left over from the local furniture industry. ""It's also great to work with a sustainable material that incorporates the concept of craftsmanship,"" she said. ""I love to work with wood; it's beautiful to work with, and you can make things on scale while keeping them lightweight."" This year, the designer took the collaboration further with Botanical, a collection based on the fertile subject of Brazil's tropical flora and fauna, inspired by her frequent trips to the rain forest. Incorporating one-of-a-kind pieces based on everything from calla lilies and pansies to multicolored rain-forest mushrooms and tropical butterflies, every pattern in their surfaces and every curve in their silhouettes is realized in minute detail. The result was particularly satisfying for Ms. Furmanovich. ""The Amazon forest is such a powerful place,"" she said. ""We have the colors, the flowers, the birds: a diversity in nature that is unparalleled. It's great to be able to show the best of our country in terms of nature, materials and craft."" She has worked with another team of Brazilian craftspeople, this time in the southeastern state of Minas Gerais, to create wood carvings to which the marquetry is applied. Ms. Furmanovich said she was supporting a reforestation effort, to replace the trees used to create the carvings. And given the recent election of Jair Bolsonaro as president of Brazil, who has threatened to roll back environmental protections on the rain forest, such initiatives are even more important now, she said. In terms of craftsmanship, she said that creating a 3-D effect in marquetry, which is normally used on flat surfaces, was the greatest challenge of the collection. ""The veneers are stiff, and they break when you fold them,"" she said. However, the effort, and frequent trips north — especially since beginning work on the Botanical collection — have been worth it, Ms. Furmanovich said. And the reaction from her clients has been overwhelming, particularly at Bergdorf Goodman in New York, where her work stands out in its jewelry salon for its color, scale and volume. ""These customers can buy what they like but I think people want something different and unique, they don't just want diamonds,"" she said. ""They want innovation."" Betty Halbreich, director of the personal shopping Solutions Department at Bergdorf Goodman, agrees. ""To gaze at Silvia's case is like traveling to a museum,"" she said. ""One's imagination takes a ride. Imagine the wood, the artisans, the jewels and where they come from. It is like a jewelry flower garden."""
1,2018-11-30," The recent killing of an American missionary by members of an isolated tribe on a small island in the Indian Ocean has reignited questions about the fate of the last few groups of people living off the grid. In an era when people across the globe are hyper-connected by technology and increasingly interlocked economies, the survival of a few dozen groups of hunter-gatherers living in complete isolation may seem extraordinary. But experts say they may not survive undisturbed for much longer. Because most of these groups are small and highly vulnerable, anthropologists and indigenous activists have been debating whether it makes more sense to leave them alone — or try to establish contact with them to offer basic medical care, such as vaccines. Here are some basic facts about the world's remaining isolated tribes. Anthropologists and activists who study the issue say it's hard to know for certain. But based on satellite images and field research, experts believe there are more than 100 communities living in isolation. The vast majority of groups live in the Amazon basin in areas that straddle Brazil and Peru. The only relatively large community outside of South America belongs to the Sentinelese, who live on North Sentinel Island. It is nominally part of India, but technically a sovereign territory. That is where John Allen Chau, the American, was killed on a mission to convert the local residents to Christianity. The Sentinelese have responded violently to past incursions by outsiders, which has led the Indian government to maintain a ""no-contact"" policy. Based on accounts from people who have ceased living in isolation, and those who have had fleeting contact with these societies, experts say members of these communities are fearful that contact with outsiders would bring disease and mistreatment. Native communities in the Amazon were ravaged when European settlers began colonizing the Americas in the 1500s and later in the 1800s when rubber tappers flooded the region. ""Many tribes in the frontier region of Brazil and Peru are probably survivors of the rubber boom who witnessed the enslavement and atrocities against indigenous peoples and fled to the headwaters of the Amazon to evade capture,"" said Jonathan Mazower, an expert on isolated communities at Survival, a London-based organization that advocates greater protection for the groups. ""The historical memory of this era is likely to have been passed down to the current generation,"" he said. Loggers, miners, cattle ranchers and drug traffickers have encroached on the territories of these groups, exposing them to violence and disease. Anthropologists at the University of Missouri who study the size and resilience of these groups, based on satellite images and photos shot from aircraft, classify the ones they track as either ""vulnerable"" or ""critical."" Brazilian prosecutors last year investigated reports of a massacre of uncontacted tribesmen by gold miners. The country's incoming president, Jair Bolsonaro, has said he wants to do away with protected indigenous lands, which are safeguarded by Brazil's Constitution, arguing that indigenous people should no longer be treated as if they live in zoos. Anthropologists and activists for isolated tribes have long wrestled with that question. Robert Walker and Kim Hill, two prominent anthropologists who study isolated societies, argued in an essay published in 2015 that it was time to reconsider the no-contact policy that governments like Brazil and Peru have maintained in recent years. ""Unless protection efforts against external threats and accidental encounters are drastically increased, the chances that these tribes will survive are slim,"" Mr. Walker and Mr. Hill wrote in the essay, published in the magazine Science. ""Disease epidemics, compounded by demographic variability and inbreeding effects, makes the disappearance of small, isolated groups very probable in the near future."" Survival disagrees, and instead calls on governments to redouble efforts to keep outsiders from the territories where these communities live. ""These uncontacted peoples make a judgment that they are better off remaining uncontacted and independent, fending for themselves,"" Mr. Mazower said. ""Where their lands are protected and their right to remain uncontacted is upheld, they live healthy lives and are totally self-sufficient."""
2,2018-11-30," It was at a goldsmithing class in 2003 that Silvia Furmanovich knew for certain that her future lay in fine jewelry. As she watched a hunk of gold melting above a flame, ""deep inside, I knew it was the way forward for me,"" said the Brazilian jeweler, who until that point had had her own costume jewelry and aromatherapy businesses. Seeing the precious metal transform before her eyes brought back instant memories of her father, who was a goldsmith with his own jewelry atelier at home in São Paulo, Brazil, when Ms. Furmanovich was growing up. (He died when she was 17.) ""He was a huge guy with big hands, but I remember him working on tiny pieces with such skill,"" said the 61-year-old designer in a recent telephone interview from her São Paulo home. The jewelry gene runs deep in the family. Her Italian grandfather and great-grandfather also were goldsmiths, the latter for the Vatican. Ms. Furmanovich's first fine jewelry creations were intricately woven bracelets with porcelain beads, secured with the gold clasps that she made in class. These bracelets still are represented in her collection, which has grown to encompass a vast array of bold yet feminine, vibrantly colored creations. The designer was an early proponent of mixing precious materials like gold and diamonds with Brazilian semiprecious colored gemstones such as tourmalines and blue topaz, as well as with natural materials including seashells, wood and orchid petals preserved in lacquer. She also has long incorporated craft items from around the world into her designs, whether they be the antique, hand-carved wooden netsuke she found in Japan, or Rajasthani miniature paintings she commissioned from artists in Udaipur, India. ""I've always collaborated with artists and artisans to make something new,"" Ms. Furmanovich said. ""In this technological world, everything is being made by machines and we must all fight to keep traditional handicrafts alive."" It is a view shared by the Michelangelo Foundation for Creativity and Craftsmanship, a private nonprofit entity founded in Geneva in 2016 by Johann Rupert, chairman of the Swiss luxury group Richemont, and Franco Cologni, the former Cartier executive. In September, the foundation invited her to attend Homo Faber, its inaugural celebration of international craftsmanship, held in Venice. ""I've never seen such beautiful crafts in my life than in that show,"" she said. Four years ago, inspiration came from closer to home, however. She was at an exhibition in Brazil when she came across the work of an artist based in the country's remote northern region of the Amazon. The artist, who declined to be named, was born in the rain forest but had learned the art of wood marquetry as a young man, having been sent to Germany by priests who recognized his artistic potential. As soon as she saw his work, she knew she had to meet him. ""It's a long trip from São Paulo. Two planes, one hour by car and then one hour by canoe,"" she said. ""It was a risk to go but something was calling me there."" She invited him to collaborate and together they worked out how to miniaturize his and his team's work down from large-scale pictures and furniture to the wearable scale of jewelry. The initial result was a collection in which the marquetry mimicked the geometric patterns and play of light found in cut gemstones. The miniature trompe l'oeil artworks were suspended from diamonds and colored gems, including amethyst and citrine, in earrings, cuffs and minaudières. The marquetry artist incorporates minute slivers of wood in many colors in his work, including native ones such as red muirapiranga, yellow tatajuba, purple roxinho and blue carvalho. These are not dyed to achieve their vibrant effect, Ms. Furmanovich said, although sometimes the artist's team intensifies the colors through a process (which they won't share, even with her) that causes chemical reactions in the woods. They use only bark and branches salvaged from the rain-forest floor or nonnative woods left over from the local furniture industry. ""It's also great to work with a sustainable material that incorporates the concept of craftsmanship,"" she said. ""I love to work with wood; it's beautiful to work with, and you can make things on scale while keeping them lightweight."" This year, the designer took the collaboration further with Botanical, a collection based on the fertile subject of Brazil's tropical flora and fauna, inspired by her frequent trips to the rain forest. Incorporating one-of-a-kind pieces based on everything from calla lilies and pansies to multicolored rain-forest mushrooms and tropical butterflies, every pattern in their surfaces and every curve in their silhouettes is realized in minute detail. The result was particularly satisfying for Ms. Furmanovich. ""The Amazon forest is such a powerful place,"" she said. ""We have the colors, the flowers, the birds: a diversity in nature that is unparalleled. It's great to be able to show the best of our country in terms of nature, materials and craft."" She has worked with another team of Brazilian craftspeople, this time in the southeastern state of Minas Gerais, to create wood carvings to which the marquetry is applied. Ms. Furmanovich said she was supporting a reforestation effort, to replace the trees used to create the carvings. And given the recent election of Jair Bolsonaro as president of Brazil, who has threatened to roll back environmental protections on the rain forest, such initiatives are even more important now, she said.

0,2018-12-01," ""Congo Tales,"" a new book published recently by Prestel, began as a call to action to save the Odzala-Kokoua National Park in the heart of the Congo Basin, which is the second-largest tropical forest in the world after the Amazon, from the threats of climate change.  It soon became a book about the stories of the people who live there.  A team including Pieter Henket, a Dutch photographer; Eva Vonk, a Dutch producer; Steve Regis ""Kovo"" N'Sondé, a Congolese artist and philosopher; his brother Wilfried N'Sondé, a Congolese writer and musician; and a group of conservationists and researchers spent five years in the basin. There, they collected and translated the tales of the people of the Mbomo region. The stories were then edited by the N'Sondé brothers, a job suited to the pair who grew up with stories passed down from their grandmother. ""These stories, through the values and symbols they carry, are our legacy,"" said Kovo N'Sondé. ""When I say our, I don't only mean Congolese citizens or Bantu peoples, I mean mankind. These stories are all about wisdom, knowledge, ethical and aesthetic principles."" A project of this nature is bound to draw scrutiny and face skepticism about exploiting native peoples and rituals. But this collaboration offers an opportunity to grapple with what an ethical approach to storytelling might look like. ""Storytelling is such a powerful thing with which we pass on information from generation to generation,"" Vonk said. ""Any authenticity I have gained is just by listening and not trying to explain."" Henket, who photographed the community members' re-enactments of the stories, viewed his presence as more about offering technical expertise, such as lighting and composition. ""What I wanted to do with the Mbomo people was to really let them tell the stories how they wanted to see it,"" he said.  Here are Henket's comments on some of the photographs in the book and their accompanying stories.  I took a portrait of the eldest people in the village because there is a saying that when the old people die it's like a library of stories burning down. That whole concept on its own is already beautiful so we wanted to build on that.  All Mbomo families have their own totem animals that represent them. We asked the kids about their family's totem animal and how they would express it. After a week of shooting, the whole village got involved and everyone wanted to be a part of it. This girl came with this simple leaf and put it on top of her head and we asked ""What are you?"" and she said, ""I'm a bird."" This boy came in wearing this dress with moons and stars on it. We asked him what totem animal he would be and he said, ""I'm a butterfly."" We asked him: ""How would you represent that?"" Together with our art director, he made this butterfly costume. We wanted to keep this story, which symbolizes how the days of the week were established, light and very much fantasy, so we created this wooden moon. All the kids wanted to be a part of this picture, and they started to come out of the forest with their own hats and their own masks. It adds to the whole goal of them telling their own stories instead of telling them to do this or do that. This story is about a fish and a crocodile becoming best friends. One day the fish says to the crocodile, would you come over and stay at my house tonight? So the crocodile stays and they have an amazing night. But then the crocodile eats the babies of the fish and so the fish says to the crocodile, I thought we were best friends. I wanted to do a picture in the river with all the children as if they were little fish eggs. These are most of the children of the people who were involved in the project.  The difficult part is deciding what parts of the story are important to tell. With photography you have to choose moments. I wanted to somehow show the fish eggs and I thought it would be a beautiful composition to have all these children sitting in the river bank.  This story about a woman trying to escape an abusive relationship is very much about female power. The casting process was super fun for this one because while we were shooting there were always a few people who stayed around us. These girls, who were in that group, were tough cool girls, and I thought they would fit perfectly for this powerful image.  The man in the middle is Bosco, and he is sort of the unofficial mayor of the village. This is a story about how all the young boys decide at one point that they want to take power from the elders so they kill all the elders. But then they realize you need the wisdom from the elders. This picture represents that realization with Bosco as the elder and his son looking at the camera. "
1,2018-12-01," Watching is The New York Times's TV and film recommendation website. Sign up for our thrice-weekly newsletter here. The holidays can be a stressful time, even in the best of families. So in this month's roundup, we've looked for the most soothing and crowd-pleasing TV series and movies coming to the major streaming services in December, with special favor bestowed upon anything nostalgic or mouthwatering. Below are the most interesting of what we've found, followed by a roundup of all the best new titles in all genres. (Streaming services occasionally change schedules without giving notice.) 'Dave'Starts streaming: Dec. 1, on HBO. What if you suddenly had a chance to be the president? It happens to an ordinary man named Dave Kovic (a versatile Kevin Kline) — but only because of his uncanny resemblance to Bill Mitchell, the actual U.S. President (also Kline). When Mitchell has a medical emergency, Dave finds himself in the Oval Office. Naturally, high jinks ensue. (It's particularly satisfying to watch him balance the budget). A fun romp for political junkies on both sides of the aisle. 'Groundhog Day'Starts streaming: Dec. 1, on Amazon. Despite being set in early February, ""Groundhog Day"" is an existential holiday movie in the same vein as ""A Christmas Carol"" or ""It's a Wonderful Life"": A smug protagonist is compelled to rethink his mortal sojourn — how he has spent his days, how he has treated people — and to realize the error of his ways. Here, the case study is condescending TV weatherman Phil Connors (a wonderfully grouchy Bill Murray) who makes an annual trek to cover the big Groundhog Day festival in Punxsutawney, Penn. — only to find himself mysteriously condemned to relive the day over and over again. Is he in purgatory? A makeshift parallel universe? He doesn't know and can't escape, so he learns to make the best of it, ultimately connecting with his fellow human beings (including WrestleMania fan Michael Shannon). Like Phil's day, this movie becomes better with endless repeat viewings. [Here is The New York Times's list of the best movies on Netflix right now.] 'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel' Season 2Starts streaming: Dec. 5, on Amazon. Now that ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" has won eight Emmy Awards, what next? How about Paris and the Catskills? Midge Maisel (Rachel Brosnahan at full sparkle) and her efforts to break into stand-up comedy in the late 1950s are still central, but the show's world has opened up, along with new opportunities for ensemble players. Some of the best moments are meticulously choreographed set pieces in which cameras and characters glide around each other, with dialogue overlapping. Rarely have scenes of people lugging furniture into a vacation cottage, or answering calls in the switchboard room, been so fascinating to watch. Midge still gets the wittiest rat-a-tat banter, of course, but now she has lots of highly entertaining help. Dizzying and delightful. 'Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle'Starts streaming: Dec. 7, on Netflix. The director and motion-capture master Andy Serkis's take on ""The Jungle Book"" is for those who prefer their anthropomorphized animals to look like they actually live in a jungle — in other words, less cute and cuddly and more scruffy and muddy. Adopted by wolves, Mowgli (Rohan Chand) struggles with his precarious place in the pack; if he can't keep up, he will be cast out. But might this wild child be able to adapt to the human world? A colonial hunter (Matthew Rhys) takes Mowgli under his wing, and Mowgli is befriended by a village woman (Freida Pinto) during Holi festivities. As Mowgli straddles the two worlds — belonging to both and to neither — the story turns dark. And no one, animal or human, gets off easy. Major plus: the stellar voice work by Benedict Cumberbatch (as the tiger Shere Khan) and Christian Bale (as the panther Bagheera). 'Nailed It! Holiday!' Starts streaming: Dec. 7, on Netflix. Some baking shows you watch to marvel at the artistry, but not ""Nailed It!"" This American series is for the barely-able-to-bake set, people who consider it a win if their pathetic attempt at patisserie resembles anything in the vicinity of say, a cake pop, a doughnut or an elaborate exercise in excess fondant. (Seriously, what is the deal with fondant, ""Nailed It!""?) These holiday episodes are a mad chef's laboratory for dreidel-shaped cake pops, polar animal confections and edible nativity scenes. ""This baby Jesus is the most delicious baby I've ever eaten,"" host Nicole Byer quips at one point. And later: ""I can't wait to eat Santa."" OK, maybe you can. 'Chilling Adventures of Sabrina: A Midwinter's Tale'Starts streaming: Dec. 14, on Netflix. You thought witches didn't celebrate the holidays? What is a Christmas tree if not a holdover from the pagan practice of keeping a Yule tree (and burning a Yule log) to ward off spirits during the darkest time of the year? In this particular winter solstice, Sabrina is more interested in welcoming spirits to the Spellman home, and in this special — which is nearly a stand-alone episode, occurring after the events of Season 1 — Sabrina conducts a séance, Susie moonlights as an elf for a store-based Santa and Madam Satan enjoys a gingerbread house. True, those gingerbread cookies look suspiciously like Sabrina and her two aunts, but … nothing to see here, right? 'Roma' Starts streaming: Dec. 14, on Netflix. In the beginning, there are only splashes of water rushing across stone tiles, then receding. Eventually we realize we are watching Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio, in her first role), a live-in domestic worker for a middle-class family in Mexico City, scrub the household driveway. The movie, shot in gorgeous black-and-white, is a moving, semi-autobiographical interpretation of the Oscar-winning director Alfonso Cuarón's own childhood in the 1970s. Cleo is modeled after his family's live-in housekeeper, Liboria Rodriguez, and Cuarón imagines the world through her eyes, noting, with intimate deal, the conflicted status of servants who are both quasi-family members and, inevitably, perpetual outsiders. A must-see. 'Isle of Dogs'Starts streaming: Dec. 22, on HBO. The story of a boy and his dog, basically. But since this is a Wes Anderson film, and it's made in painstaking stop-motion animation, there's a bit more to it than that. The boy is Atari (voiced by Koyu Rankin), and he's on a mission to rescue his loyal canine Spots (Liev Schreiber) from Trash Island, where the dogs of Megasaki have been quarantined by a cat-loving, dog-phobic mayor (Kunichi Nomura, who co-wrote the script). Anderson's whimsy is relentless as always, but depending on your reading of its usage, the movie is either a sincere tribute to, or plunders, Japanese art, cinema and music. On another level, it's also a parable about bigotry, propaganda, the rise of authoritarian regimes and the need, everywhere and always, for compassion. 'Watership Down'Starts streaming: Dec. 25, on Netflix. If the 1978 animated adaptation of Richard Adams's novel left you with emotional scars as a child, be assured that this limited series is a gentler viewing. Which isn't to say there's no danger or pain involved as a group of refugee rabbits set out in search of a new home when one of their own, the nervous Fiver (voiced by Nicholas Hoult), has visions of ""something bad"" coming. Something bad is always coming for rabbits, of course — they are preyed-upon creatures, after all — but the destruction of their natural world forces them to confront their concept of mortality and to reassess established power structures, as well as the price they are willing to pay for peace. It's easy to love these little guys and girls (there are more female rabbits this time around) and as we spend more time with Fiver, his brother Hazel (voiced by James McAvoy) and their pal Bigwig (John Boyega), we become invested in their fates. Prepare yourself for the usual ""Watership"" waterworks. 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' Starts streaming: Dec. 27, on Hulu. Audrey Hepburn's Holly Golightly is vividly remembered for her sleek dawn-of-the-sixties styles — the little black dress, the big sunglasses, the jaunty cigarette holder. In Blake Edwards's celebrated movie version of Truman Capote's novella, she still casts a spell, and not just over the men passing through her breezy New York life — has the city ever seemed more emblematic? — but over us, too. (Just skip over Mickey Rooney's offensive caricature of a Japanese landlord — Edwards should have.) Also Arriving This Month: New to Amazon Prime Video: ""A Clockwork Orange"" (Dec. 1), ""A Fish Called Wanda"" (Dec. 1), ""All the President's Men"" (Dec. 1), ""The Black Stallion"" (Dec. 1), ""Boogie Nights"" (Dec. 1), ""The Dark Crystal"" (Dec. 1), ""The Firm"" (Dec. 1), ""The Game"" (Dec. 1), ""Mars Attacks!""

0,2018-12-02," Heading into last year's holidays, marketers at HBO were eagerly experimenting with how to use technology like augmented reality and virtual reality to promote their shows. But then, celebrating with their families across the country, they watched as everyone from children to elderly aunts unwrapped smart speakers from Google and Amazon and started barking orders. When they got back to work, the marketers had a new priority: Figure out how HBO, whose product lives on screens, could create a space for itself in the world of voice. ""We saw, partly because Amazon discounted the devices so deeply, that they exploded,"" said Sabrina Caluori, HBO's senior vice president of digital and social marketing. ""Very quickly, we realized that we really needed to dig in."" Google Home and Amazon Echo speakers do not run paid advertising, so brands have approached the devices in two ways. Some are trying to crack the code on search results and make sure that their products are mentioned first when users say they want to buy a specific item. Others are creating games that entertain people or tools that provide some sort of service (like directions for how to get a wine stain out of clothes) in order to build loyalty or name recognition. The devices are still largely used for simple tasks, like checking the weather or listening to the news. But marketers want to be ready for the future, particularly as the voice assistants that power speakers are built into products like appliances and TVs. HBO has created applications — known as ""skills"" on the Amazon Echo devices — to promote its shows and characters. This year, it introduced Westworld: The Maze, a choose-your-own-adventure-style game for superfans of ""Westworld."" (A dramatic trailer for the game ends with a narrator intoning, ""Alexa — open Westworld."") More recently, it introduced a skill starring characters from its new show from Sesame Workshop, ""Esme & Roy,"" in which children can use the speaker to answer questions and play along. Both games can be played without the aid of screens. Unilever has created a recipes skill under its Hellmann's label, while Procter & Gamble has introduced features from Tide and Oral-B. Those using the Tide application can ask Alexa how to remove juice or grass stains from clothing, while Oral-B's offers a tooth-brushing timer. On Google Home, where the term ""skills"" is replaced by ""actions,"" Estée Lauder has one for personalized beauty advice and Disney has some games for children. Marketers have been rushing to figure out where their brands fit in a world populated by voice assistants and smart speakers. While questions remain about  privacy and security, data from Comscore in October showed that more than 20 million homes in the United States, or 22 percent of those with Wi-Fi, use the devices. By 2022, more than half of American homes will have a smart speaker, according to Juniper Research. ""We've hit the point where the majority of our clients are now asking us for help with a voice strategy,"" said Abbey Klaassen, president in New York of the agency 360i, which works with HBO. ""It's gone from an interesting kind of experiment to something they have recognized that they need to invest in to make sure they are discoverable and relevant in the next five years."" Amazon said on a recent earnings call that it had no plans to add paid advertising to Alexa. Google promoted the live-action movie ""Beauty and the Beast"" on Google Home last year. But the company claimed to The Verge that that was a part of its ""My Day"" feature in which it summarizes the events of the coming day and not an ad, and that the devices did not run paid ads. A spokesman declined to comment on whether ads might be sold on the devices in the future. But both Amazon and Google have been willing to work with ad agencies and marketers to help them develop applications for smart speakers. ""They have a vested interest in making sure brands are creating quality voice experiences and not a lot that will drive people crazy,"" Ms. Klaassen said. Often, this form of marketing isn't an effort to sell items directly. Penguin Random House recently made a skill featuring the astronaut Tim Peake, who co-wrote a new book, ""The Astronaut Selection Test Book."" The feature is narrated by Mr. Peake and includes puzzles from the European Space Agency. The publisher also recently unveiled a skill that delivers inspirational quotes from titles by authors like Mindy Kaling and Elizabeth Gilbert. ""We're used to thinking about the elements of the book that we make available for people to sample to get a sense of it,"" said Rebecca Ikin, a marketing director at Cornerstone, a division of the publisher. ""This is taking that principle and applying it to smart speakers."" Like HBO, Ms. Ikin said her team had explored the idea after seeing the boom in interest in the devices last holiday season. Ms. Caluori of HBO said creating the applications could be complex and time intensive, noting that more than 100 people worked on the ""Westworld"" skill, which was made for a niche audience. But she said less help from outside partners was likely to be needed in the future as the work became an ""ongoing evergreen capability."" ""We feel like this voice-based interaction is not going away,"" Ms. Caluori said. ""It's starting with speakers, but it'll very quickly be TVs and cars and all these other places."" The ""Esme & Roy"" skill, which was created with Sesame Workshop, showed the potential for smart speakers with children and their parents. Amazon has been seeking child-friendly voice applications, particularly now that it sells an Echo device meant for children, Ms. Caluori said. At the same time, she said, young parents such as herself are keen on smart speakers, partly because they're a screen-free alternative to tablets and phones. Once the game is opened, children can use the speaker to play along with show's two main characters. They can answer questions to ""travel"" to places like space or underwater, and can jump around while listening to its cues. HBO and Sesame Workshop also wanted to offer something useful for parents, so they included a song from the show that encourages children to calm down while watching (or imagining) glitter settle to the bottom of a jar. ""This experience stands alone, even if you don't know the show,"" Ms. Caluori said. ""If you're looking for kid-friendly skills in your home, it may be a way to introduce your children to the characters, and that then helps you potentially try out the show."" Danielle Reubenstein, executive creative director in the mobile division of the ad agency Possible, said she had been urging brands to view smart speakers as a way to connect with people rather than as a means to sell products — at least for now. ""It's not a super-duper e-commerce platform,"" she said. ""It's about having your customers interact with you in a way that's going to make them more loyal to your product."" Marketers say the data they are getting back from Amazon and Google has been relatively thin so far. It can include the amount of time people spent engaging with a skill and the number of sessions that were started and completed, Ms. Klaassen of 360i said. Ms. Reubenstein said her firm typically got basic data on which questions to Alexa were completed or not. But once, in a meeting with Amazon, the firm briefly got a deeper look, seeing snippets of queries for one client's Alexa skill that showed how customers can still be easily frustrated when navigating a voice application. ""We started seeing a lot of cuss words in the user flow,"" said Ms. Reubenstein, who declined to name the client. She said they were able to identify at what point most users were getting frustrated and adjusted the skill to address the issue. These are still early days for marketing on voice devices. Ms. Reubenstein compared it to when brands began making apps for mobile devices. But over time, she said, voice interactions will begin to replace many of the activities that people are conducting on screens. ""All of it is really a down payment on being able to use those technologies in the future,"" she said."
0,2018-12-03," The high-class problem for a series that had an impressive first season is how to keep that momentum into the second. This is one problem that Amazon's ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" — the first streaming series to win the best comedy Emmy — does not have. This show is nothing but momentum. It jabbers, it twirls, its heels click across the room. It would love to stay and chat but it's gotta get somewhere. The show's delightful, exhausting spirit is turbocharged by the dialogue of the creator, Amy Sherman-Palladino, and embodied by its protagonist, Midge (Rachel Brosnahan), an uptown Manhattan housewife who launches a secret career as a comedian after her marriage falls apart. Brosnahan, infectiously brassy and confident, takes the scripts' energy, torques it, and sends it careening like a top. But also like a top, the first half of the new season, arriving in full Wednesday, covers a lot of ground while spinning back, narratively, to where it's already been. The first season ended with Midge giving a triumphant, confessional standup set at a downtown club. Season 2 kicks off, however, by pausing her career trajectory and jetting off to Paris. There's a plot reason: Midge and her anxious father, Abe (Tony Shalhoub), are chasing after Midge's mother, Rose (Marin Hinkle). But also, come on: It's Paris! ""Maisel"" gives the city the vivid ""Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" treatment, much as the show made over Manhattan as a kind of department-store-window fantasy of itself. A few episodes later, the action relocates to the Catskills resort where Midge's family summers. (Like you're going to make a show about a Jewish comic in the '50s and not go to the Catskills.) Here, the borscht belt is the picture of glamour, the service balletic, the guests greeted with scarlet glasses of tomato juice, each with a perfectly angled celery stalk. The art direction reflects the show's sensibility. The series's personal conflicts are well-grounded, but the details — the upscale Jewish New York milieu, the fashions, the repartee — are idealized. (As is parenthood; single mom Midge benefits from a wealth of convenient child care.) ""Mrs. Maisel"" takes place less in the 1950s than in a 2018 idea of a 1950s movie's idea of the 1950s. Fortunately, ""Mrs. Maisel"" details its characters as precisely as its scenery. Alex Borstein owns the screen as Midge's wrecking-ball manager, Susie; Shalhoub finds both comedy and depth in the scatterbrained academic Abe. Midge's ex, Joel (Michael Zegen), becomes more interesting as he tries to build a life without Midge, while Zachary Levi (""Chuck""), as a new love interest, adapts to the show's conversational pace as if nimbly leaping on a moving train. Scene by scene, the new season is a stunner. If you can enjoy it in the moment — and roll with the occasional linguistic anachronism — this season is a welcome mid-Hanukkah present. But Midge's larger arc often seems stalled. The season repeats many of the conflicts of the first — just how over Midge's marriage really is, just how willing she is to change her comfortable life. There is a lot of movement here, but not necessarily a lot of progress. There is still comedy; as in Season 1, most episodes manage to get Midge on stage for a standup set. (In Paris, that takes place in a drag club, with a French patron providing machine-gun translation.) But even as she fights to get placed in the prestigious, male-dominated Midtown comedy clubs, you get the sense that this is still half a hobby for her; she seems more concerned about getting back on the makeup counter at her department-store day job. It's not clear how much of this is Midge not being committed to a future as a comedian — which would mean coming clean to her family and maybe losing that art-directed good life — and how much is the series itself not knowing how to move on with her story, because it enjoys the status quo (a common second-season issue). This in turn makes it hard to know just what the stakes are: How badly does Midge need to be a comic? Some of the season's best early scenes come when Susie presses this point with her whirligig client. When Midge announces that she's vacationing in the Catskills for two months, missing a summer's worth of gigs, Susie is aghast. For Susie, the comedy biz isn't a lark; it's the difference between paying the bills and being on the street, and the contrast between her and her privileged client is the splash of cold water this show sometimes needs. When Midge describes a day at her summer resort, Susie asks, ""What are you, the lost Gabor sister?"" Amazon showed critics five episodes out of 10, and by the season's midpoint, it seems as if Midge may be at a juncture where she has to decide how serious she is. In the fifth episode, she sits down with her friend and consigliere, Lenny Bruce (Luke Kirby), who asks her, ""Do you really think you can go back to making Jell-O molds again?"" God, let's hope not. Though I'm sure the Jell-O molds would look fantastic."
0,2018-12-04," WASHINGTON — President Trump spent much of last spring accusing Amazon of pulling a ""scam"" on the American taxpayer and ripping off the United States Postal Service. On Tuesday, his administration delivered its own verdict: Not so much. The task force created by Mr. Trump to investigate the Postal Service's finances did conclude that the mail system is losing money. But a report issued on Tuesday said that commercial package delivery for Amazon and other e-commerce retailers was actually profitable for the Postal Service and was not costing the United States ""massive amounts of money,"" as Mr. Trump has suggested in his tweets. Commercial package delivery is not profitable enough to offset the revenue losses the Postal Service is suffering, however, as Americans mail fewer and fewer first-class letters, and the Treasury Department task force outlined several recommendations to help shore up its finances. None of the suggestions explicitly recommend the type of price increases that Mr. Trump floated last spring, when he posted a tweet accusing Amazon of using the Postal Service ""as their Delivery Boy."" And last December he tweeted that Amazon was getting ""richer"" while making the postal system ""dumber."" ""Should be charging MUCH MORE!"" he wrote. But the report did include some recommendations that made online retailers uneasy. One would push the Postal Service to price package delivery to maximize profits, instead of maximizing delivery volume. Another would force the service to create separate accounting books for letters and for packages, which retailers fear could lead to an increase in package rates. Its top recommendations were to improve postal system governing to create a more stringent definition of which deliveries and which customers the Postal Service must include under its legal — but vaguely defined — ""universal service obligation."" It also called for steps to reduce the service's labor costs, including eliminating collective bargaining over pay for postal employees. And it recommended lifting caps on how much the service can charge for letter delivery and giving it power to reduce the number of days it delivers mail — which most likely would mean ending letter delivery on Saturdays. The task force also proposed creating a complicated new system of pricing for packages, in which it could cost less to send a box of prescription drugs than to send a board game. It would also allow the postal system to charge other delivery services for access to Americans' mailboxes; under current law, the Postal Service holds a monopoly on what can actually be delivered to a mailbox. Amazon and many other retailers formed an advocacy group on postal issues this year, called the Package Coalition. Its chairman, the former Army secretary John M. McHugh, said on Tuesday that the coalition was ""concerned that some of the task force recommendations, including the recommendation to create a separate package business, would needlessly reduce efficiency and force the Postal Service to raise prices on American businesses and consumers."" The report was nonbinding. Many of its recommendations will fall into the storm drain of a divided Congress, with Democrats set to take control of the House in January. It was unclear why the administration chose to release the report on Tuesday, when the news cycle was dominated by trade tensions with China and funeral proceedings in Washington for former President George Bush. Administration officials played down the report's links to Mr. Trump's frequent Twitter complaints about Amazon. ""None of our findings relate to any one customer of the Postal Service,"" a senior administration official said on Tuesday afternoon, in a briefing call with reporters. ""We based our analysis on the needs of all our economy."" Instead, they cast the report as a needed set of reforms for a service that has been losing money for a decade, and is projected to lose tens of billions over the next decade. ""We believe these are the first steps forward,"" Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, wrote to Mr. Trump at the beginning of the report, ""in creating a sustainable business model under which the U.S.P.S. can continue to provide necessary mail services for all Americans."""
0,2018-12-07," Visiting the Chocolate Factory Theater, in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, feels like witnessing the end of an era these days. Amazon is poised to descend on the area, and the theater itself, a brick-walled room on a quiet block, is preparing to move to a larger  location nearby. The change is bittersweet: Buying a home is a big deal for a small New York arts organization, but the idiosyncrasies of the current (rented) building, where artists have had freedom to experiment since 2005, will be hard to part with. The choreographer Neil Greenberg is among the last to make use of this singular space, turning its architectural quirks and narrow dimensions to his advantage, like many before him. In ""To the Things Themselves!,"" which had its premiere on Wednesday and runs through Dec. 15, he seats audience members along the theater's four sides, so that everyone has a front-row view of the bright and absorbing action, sometimes positioned mere centimeters from the dancers and the objects they carry. Yes, there are tangible things in ""To the Things Themselves!"": microphones, wooden batons, a slender bird statue. The four dedicated performers — Michael Ingle, Kyli Kleven, Omagbitse Omagbemi and, in an opening solo, Mr. Greenberg — swing, toss, nudge and dangle these, undercutting their conventional functions. Yet the ardent title refers as much to things you can't physically grasp — movement, light, sound — and to the possibility of being fully present, as a viewer, in the moment. Mr. Greenberg, who has been making dances for more than three decades, allows us to do just that, creating a world that's difficult to explain but easy to enjoy, a series of moments to get lost in. In his brief solo, Mr. Greenberg establishes the dreamy structure — and the subtly madcap humor — that persists through the work's 75 minutes. Wearing a green track suit (Paige Martin and Parker Lutz designed the fashionably sporty costumes) and wielding a wooden pole, he could be part of a baseball team or a marching band, yet these associations linger for just seconds before transforming. Michael Stiller's pliant lighting and James Lo's playful soundscape — sampling from Prokofiev, Ruth Draper monologues and the soundtrack to ""La Dolce Vita,"" among other sources — also shift abruptly, as if sweeping us through portals, between dimensions. It's the three other dancers who commune most intimately with the theater, getting close to its architecture as they hold microphones to its worn walls (so much history in there), recline against its radiators and make a racket banging on the floor. Mr. Greenberg credits them with generating the movement, through improvisations recorded on video, then copied verbatim; that process comes through in their comfort with the material and the pleasure it appears to bring them. When Ms. Kleven crosses the stage with quizzical, stuttering steps, or Mr. Ingle balances in a low arabesque, or Ms. Omagbemi sits in a split and, smiling, slaps the ground, each seems to be slipping into something custom-made, for their bodies and the space."

0,2018-12-08," Sharing an Amazon Prime account with loved ones is surprisingly intimate. You're privy to one another's impulse buys, fondness for corny '90s comedies and preferred brands of vaginal suppositories. Like many families, mine shares a login for the ubiquitous delivery behemoth. Every time my dad or my sister orders an item, I see a cheerful red badge pop up on my app: ""Your Amazon.com shipment is on its way!"" Lately, those red badges have started coming several times a week. In 2018 alone, my family has spent nearly $7,000 on Amazon. It's not that we have extra time and money to shop; we have precisely the opposite. A few years ago, my 85-year-old father had a stroke that forever altered his daily life. Even though he has a generous, old-economy pension, he now barely breaks even each month, thanks to six figures of annual medical expenses, including 24-hour care at home. Often, when my dad needs something, he needs it now. He can't shop on his own, and his caretaker can't spend her life going to specialty pharmacies and medical supply stores. So Amazon Prime has been his lifeline. My dad, a former professor with an impressive library, used to buy only books on the site. Now nearly everything he needs comes from Amazon: physical therapy balls, elevated toilet seats, a better wheelchair than Medicare can cover, cheap tubs of protein powder, even staples like kitty litter and T-shirts. In a simpler world, Amazon Prime might be an uncomplicated bright spot amid America's vastly inadequate health care and elder care system. But in the past few years, the constant stream of negative reports about the company — poor working conditions in its warehouses, its ruthless white-collar work culture, what my dad called the ""corporate bribery"" resulting in two new headquarters — makes it feel like a deal with the devil. Before my dad joined academia, he was a factory worker and a union organizer for nearly two decades; he sang ""Solidarity Forever"" to me as a lullaby. Each one-click purchase feels like a teensy betrayal of my dad's past, a cruel reminder that he's now reliant on a monopolistic corporation with an atrocious labor record. (That record isn't resolved by its recent $15-an-hour minimum wage announcement). My sister Kim faces this irony, too. Last year, just before her 60th birthday, she found out she had breast cancer. The chemo wreaked havoc on her immune system, and she took a seven-month leave from work. Afraid of making her health worse during a historic flu season, she barely left the house and started ordering the most prosaic products on Amazon Prime in bulk: tissues, a fleece jacket, a lemon squeezer, dinner forks, deodorant. As her cancer treatment ramped up, the red badges signaled other items: wig caps, pill organizer, the Book of Common Prayer, a St. Peregrine patron saint of cancer medal. When her chemo resulted in a raging case of hemorrhoids, she was grateful not to have to ask our brother, who was caring for her, to fetch her sitz bath salts and witch hazel pads. After her reduced disability pay began to catch up with her, she used Amazon for the discounts. She once ordered 27 rolls of toilet paper for just $16.97. My sister spends her days as a social worker in hospice, giving her a front-row seat to the travesty of end-of-life care in the United States. A bleeding-heart liberal, she'd been known for fierce Facebook posts on things like President Trump and gay marriage. When she was going through treatment, her heart was bled dry. ""When I was in survival mode, I couldn't think of anything else but feeling better,"" Kim told me. ""I really wasn't thinking globally."" I wondered how many other people were also in this kind of survival mode: perhaps the one in seven American adults with a disability affecting their mobility, or the 60 percent who have a chronic condition, or the three-quarters of workers who live paycheck to paycheck, or the more than 90,000 who work in Amazon's ""fulfillment centers"" in the United States because they have no better options. If I wanted to quit the service forever because it offends my values, I could probably do that without upending my life. But even for someone like me, who isn't sick or disabled or poor or living in a rural area, Amazon Prime helps alleviate the pressures of a sped-up economy. I don't use it just because I'm lazy and love to stream ""Transparent."" I use it (and other timesaving apps like Seamless and Uber) because I'm overworked and one-click ordering spares me time.  I also live in a city where the cost of living is skyrocketing, so I might as well save money where I can. You have to be an able-bodied person with remarkable affluence and free time to not buy any of your food from drive-through windows, to forgo Walgreens for an independent pharmacy, to avoid all-encompassing superstores that slash prices. Nearly two-thirds of Americans have bought something on Amazon, and 95 percent have shopped at Walmart. ""We should nationalize Amazon,"" my dad says whenever I bemoan all this. His suggestion is a perennial leftist refrain; Sarah Jaffe paraphrased Kanye West nicely in The Outline, when she wrote, ""No one company should have all that power."" But you don't have to be a socialist to feel for the workers hurt by big companies. A recent Gallup poll showed that 62 percent of Americans approve of unions, and Pew found that 58 percent say there should be limits on the number of jobs that can be replaced with machines (a practice common in Amazon's warehouses and, increasingly, for its desk jobs). Some of those people overlap with the patrons of huge corporations. Yet, as Kim observed, it's hard to care about the big picture when you're simply putting one foot in front of the other. Because of seemingly remote forces — an inaccessible elder care system, insufficient health coverage, stagnant wages, long work hours — those of us who see corporate monopolies as detrimental to this country nevertheless rely on them for anything from dish soap to our paychecks. The Libertarian presidential candidate Harry Browne famously warned that the government will break your legs, then hand you crutches. Mr. Browne, an ardent fan of the free market, could have been describing the economy of cheap convenience. Amazon is the clearest example of a corporation exploiting the precariousness created by capitalism — precisely by soothing some of its pain."
0,2018-12-10," Amazon, the world's largest online retailer and largest cloud-computing company, is pushing into a new line of work: computer chips. Late last month, the company, based in Seattle, revealed that it had spent the last few years building a new chip for use inside the millions of servers in its data centers around the world. Amazon does not plan to sell this chip directly to customers, but the decision by one of the world's biggest buyers of computer processors to go the do-it-yourself route is likely to have a major impact on Intel, the iconic Silicon Valley chip maker. Intel has struggled to keep up with recent technology trends, from the increasing use of mobile devices to artificial intelligence, as influence over chip designs has been shifting to Amazon, Apple and Google, which already dominate much of the rest of the tech industry. Amazon's new chip arrives as market forces are rapidly undercutting chip makers and their $412 billion in yearly sales. Online operations like Amazon and Google have grown so large, they can save significant money by making chips tailored to their needs rather than buying them from longtime suppliers. The homegrown chip also gives Amazon bargaining power with Intel, which hasn't had much competition in the server market in recent years. The internet company will still buy from Intel because it would be difficult to build all the chips it needed on its own. But now it will have options. Intel acknowledges that companies like Amazon want to reduce their dependency on one big chip supplier. ""I am not unaware of the dynamic,"" Lisa Spelman, an Intel vice president, said. ""Our goal is to understand and respectfully acknowledge that desire."" About 35 percent of the server chips sold around the world go to about 10 companies, including large internet companies like Amazon and a handful of telecommunication firms, said Shane Rau, a chip analyst with the research firm IDC. That just one of them is shifting its business is terrible news for Intel. ""Each one of these companies is so large, they represent a market unto themselves,"" Mr. Rau said. In recent years, Google has designed specialized chips for artificial intelligence technology. Facebook and Microsoft, which like most internet companies are major buyers of chips from Intel, have indicated that they are working on similar A.I. chips. Apple beat the other tech giants to this cost-saving trend four years ago when it unveiled its first custom-built chip for the iPhone. Google and Microsoft are also building the chips that go into devices like smartphones and virtual-reality headsets. Amazon has upped the ante. In 2015, it spent a reported $350 million to acquire a chip maker, Annapurna Labs, which helped build the new central processing unit, or C.P.U. A C.P.U. — the centerpiece of a computer's operations — is the sort of chip that Intel has made for decades to run personal computers and servers. Building these chips requires rare expertise and hundreds of millions of dollars in capital. It is a big step up in complexity from building chips tailored to certain tasks. ""The belief was that you needed some magic to build a processor, particularly a server processor,"" said Andrew Feldman, the chief executive of the chip start-up Cerebras and a former executive at the chip maker AMD. ""You had to be Intel or AMD — and that was about it."" Amazon executives believe the chip, which was designed to be more energy efficient, will help reduce the cost of electrical power in its data centers. It said it was offering a cloud-computing service that would allow business customers to use its new chip. The cost of the service could be 45 percent lower than other options. And when Amazon buys chips from other companies, a homegrown option gives it even more sway over prices. ""They can now say to Intel, 'We will just move the workloads to other chips,'"" Mr. Feldman said. Amazon has also designed a chip for artificial intelligence, called the Inferentia. In a recent blog post, James Hamilton, vice president and distinguished engineer inside Amazon's cloud computing arm, said the company would continue building new chips for artificial intelligence and other specialized tasks. Google has designed three generations of A.I. chips, and it has long hinted that it will eventually build a C.P.U. ""That's not rocket science,"" a Google chip specialist, Dave Patterson, said late last year. Though it is still enormously difficult, building a chip is easier than it used to be. Amazon licensed much of the technology from ARM, the company that provides the basic technology for most smartphone chips. It made the chip through TSMC, a Taiwanese company. For Intel, Amazon's move into C.P.U.s is a strike at a longtime strength. Intel was beaten to the smartphone and tablet market a decade ago, a significant missed opportunity. The tech industry shifted, and Intel didn't shift with it. But Intel has a 96.6 percent share of server chip sales, according to IDC. It was 98.6 percent until its longtime competitor, AMD, which had stayed on the sidelines of the server business for about a decade, recently re-entered the market. Intel's profits continue to rise with the rapid expansion of the tech industry. But the financial results of its most recent quarter highlight the chip maker's dependence on servers. Intel's data center group, which sells both server and A.I. chips, pulled in $6.1 billion, a 26 percent increase over the previous year. The group now accounts for more than 30 percent of Intel's revenue. As the chip market has changed, Intel has tried to diversify. In recent years, it bought three companies that design chips for artificial intelligence and other types of hardware that are becoming increasingly important inside smartphones, cars and data centers. The competition outside of traditional server chips is extensive. In addition to Amazon, Google and Nvidia — the dominant maker of specialty chips for tasks like A.I. — dozens of smaller companies are building A.I. chips. Through their fast-growing cloud computing services, Amazon, Microsoft, Alibaba and Google are reinventing how companies set up their computer networks. Going to a cloud service allows companies to wash their hands of acquiring and maintaining back-room computer systems — the tech experts do it for them. It is a lucrative business. Amazon Web Services brings in nearly $27 billion a year, and it accounts for 56 percent of Amazon's profits. Inside these cloud operations, the internet companies are also reinventing how computers are built. They are designing much of their own hardware, from the servers to the networking gear that connects servers. Facebook is doing similar work with the technology in its data centers. Amazon's new chip is running only a small fraction of the software across the company's online empire. But that is expected to expand. ""We will look back at this as a watershed moment,"" said Mr. Feldman, the chief executive of Cerebras."
1,2018-12-10," SÃO PAULO, Brazil — Fueled by the surging price of gold, an epidemic of illegal gold mining in the Amazon is threatening indigenous territories and other protected lands in the world's largest tropical rain forest, according to a study published by a group of environmental organizations this week. Analyzing data from six Amazon countries, researchers identified 2,312 illegal mining sites and 245 large-scale areas where miners have established sophisticated infrastructure, tearing down native forests and contaminating rivers with mercury as they dredge for gold and extract diamonds and coltan, which are used to make mobile phones. ""The problem is worse than at any other time in history,"" said Alicia Rolla, one of the coordinators at the Amazon Geo-Referenced Socio-Environmental Information Network, known as RAISG, which published the study this week. ""We wanted to give visibility to the enormity of an issue that doesn't respect borders."" The  report compiled data from local partners, news reports and research from eight independent environmental groups that scanned satellite images, mapping mining sites in Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela. Each site on the map contains details about the material being mined and the mines' environmental and social impacts, such as how dredging disrupts rivers and how toxic pollutants seep into plants, animals and people. Venezuela had more illegal mines than any other country studied, followed by Brazil and Ecuador, according to the report. The researchers hope to pressure governments to work together to combat the international criminal activity. ""When Brazilian authorities go after the miners, they flee to Venezuela and vice versa,"" Ms. Rolla said. ""There needs to be intergovernmental cooperation."" However, she said, Brazil's recent election of Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right former army captain who has vowed to end the ""industry"" of fines imposed on companies that violate environmental laws, and halt the demarcation of indigenous lands, could represent a serious setback. ""If he does all the things he said he would do, things could get worse, not better,"" she said. ""When we started working on this project more than a year ago we didn't imagine such a tragedy."" Mr. Bolsonaro has made it clear he favors allowing more commercial activity in the Amazon, and wants to slash the budgets of government agencies that monitor and punish illegal activity there. ""Where there is indigenous land,"" he said last year, ""there is wealth underneath it."" Although Mr. Bolsonaro has stepped back from threats to eliminate Brazil's Environment Ministry and pull out of the Paris climate agreement, Brazil withdrew from hosting next year's United Nations global summit on climate change after his election. For environment minister, Mr. Bolsonaro has chosen Ricardo de Aquino Salles, a lawyer who was accused by a public prosecutor of illegally altering environmental impact maps while he was the environmental secretary for the state of São Paulo. Experts say illegal logging and land invasions in the Brazilian Amazon rose as Mr. Bolsonaro gained traction ahead of his election in October. Between August 2017 and July 2018, deforestation rose 13.7 percent, the highest increase in a decade, according to Brazil's Environment Ministry. ""It was crazy,"" said Fany Ricardo, an anthropologist at Brazil's SocioEnvironmental Institute, one of the groups involved in the research. ""During the campaign deforestation rates just kept climbing and climbing, even in indigenous lands where it is strictly forbidden. Now there is still monitoring. Afterwards it's going to be worse,"" she added, referring to the administration of Mr. Bolsonaro, who takes office on Jan. 1. The map published by RAISG shows illegal mining sites in 37 indigenous territories — 18 of them in Brazil — and near or surrounding another 78 indigenous territories. ""There are very serious consequences,"" Ms. Ricardo said. ""Beyond the pollution, miners are getting close to uncontacted tribes, which could pose a mortal threat in terms of illness and conflict."" Mining is illegal inside indigenous territories, but in some cases tribes agree to look the other way in exchange for payment. RAISG members had hoped that exposing the extent of illegal activity would spur a crackdown and encourage governments to support alternative, sustainable forms of income, such as gathering and selling exotic fruits to high-end buyers. ""With our new president-elect, I don't know what will happen,"" Ms. Ricardo said. In the report, the researchers also published case studies, for instance on the devastating toll that mercury, used in gold mining, has had on indigenous tribes and remote fishing communities. The research highlighted a study of hair samples in territory of the Yanomami, an indigenous group whose land straddles Brazil and Venezuela. In the Aracaçá community there, where illegal mining is rampant, 92 percent of the hair samples showed high levels of mercury contamination. The map also shows that illegal mining often overlaps with legal mining, and researchers plan to update it as more information becomes available. Ms. Rolla, the RAISG coordinator, stressed that the mining has deep societal consequences that need further documenting. ""The problem isn't just deforestation and pollution, there is a serious social element that includes disease, prostitution and displacement,"" Ms. Rolla said. ""What we need is more monitoring, not less,"" she said. ""And I fear the opposite is going to happen."""
2,2018-12-10," [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] Amazon says its new headquarters in Long Island City, Queens, will bring 25,000 jobs. It will also bring more crowds, more noise and, yes, more toilet flushing. It might seem mundane, but what happens in the bathroom matters: New York, for all its modern conveniences, sits atop a century-old sewage system used by more people than ever before. Every time someone flushes, washes their hands or takes a shower, all that household wastewater (and worse) flows down into 7,500 miles of sewer pipes. Most of these pipes also do double duty, collecting rainwater runoff from rooftops as well as streets. When these sewer pipes get clogged by humans — flushing baby wipes anyone? — or simply overloaded with rainwater, it becomes everyone's problem. The ""combined sewer overflows"" are discharged directly into nearby rivers, bays and creeks instead of going to wastewater treatment plants. Raw sewage also backs up in homes, creating a stomach-turning mess. Long Island City residents say these backups and overflows already happen whenever it rains hard — and 25,000 more Amazon workers will only make the problem worse. But city officials say they are ready to take on whatever comes down the pipes. Here is why. A New Yorker typically uses 100 gallons of water per day, from showering and brushing teeth to washing dishes and clothes, according to the city. All that water goes into the sewer pipes. By that math, 25,000 Amazon workers will produce 2.5 million gallons of wastewater per day. While that sounds like a lot, it is actually not by city standards. For context, about 1.3 billion gallons of wastewater pass daily through the entire sewage system on rainless days. Even when it rains, the system can handle up to 3.8 billion gallons of wastewater per day. Amazon's wastewater will flow into pipes that are bigger than those found in most residential neighborhoods. Long Island City is a former industrial area, so its pipes once handled the output from factories and businesses. These sewer pipes are also in relatively good shape, said Vincent Sapienza, commissioner of the city's Department of Environmental Protection. The oldest pipes date to the 1900s, while others were added in the 1920s when construction was planned for the entrance to the Queens-Midtown Tunnel. The rest came decades later. Citywide, the average age of a sewer line is about 80 years old. ""I would say Long Island City is middle-aged,"" Mr. Sapienza said. Nearly all of Long Island City's wastewater is whisked away to the Bowery Bay Wastewater Treatment Plant in Astoria, Queens, one of the city's 14 sewage treatment plants. Currently, the Bowery Bay plant processes about 100 million gallons of wastewater each day. It can handle much more — up to 150 million gallons a day — leaving plenty of room for Amazon's wastewater, city officials said. ""Even if there's an influx of 25,000 people, that's only 2.5 million gallons more a day,"" Mr. Sapienza said. ""It's not much. In the scheme of things, it's not a big difference."" Heavy rains, however, can upend the city's sewage calculations. In Long Island City, as in many other neighborhoods, sewer lines can fill up with so much rainwater runoff that there are combined sewer overflows. Citywide, about 20 billion gallons of combined sewer overflows are discharged annually into local waterways. Still, that is an improvement from nearly 110 billion gallons annually in 1985. The overflows can trigger beach closings and restrictions on recreational water use. ""That's the No. 1 water pollution problem in New York City,"" said Eric A. Goldstein, a senior lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group. ""It happens every time it rains — whether Amazon gets built or not."" But Amazon — or any large development — could exacerbate that existing wet weather pollution problem, Mr. Goldstein added. A 2012 city rule requires new developments to take measures to retain significant amounts of rainwater on site, such as using green roofs and porous pavements. As a result, city officials said, Amazon's new headquarters would be an improvement over older buildings — and could actually end up reducing rainwater runoff in the sewage system. City officials pointed to significant progress in reducing rainwater runoff — and the resulting overflows — across the city in recent decades. In fact, they like to say that New York waters have not been this clean since the Civil War. Mr. Sapienza said his agency will be monitoring Amazon's development to see if additional work is needed. Even before the Amazon deal, the city's Economic Development Corporation announced $95 million for water and sewer improvements in the neighborhood. Officials also pointed to years of city efforts to lay the groundwork for development in the neighborhood, including opening a new section of Hunters Point South Park along the East River in June that serves as a buffer against storm surges. An Amazon official said the company has not yet begun to design its buildings and will address infrastructure needs during the environmental review process. In Seattle, where Amazon is based, its buildings have green roofs and low-flow fixtures in the restrooms, and capture rainwater to use to water the landscape. Still, critics worry these efforts will not be enough, especially given all the other development in Long Island City. They also pointed out that climate change could bring more frequent and more severe storms — and more rainwater runoff. City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, a Democrat who represents Long Island City, said sewer lines were built for fewer people, and have not kept up with the recent building boom. In many buildings, residents are asked not to flush during heavy rains, he said. ""This would turn a situation that is untenable into a crisis if Amazon is able to build all of this and bring in all of these people,"" he said. Mike Dulong, a senior attorney for Riverkeeper, an environmental group, said Amazon's headquarters could undermine years of efforts to clean up local waters. ""That's a lot of people,"" Mr. Dulong said. ""That's a lot of toilets and showers and sinks and wastewater going into treatment plants that are already overwhelmed every time there's a significant amount of rain."" Tom Paino, an architect and longtime resident, said that sewage problems have become a constant headache and ""$95 million is not enough to even begin to cover what needs to be done."" No matter how big the sewer pipes are, he said, ""They are not big enough."" As it is, sewage backs up in homes and businesses. Combined sewer overflows wash up along the waterfront and in parks where children play, residents said, and with rising sea levels could creep farther inland in coming years. ""It's a health hazard,"" said Ernie Brooks,"" a musician who lives near the Amazon site, who also complained of an odor from the overflows. ""If you walk around Long Island City after a heavy rain, there's a lot of standing water — often at least a foot near where I live."" Sheila Lewandowski, the executive director of a nonprofit theater, lives a block away from the East River. Whenever a deluge is possible, she scrambles around her basement getting everything off the floor — even propping chairs and tables on top of paint cans — in case the river rises high enough to flood her home. ""I don't want to be cleaning the sewage off my furniture,"" she said. ""If we don't deal with the problems that currently exist in the sewage system, every new building exacerbates each of those problems."""
0,2018-12-11," Lothar Baumgarten, a conceptual artist who used photography, film, prints, storytelling, soundscapes and more to explore a wide range of subjects, most notably the collision of cultures threatening people like the Yanomami in the South American rain forest, died on Dec. 3 in Berlin. He was 74. The Marian Goodman Gallery in New York, which represented him, announced his death without specifying a cause. ""The breadth of his work was really enormous,"" Ms. Goodman said in a telephone interview. In the late 1970s, Mr. Baumgarten spent months at a time on repeated occasions living with the Yanomami in a remote region on the border of Venezuela and Brazil, immersing himself in their way of life. His experiences formed the basis of numerous exhibitions for decades afterward, including, in 1993, ""America: Invention,"" in which he transformed the famed spiral at the Guggenheim Museum into a study of threatened and lost cultures. On the floor he emblazoned the words ""Borrowed Land for Sale,"" and up the spiral he displayed the names of North and South American tribes, some familiar, others a fading memory. The piece also incorporated adjectives associated with ethnographic displays of such peoples, like ""lost"" and ""subtitled."" The work, Roberta Smith wrote in a review in The New York Times, created ""a kind of linguistic monument"" to those tribes, with Mr. Baumgarten ""transforming the spiral's space into something akin to a giant word-map or an inside-out globe."" But though he used the tools of ethnography, he did not view himself as merely documenting. As an artist, his journey did not really begin until he got home. ""That's when I really saw,"" he told The Times in 1988, when another installation based on his time with the Yanomami, ""Terra Incognita,"" was on display at the Goodman gallery, which showed his work for decades. ""You cannot reflect your own society unless you know a society that is remote from it,"" he added. ""To know that society, you don't want to walk into it, get a Ph.D. and turn the page. You have to jump into the bushes, almost naked, as I did."" Lothar Baumgarten was born on Oct. 5, 1944, in Rheinsberg, Germany. His father Kurt, was an anthropologist, and his mother, Johanna, was an executive secretary at a bank. He became interested in photography as a child. ""When I was 5,"" he told Mousse Magazine in 2016, ""I found that I couldn't express myself clearly enough verbally to my father. I said to him, 'I'd like to give you a picture from what I see.' "" So his father gave him an Agfa box camera. He graduated from the State Academy of Fine Arts Karlsruhe in 1968, and from 1969 to 1971 he studied at the Academy of Arts in Düsseldorf, where his teachers included Joseph Beuys. Mr. Baumgarten began making photographic studies of displays at ethnography museums throughout Europe. Then came his stay in the Amazon, which he drew upon for several exhibitions in the 1980s, including one for the 1984 Venice Biennale, in which he embedded the topography of the Amazon River system into the floor of the German Pavilion. In the late 1960s or early '70s, he had a serendipitous encounter that ultimately helped bring him to attention in the United States as well. Ms. Goodman and a colleague were participating in an art fair in Düsseldorf when the colleague became ill, leaving Ms. Goodman, who was then early in her career as a gallerist, with 40 pictures to hang. The colleague called a local gallery and asked the owner whether someone was available to help. ""She sent over a young man, and he did a great job of hanging the work,"" Ms. Goodman said. Only when he mentioned that he had a film showing nearby did she realize that he was an artist, not just a gallery assistant. It was, of course, Mr. Baumgarten, and she was soon presenting him in the United States. His many exhibitions at the gallery included an installation in 1987 that focused on a hunting trip he had gone on while living with the Yanomami. ""What interests him is the space between him and them, between culture and nature, and between our civilization and theirs,"" Michael Brenson wrote of that show in The Times. ""By making an installation that can function as that space, he hopes to encourage a new tolerance and awareness of the ""other.' "" Mr. Baumgarten was known for immersing himself in whatever subject he might tackle. ""He was very demanding of himself, that he did his best and understood the subject,"" Ms. Goodman said. ""He was always in for every project, all the way."" For ""Carbon,"" an installation that examined American railroads and their role in opening up the West and disrupting Native American cultures, he rode the rails for four and a half months in 1989. His commitment of time and attention extended to individual elements of that work as well, like a photograph of cows in a field. ""It took me 20 minutes to establish communication with the cow in the middle,"" Mr. Baumgarten told The Dallas Morning News in 2004 when ""Carbon"" was at the Dallas Museum of Art. In 1999 he married Nobuko Sugai, who survives him, as does a son, Moritz. One of Mr. Baumgarten's more unusual works, presented at Marian Goodman in 2008, was ""Matteawan/Fishkill Creek,"" an 80-minute sound recording made one night at Denning's Point on the Hudson River near Beacon, N.Y. That spit of land was once home to Indians and later the site of a brick works before the State of New York acquired it in 1988; hikers now encounter ruins from its industrial stage. Mr. Baumgarten sought to capture not just the sounds of the night, but the ghosts of the area's past and the possibility of an ominous future. ""It is a variation on this warning — that we ignore the natural and our place within its order at the risk of great peril to ourselves and others,"" Chris Wiley wrote in reviewing the work for Daylight Magazine in 2008. That warning, he added, ""acts as subterranean thread connecting Baumgarten's work, whether he is in the jungles of South America, the manicured parks of Europe, or the tangled woodlands of upstate New York."" ""If we listen closely to the sounds of Denning's Point,"" Mr. Wiley wrote, ""we can hear echoes of the wild noises that will haunt our future ruins, unless we are careful."""

1,2018-12-13," SAN FRANCISCO — This generation's biggest technology companies — including Apple, Amazon and Google — have long been tied to their hometowns. Now these giants are increasingly outgrowing their West Coast roots. Driven by a limited pool of skilled workers and the ballooning cost of living in their home bases of Silicon Valley and Seattle, as well as President Trump's shifting immigration policies, the companies are aggressively taking their talent hunt across the United States and elsewhere. And they are coalescing particularly around a handful of urban areas that are already winners in the new knowledge-based economy, including New York City, Washington, Boston and Austin, Tex. This eastward expansion accelerated on Thursday when Apple said it would build a $1 billion campus in Austin, expanding its presence there to over 11,000 workers and becoming the area's largest private employer. The decision followed Amazon's highly publicized selection of Queens and Arlington, Va., last month for new offices that would house at least 50,000 employees. Google, too, is shopping for more real estate in New York that could enable it to more than double its work force of 7,000 in the city. ""They're expanding out,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ""Tech talent is in very short supply. So if these tech companies want to grow and flourish, they need to find talent in other parts of the country."" The chase for tech talent has been global for decades, and Silicon Valley's older companies have had big offices all over the world for years. Intel, for example, has far more employees in Oregon than it does in California. Hewlett-Packard, which split into two companies three years ago, has had large outposts in Idaho and Oregon. Amazon, Apple and Google are now increasingly adopting the same strategy as they hire for growth and pursue the brightest minds in new technologies, in an effort to outmuscle one another. Over the past two years, Amazon's work force has doubled to 613,300 employees; Google's parent, Alphabet, has increased its head count by 35 percent, to 94,300; and Apple has grown nearly 14 percent, to 132,000 workers. Many of the companies are trying to cozy up to top engineering schools in cities like Pittsburgh, where Google recently opened an office and where Uber has had a center, or Zurich as they search for hard-to-find talent in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies. Cambridge, England, now hosts several A.I. research outposts for American tech companies, including Amazon, Microsoft and Apple. Like Cambridge, England, some cities in the United States have also become known for a particular area of tech expertise, in what has become a modern remake of the country's industrial era, when cities came to specialize in the production of cars, steel and coal. The Seattle area, home to Amazon and Microsoft, is known for experts in cloud-computing services thanks to Amazon's leadership in that field. Pittsburgh is known for A.I. because of Carnegie Mellon University's computer science program. Cambridge, Mass., is associated with robotics, thanks to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. And New York is often where cutting-edge work on financial services technology is done. The search for talent outside Silicon Valley and Seattle has also been prompted by issues in the companies' hometowns, which have not built enough housing to keep up with their growing work forces. San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland and Seattle are the four most expensive major cities in the country based on home values, according to data from Zillow. The median home in San Francisco is valued at almost $1.4 million and more than $733,000 in Seattle. Questions also abound over the quality and funding of the areas' public school systems. ""Every day as a C.E.O., you have employees coming to you saying, 'I don't make enough to buy a house for my family,' and you already feel like you are paying through the nose,"" said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, the real estate site based in Seattle. ""Almost everyone is looking at other affordable places where you can open an office."" Some economists said the Trump administration's tougher immigration policies could also restrict the tech giants from importing skilled workers from abroad to their West Coast headquarters. The Trump administration has increased the red tape in applying for H-1B visas for highly skilled workers and has denied petitions more often. Over a five-day window this April, employers submitted petitions for more than 190,000 specialized work visas, but only 85,000 can be granted annually. That has helped push some tech companies into building major outposts in Canada, particularly in Toronto and Vancouver. Edward Glaeser, a Harvard economics professor, said that even if H-1B workers were to come through in abundance, it would still make sense to put them in cheaper cities, like Austin. He said, ""$100,000 goes a lot further in Austin than in Silicon Valley."" Yet even as the tech companies move beyond the West Coast, their choices to converge on cities or towns that are already highly educated, wealthy and well employed do not spread the wealth. More than 44 percent of all digital-service jobs in the United States were located in just 10 metro areas last year, including Seattle, San Francisco and San Jose, as well as New York, Washington, Los Angeles and Boston, according to research by Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. From 2015 to 2017, only nine metro areas increased their share of the nation's tech work force, including the West Coast tech hubs, as well as Austin and Denver. ""The tech industry concentrates in very few markets,"" said Amy Liu, director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. ""Our biggest concern is how do we make sure more cities, particularly midsized cities in the middle of the country, can be players in the tech economy?"" Amazon, which has about 45,000 people at its Seattle headquarters, has also opened 16 tech hubs in the United States. About 85 percent of those satellite employees are in six booming, highly educated urban areas — the Bay Area, Washington region, New York, Boston, Los Angeles and Austin. Each has at least 1,000 workers. (The bulk of Amazon's North American work force is made up of the more than 250,000 people who are dispersed in the company's roughly 110 warehouses around Canada and the United States and who make less money than their white-collar colleagues.) Apple, which has been criticized by President Trump for not creating more domestic jobs, said on Thursday that its plans for Austin included a new 133-acre campus that will initially have 5,000 workers in engineering, research and development, operations and other functions. It will ultimately be able to accommodate up to 15,000 workers. Apple already has about 6,000 workers in Austin. The company said it applied for a $25 million grant from Texas, payable over 15 years, as well as property-tax rebates from Williamson County. A person familiar with Apple's decision to expand outside Cupertino, Calif., where it just opened a new $5 billion headquarters, said the move into Austin was partly driven by the extreme housing prices in the Bay Area, as well as its aim to find more talent and add more diversity and military veterans to its work force. The company added that it also planned to open 1,000-worker operations in Seattle, San Diego, and Culver City, Calif., and to add hundreds of employees in Pittsburgh, Boston, New York and Boulder, Colo., over the next three years. Some economists said what was most remarkable was that it took the tech giants this long to aggressively expand beyond the West Coast. ""In a sense, what we're seeing is tech becoming a normal industry,"" Mr. Glaeser said, ""an industry that's not located in one incredibly expensive place."""
2,2018-12-13," The animosity directed at Amazon and the legislators who have opened the velvet rope to the city has been fomenting for weeks, but on Wednesday it reached peak rage. It was then that Amazon executives faced members of the City Council, a body that was locked out of the process of wooing the company here, as well as protesters whose numbers were large enough that the council chamber could not accommodate all of them. Both officials and civilians wanted to know why Amazon needed billions of dollars in subsidies when it had so much money, why it was getting a helipad, and how it imagined it could be considered a good neighbor when the city's public land use process had been bypassed. Ever since the announcement was made last month that Amazon had chosen Queens for its second headquarters over Detroit or Pittsburgh or anywhere else that would have welcomed it with far less ambivalence, the move has served as a projection screen for a wide and emotionally charged set of apprehensions about corporate tyranny, displacement, inequality, democracy, unfairness, loss. How much of the anger at Amazon and its enablers is justified? Those in favor of the deal have repeatedly argued that 25,000 new jobs in New York make all the compromises worth it. Even if unemployment in the metropolitan area is low, and the city has added tens of thousands of jobs in the technology sector in recent years, civic leaders, like hypochondriacs in perfectly good health, live in perpetual fear that those sorts of gains could easily evaporate. Since the beginning of time, it would seem, Republicans have played out that fear in rhetoric about tax policy, insisting that unless local tax rates were kept low, companies and jobs would flee to other states and cities. In New York, that has not proven to be true. But deteriorating infrastructure could emerge as the real threat to job growth and retention. These concerns are hardly irrational. In May, Alliance Bernstein, the prominent investment house, announced that it was moving its headquarters to Nashville. Although the firm would retain a presence in Manhattan, close to 1,000 jobs would be lost to a place that has evolved in the past decade as a nexus of urban cool. Like so many revitalized cities around the country, Nashville has great food, great design, great style. When Kathryn Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City, the business advocacy group founded in part by David Rockefeller in the 1970s, heard what was happening, she organized a meeting with the company and a group of political figures to try and better understand what had motivated Alliance Bernstein to relocate. Although there were several factors at play, the first grievance mentioned by the firm's representatives, Ms. Wylde said, was that New York had gotten tough to live in: a company survey revealed that average commuting times for employees were reaching the 90-minute mark. ""Then,'' she said, ""they listed all the other reasons."" Last year, as it happened, the Partnership set out to study the dozens of foreign companies in its membership, talking to them about the attractions and obstacles of operating in New York. The resulting report noted that ""in every interview conducted,"" the condition of airports, subways, roads and trains was cited as a major challenge. ""The number one reason companies chose not to expand in New York,"" Ms. Wylde told me, ""was the condition of transportation infrastructure."" This is not a small thing. Foreign companies currently employ close to 300,000 New Yorkers and contribute 11 percent of the city's total $761 billion economic output. In the mind of the chief executive, inconvenience is vanished profit. The delays stemming from the failures of the R train or the incapacitations of suburban rail lines is money gone to the winds. Two years ago, in anticipation of a New Jersey Transit strike, the Partnership calculated what lost time actually costs. Looking at all the data, it discovered that for every hour commuters are delayed, New York City employers would lose $5.9 million. The impact of catastrophic weather on ailing infrastructure amplifies these losses. Two years ago, Deanna Mulligan, the chief executive of Guardian Life Insurance, noted that the shutdown of the tunnels connecting New Jersey to the West Side of Manhattan for five days during Hurricane Sandy cost the company $40,000 an hour in lost wages and productivity. So when does New York, with its cramped spaces and soaring housing prices that force people farther and farther away from Manhattan, making them even more beholden to unreliable means of getting to work, stop being worth it? When do certain businesses say, Enough, and invest in the idea that talent is mobile, that good pizza, in the 21st century, can be found anywhere? Amazon's move to New York is a vote for the belief that the city, despite how generic it has come to seem in so many places, really is unlike anywhere else. Can that optimism survive?"

4,2018-12-13,"  [Want to get New York Today by email? Here's the sign-up.] It's Thursday. Get ready to vote on the Holland Tunnel decorations. Weather: Messy morning. Some wet snow and rain in the city till about noon, then plain rain, with a high of 38. Maybe a couple of inches of real snow north and west. Alternate-side parking: in effect until Christmas. Rewind: Mayor Bill de Blasio took office in 2014 promising to bring the police and communities closer together. Yesterday: He apologized because law enforcement personnel ripped a 1-year-old from his mother's arms at a government building in Brooklyn on Friday. The woman, Jazmine Headley, had been sitting on the floor of the Human Resources Administration building in Boerum Hill. She said she had waited four hours for service and that there were no seats. And whom did Mr. de Blasio blame? Not the police but the city officials who called them after Ms. Headley got into a dispute with a security guard. ""I want to issue a formal apology to Ms. Headley, and I'd be very happy to talk to her as well,"" Mr. de Blasio told reporters on Wednesday. ""By the time N.Y.P.D. arrived, this situation was already out of control."" Look ahead: The entire incident, captured on bystander videos, is under review. The chairman of the City Council's public safety committee wants the officers fired. ""If they didn't know to use common sense, you shouldn't be here,"" the councilman, Donovan Richards, told me. ""By allowing these individuals to stay, it sends the message that this behavior is O.K."" The Amazon executives who got grilled for three hours at a City Council hearing on Wednesday were jeered and booed by protesters but otherwise appeared undeterred in their goal of opening a headquarters in Long Island City, Queens, The Times's J. David Goodman reports. Why it matters: Compared with state officials, Amazon seems like a willing and open partner. A cynic might say the good-cop, bad-cop routine is well underway. The beloved children's show filmed in New York has brought back a character from the past to address the problem of homelessness, The Times's Nikita Stewart writes. Lily, a fuchsia Muppet with a mop of hair, green eyelids and a lavender nose, debuted on ""Sesame Street"" seven years ago and described how her family did not have enough food to eat. Lily returned on Wednesday. ""In the story line, her family is going back and forth between shelters, crashing with relatives and staying with Sofia, a real-life person who works at the local community center,"" Ms. Stewart writes. ""In New York City, where 'Sesame Street' is set, one out of every 10 students was homeless during the past school year."" Research: Sesame Workshop developed the scripts with help from experts on child homelessness, Ms. Stewart reports. The show also talked to homeless and formerly homeless parents in New York and Pennsylvania. Living along the High Line: ""Reliable stars, residents say, include a woman in the curtainless unit on West 23rd Street who regularly blow-dries her hair in the nude.""

Foreign companies currently employ close to 300,000 New Yorkers and contribute 11 percent of the city's total $761 billion economic output. In the mind of the chief executive, inconvenience is vanished profit. The delays stemming from the failures of the R train or the incapacitations of suburban rail lines is money gone to the winds. Two years ago, in anticipation of a New Jersey Transit strike, the Partnership calculated what lost time actually costs. Looking at all the data, it discovered that for every hour commuters are delayed, New York City employers would lose $5.9 million. The impact of catastrophic weather on ailing infrastructure amplifies these losses. Two years ago, Deanna Mulligan, the chief executive of Guardian Life Insurance, noted that the shutdown of the tunnels connecting New Jersey to the West Side of Manhattan for five days during Hurricane Sandy cost the company $40,000 an hour in lost wages and productivity. So when does New York, with its cramped spaces and soaring housing prices that force people farther and farther away from Manhattan, making them even more beholden to unreliable means of getting to work, stop being worth it? When do certain businesses say, Enough, and invest in the idea that talent is mobile, that good pizza, in the 21st century, can be found anywhere? Amazon's move to New York is a vote for the belief that the city, despite how generic it has come to seem in so many places, really is unlike anywhere else. Can that optimism survive?"

8,2018-12-13," The stock market often acts as though tech stocks were members of a close-knit family that must always travel together. Tech stocks, as a group, drove the stock market higher in the first part of 2018, and led the entire market lower this autumn, or so it is frequently said. I've lumped tech stocks together this way myself in describing market action recently and as far back as the early 2000s. Talking about tech as if it were a monolith isn't entirely wrong. Tech stocks often do move in a pack — mainly because investors frequently treat them as a cohesive entity. But when it comes to assessing what individual companies are really worth, treating tech stocks as a homogeneous group is a major mistake, says Aswath Damodaran, a New York University finance professor. It is a form of sloppy thinking that leads to wacky share valuations and an inefficient and vulnerable market. As he has written in his provocative blog, the differences between tech companies tend to be more important than the similarities. Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google were joined together under the acronym Faang when they accounted for much of the market's rise. But they are not remotely the same in organization, focus or business model, nor are older companies like Microsoft, IBM, Intel, HP and Cisco. ""What we call 'tech companies' really includes a broad range of companies that are at different stages of maturity,"" Professor Damodaran said in an interview. ""The aging process for tech companies — which usually start out as high-growth companies — is very rapid. ""Also, some companies are more tech at their core. Some are less tech,"" he added. ""We should be looking at companies along a kind of a spectrum, along at least two dimensions."" The problem, then, is twofold. ■ First, Professor Damodaran said, ""tech companies live in dog years."" They have accelerated life cycles and behave differently as children and mature adults. A young money-burning company like Tesla and an old cash-generating company like IBM need to be evaluated with different metrics. ■ Second, tech has become ubiquitous. ""Nearly all big companies today are tech companies, at least to some degree,"" he said. In late 2018, simply using advanced technology isn't a distinguishing characteristic. Even the newspaper industry — which used linotype machines and pneumatic tubes when I started as a copy boy in the 20th century — has a lot in common with tech companies. Like Netflix and Spotify, for example, The New York Times and The Washington Post use streaming technology and data analysis to feed information and entertainment to growing armies of digital subscribers. ""On the day that, say, 60 percent of profits and revenues come from digital sources, do we reclassify these companies as tech companies?"" Professor Damodaran asked. Similarly, he compared Tesla, which makes electric cars and is widely viewed as a tech company, with Ford and General Motors. Should Ford and G.M. be categorized as tech companies, too, when the bulk of their revenue eventually derives from electric vehicles? He is not suggesting that every company will need to be called a tech company. Perhaps none of them should. But, certainly, we should be more careful about describing — and valuing — those that now seem pre-eminently in the tech mold. Tesla and IBM are at two ends of what Professor Damodaran calls the tech company life cycle. As an infant company, Tesla poses a valuation challenge. Assessing the value of a stock typically starts with an assessment of earnings and cash flow, but that requires imagination with Tesla because it churns out annual losses, not earnings. Yet investors in the stock market collectively say Tesla is worth about $60 billion, more than G.M. or Ford, which make profits. Will Tesla become profitable enough to justify its current price? Professor Damodaran believes its shares are grossly overvalued. ""But it's hard to know with a young company,"" he conceded, adding that Tesla is ""a risky proposition but not an impossible one."" Old profitable companies like IBM are easier to value. The stock market says it is worth about $110 billion, based on a price-to-earnings ratio of 8.4. That ratio is less than half the level at which the average stock trades, presumably because IBM hasn't been growing rapidly and, by some metrics, has been shrinking. There is risk in buying these shares, too, but of a different sort. It's paramount for an older company to generate cash at a reasonable share price, and trying to ""reinvent a company like IBM"" — and shift it into a high-growth mode with big acquisitions like IBM's planned $34 billion purchase of Red Hat — could be a dangerous waste of cash, Professor Damodaran said. ""An old company can't run as fast as a young company can, and usually it shouldn't try,"" he said. There are exceptions, though. In Professor Damodaran's typology, Apple and Microsoft are ancient but have experienced rejuvenation, Microsoft most recently with the strategic turn to cloud computing taken by its chief executive, Satya Nadella. Apple had a second life with the return of Steve Jobs in 1997 and the subsequent births of the iPod and iPhone — though Apple is looking its age now, Professor Damodaran said. Both companies generate enormous amounts of cash, he said, and so can be valued with traditional stock analysis. Sober analysis is critical to market health. Consider the damage done by bouts of magical thinking about the value of tech stocks. In March 2000, for example, at the height of the dot-com bubble, the market gave Cisco Systems a value topping $500 billion, briefly making it the world's most valuable company. In a misjudgment of stupendous proportions, investors gave Cisco a greater value than 24 big companies combined — including Apple, Ford, J. P. Morgan, Anheuser-Busch, McDonald's, Staples and Texaco. What were people thinking? Apparently, that Cisco was worth an astronomical price-to-earnings ratio of 196.2 because it would grow at a breathtaking pace forever and become the beating heart of a transformed economy. That vision was revealed to be hallucinatory when the dot-com bubble burst. Today, Cisco trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of about 19.3. While valuations are generally more subdued today, imprecise thinking about tech stocks abides, with troubling implications. Amazon, for example, trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 109 — more than five times the valuation of the average stock. That has given its shareholders, including its founder, Jeff Bezos, astonishing wealth. It has allowed the company, which is old in tech years, to behave like an upstart, Professor Damodaran said, plowing profits into new businesses and disrupting entire industries. Investors have chosen to believe that, at some point, Amazon will raise prices sufficiently to reap big profits. Yet with higher prices, it could not constitute as much of a threat to competitors and might not grow rapidly. Like Tesla, Amazon's business model raises this question: Can the company ever earn enough to justify the share price it still commands? I asked the same question recently about Netflix, and could pose similar queries about other high-flying stocks. The answers should be different in each case, because tech stocks really aren't the same. One day, grouping them together is likely to seem quaint and, possibly, dangerous."
0,2018-12-14," [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] Not long after Google moved into the Chelsea neighborhood in Manhattan, its billionaire co-founder, Sergey Brin, went on a private tour of the old elevated freight line that would become the celebrated High Line. Mr. Brin looked over the barren landscape that would be filled with lush greenery and made a suggestion: How about a Frisbee golf course? That would not be a good idea, he was politely told during that walk in 2008. Frisbees would probably go flying off and strike people on the street below. It was the kind of small but telling lesson Google had time to learn. The company's slow expansion over two decades in New York City — from a single employee in 2000 to more than 7,000 today — gave the tech giant the chance to adapt its West Coast ideas to the confines of crowded New York City. The relatively quiet rise of Google could not be more different than the approach taken by Amazon, a corporate giant that led a nationwide search for new offices, pitting cities against one another in a kind of beauty contest. The hunt for a new outpost culminated last month with Long Island City, Queens, selected as one of two victors. Amazon plans to base at least 25,000 employees there, in return for as much as $3 billion in state and city incentives. ""They're running their own play and it's a very different play than ours,"" said William Floyd, the head of external affairs for Google in New York. ""We've been growing steadily for the past 18 years without heralding trumpets, or asking for support from the government. We've done it by the dint of our own work."" Google has also avoided the furor that has surrounded Amazon, which riled people by seeking to avoid public scrutiny over its move. Still, not all has gone smoothly. Some residents complain that Google's robust expansion in Chelsea keeps driving up the cost of housing, while small businesses say the company's free-food-at-work culture has taken money out of the pockets of local eateries. Others say Google has not opened up its wallet as much as it could. But in a city where almost any change is met by fierce resistance, Google has drawn relatively few complaints as it has made itself at home in Chelsea, a neighborhood where public housing projects sit beside luxury buildings, art galleries and trendy restaurants and clubs. Along the way, it has acquired a multibillion-dollar real estate portfolio, including two of the neighborhood's best-known buildings. Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker and a Chelsea resident, was unequivocal that Google has been ""a good neighbor."" In contrast, Amazon was not off to a good start, he said. ""This is how they want to be a neighbor in Long Island City?"" Mr. Johnson asked, referring to the lack of community input on the deal to bring the company to the neighborhood. An Amazon spokeswoman said the company was ""excited to learn more about the Long Island City community, to find out how we can best support residents."" The company has also hired high-powered lobbying firms to help contend with local political unrest. Google arrived in Chelsea in 2006 with no fanfare. Its real estate broker did not even identify the company at first when calling about space at 111 Eighth Avenue, a hulking building that covers a full city block and is larger than the Empire State Building. It once housed the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey but had emerged as a hub for telecommunications and media companies, including Lifetime Entertainment. Google made a statement simply by moving in. ""It said to the world: This is where technology meets cool,"" said Paul Pariser, the co-chief executive officer of Taconic Investment Partners, which owned and redeveloped the building and still manages it today. Smaller technology companies soon followed in Google's wake. ""There is a certain brand that comes with being in the area,"" said Mike Rudoy, 33, the chief executive of Jetty, an insurance start-up that moved to a nearby Chelsea building in 2017. ""It's less about customers and more about recruiting. It all comes down to recruiting."" These newcomers helped accelerate the gentrification sweeping Chelsea, especially after the High Line opened in 2009 and drew tourists and developers alike in what residents have called ""the High Line effect."" The median household income in Chelsea has soared to more than $104,000 in 2016 from $78,000 in 2000, according to an analysis of census data by Social Explorer, a research company. The neighborhood's 58,000 residents have become increasingly white and Asian. College graduates now outnumber those without a degree nearly three-to-one. The changes have divided residents of Chelsea, which had long been a hub of gay culture and night life. ""There's been a massive exodus of gay people from Chelsea,"" said Allen Roskoff, a resident and gay rights activist. ""What caused it? I don't know, but Google coming in there will further the need for luxury buildings. It will further gentrify the neighborhood."" Against this sometimes turbulent backdrop, Google was expanding rapidly. But some Chelsea residents said they did not notice until the company bought the entire Eighth Avenue building for more than $1.8 billion in 2010, and later hung its name in big white letters. (Some in the area still don't notice.) The company has gone on to open offices in three additional buildings as it doubles its size in New York City. This year, it spent about $2.4 billion to buy one of those buildings, Chelsea Market, an old Nabisco factory that has become a destination for artisanal food shops. Google is also leasing office space on Pier 57, a commercial hub on the Hudson River. As part of that move, Google said it would pay for the construction of a ferry dock for water taxis or a cross-Hudson ferry. Google workers have generally fit right in. They are typically young and educated and well paid. They favor jeans, shirt and no tie. They pack the Starbucks on the ground floor of the Eighth Avenue building. They browse at the T-Mobile store next door. The morning a new Android phone with a Google operating system was released, a Google employee was waiting by the door to snap up the first one, a T-mobile sales associate said. In recent years, Google's growing empire has started to attract the attention of its neighbors — some of whom point out that the company has not contributed as much as it could, given its extraordinary wealth and status. ""They would be much more welcome in this community if they would do their part,"" said Pamela Wolff, 83, a Chelsea resident who struggled to name a big-ticket Google project for the entire neighborhood. ""I think any business that comes in with such a huge footprint should be offering more."" Google's largess, for the most part, has been directed to specific groups and organizations. It outfitted a youth technology center with new laptops, smartboards and a music studio. Google employees have taught computer science in after-school and summer programs and have helped older immigrants learn to use Google translate. After the email system kept crashing at Hudson Guild, a nonprofit that offers social services, a Google team was dispatched to upgrade it for free. When the Guild needed a meeting place for its 175 employees, Google supplied an auditorium, as well as breakfast and lunch. It again lent space — and some glamour — for the Guild's ""friend-raiser"" for potential donors. ""Who doesn't want to go to the Google office?"" said Ken Jockers, the Guild's executive director. ""I think they are an engaged and thoughtful neighbor."" But though Google has been generous with its time and space, it has been less so with its money, according to Brad Hoylman, the local state senator. ""There's a sense in the local community that they could ramp up their giving,"" said Mr. Hoylman, a Democrat. ""Technology hasn't yet figured out that New York City is their home, too."" Google said it gave $150,000 in 2017 to Hudson Guild. In contrast, Pfizer, the pharmaceutical giant, which is planning to move into offices at Hudson Yards on the Far West Side of Manhattan, gave $500,000 to the nonprofit. Google has also given $1 million to build the High Line and another $1.5 million to a cultural preservation project for the Stonewall Inn, a West Village bar and a symbol of the gay rights movement. In addition, the company has provided free Wi-Fi across broad swathes of Chelsea, including inside the subway station below its offices. Increasingly, Google has sought to deepen its community ties, including to two housing projects with more than 4,500 residents. Darlene Waters, the tenant association president for the Elliott-Chelsea Houses, said a Google worker introduced himself this year at an art gallery and told her to call. ""Google and I, we're going to be close,"" Ms. Waters said. Local residents were invited into the Eighth Avenue building, which came across to some as a giant playground. Google workers whizzed through the halls on scooters with their own docking stations. There were Ping-Pong and pool tables, a rock-climbing wall and a virtual reality room with special glasses. Food pantries were stocked with chips, candy, soda and juice for the taking. Afterward, residents were treated to lunch in a company cafeteria at Chelsea Market, where servers doled out steak, salmon, salads and desserts. ""I felt kind of good because they don't do this for everybody, but they did it for the neighborhood,"" said Sam Rosedietcher, 64, a carpenter, who lives at the Fulton Houses. Miguel Acevedo, 58, the president of the Fulton Houses tenant association, said Google supplied 980 turkeys this Thanksgiving. Its workers donated more than 100 dresses and shoes in the spring during a prom-dress drive. He now brags that Google is next door. ""We have Google; you don't have Google,"" he said. ""Everybody uses Google one way or another."" But as Google has expanded, it has also replaced smaller companies, including some that have left the neighborhood. Workers from those companies are no longer around to support local restaurants and stores. And Google workers, supplied with free food and entertainment, have not taken their place. As a result, some businesses are not as enthusiastic about Google. ""I wish they had given a little consideration and support to the food vendors,"" said Howard Nourieli, a co-owner of Bowery Kitchen Supplies in Chelsea Market, who figured that his sandwich counter has lost thousands of dollars a month in sales. ""It would have been the right thing to do. Everyone's suffering here."" Some residents also worry that Google is taking over too much of their neighborhood. Its purchase of Chelsea Market comes with the right to build additional space on top, which residents said could block sunlight on part of the High Line. Ms. Wolff, a member of Save Chelsea, a preservation group, said she did not object when Google first came to Chelsea, but that now it needs to be ""watched like a hawk."" ""I'm afraid of any business that comes into Chelsea and grows exponentially,"" she said. ""I feel like we're going to be devoured."""

0,2018-12-16," SAN FRANCISCO — Silicon Valley technology firms are known for giving stock to their workers, a form of compensation that often helps employees feel invested in their companies. But tech workers are now starting to use those shares to turn the tables on their employers. As many tech employees take a more activist approach to how their innovations are being deployed and increasingly speak out on a range of issues, some are using the stock as a way to demand changes at their companies. At Amazon, more than a dozen employees who had received stock grants recently exercised their rights as shareholders. In late November and early December, they filed identical shareholder petitions asking the e-commerce giant to release a comprehensive plan addressing climate change. Their filing appears to be the first time that tech employees have led their own shareholder proposal, according to activist investors. In the proposal, which will be voted on at Amazon's annual shareholder meeting next spring, employees asked the company's board to say how it would respond to climate change and reduce its dependence on fossil fuels. ""We realized we could use our position as employees and our power and our rights as shareholders to bring visibility of this issue to the board and the top leaders of this company,"" said Eliza Pan, a program manager who has worked at Amazon for five years and is one of the employees who signed on to the proposal. Ms. Pan, who earned Amazon shares as part of her compensation package, said workers must own at least $2,000 in stock for a year to file a shareholder proposal. ""We had this power, and we wanted to leverage that power,"" she said. The move by Amazon's employees builds upon similar activism at Google this year. In March, its workers were part of a shareholder petition by Zevin Asset Management that sought to link executive compensation to diversity and inclusion goals. Google's employees did not directly file the proposal, but joined Zevin and presented it at the annual shareholder meeting of Alphabet, Google's parent company. The proposal was ultimately voted down, but Pat Miguel Tomaino, the director of socially responsible investing at Zevin, said the firm planned to work with Google employees to resubmit it for the 2019 shareholder meeting. ""Workers are looking at who holds power and where changes can be made,"" said Yana Calou, an engagement manager at Coworker.org, an organization that allows colleagues to start campaigns together. ""Workers are shareholders themselves, and risks to workers and users are often risks to shareholders, so there is a natural alliance of shared interests."" Amazon declined to comment on its employees' advocacy, but it said it was taking steps to address climate change. ""We have set a goal to power our global infrastructure with 100 percent renewable energy and are investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency innovations,"" said Kara Hurst, director of worldwide sustainability at Amazon. The company, based in Seattle, has installed solar energy systems at 25 of its fulfillment centers and has streamlined its packing process to reduce its use of packing materials, she added. Google declined to comment on its employees' participation in shareholder proposals. The moves are part of a broad activist stirring by tech workers this year. Employees at Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce and Google have publicly objected to who was buying their products and to how certain technologies — such as facial recognition and artificial intelligence — would be used. Last month, about 20,000 Google employees staged a walkout because the company had richly paid executives who had been credibly accused of sexual harassment, leading the company to apologize and end forced arbitration in such cases. Shareholder proposals have in the past been used largely by activist investment firms and others to advocate for changes. ""It's fairly unusual to see this, where employees are taking a stand in regard to the company they're working for,"" said Natasha Lamb, a managing partner at Arjuna Capital, a wealth-management fund that focuses on climate issues. Tech employees, more than in many other industries, have a ready-made way to become activist shareholders because of how they are paid. Google, Facebook, Apple and tech start-ups such as Airbnb have all made stock a component of compensation. At privately held companies, tech workers often get stock options, which give them the option to buy shares at a set price. Publicly traded companies tend to grant restricted stock options that automatically transfer shares to employees over a period of time. ""Because so much value is being created, or we hope is going to be created, it's appealing to employees to receive some potential part of that pop or growth in value,"" said Mary Russell, a lawyer and founder of Stock Option Counsel, a legal firm in Palo Alto, Calif., that advises tech employees on their compensation. ""The culture of the companies is that we need to do this to incentivize people to build the value of the company."" But by paying employees this way, tech companies open themselves up to this kind of shareholder advocacy, she said. ""They are setting themselves up to have quite a large group of stockholders who would of course, like any other stockholder, have the right to bring forward a shareholder proposal,"" Ms. Russell said. Employee shareholder proposals may ultimately not be effective since shareholder-led proposals are often shot down. And because tech founders often possess a large chunk of the shares in their companies — Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and its largest shareholder, owns 16 percent of the company; the Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have about 51 percent of voting shares in Alphabet — the proposals have little chance of passing without founder support. Tech employees said it was worth taking that risk. Shareholder proposals often gain attention because they are distributed to stockholders and are included in annual proxy statements, the employees say, and they give workers a way to raise their grievances directly to the board, rather than just to managers. ""Banding together with other shareholders amplifies my voice and makes all of our voices more powerful,"" said Ms. Pan of Amazon. At Amazon, white-collar employees previously brought up issues by speaking at companywide meetings or using internal petitions, while its warehouse workers have pursued labor organizing. In June, for example, employees petitioned the company to stop selling facial-recognition software to law enforcement agencies because they believed the technology should not be used for surveillance. The company has not stopped the practice. The climate change shareholder proposal grew out of discussions among employees who had noticed other tech companies unveiling plans to address it. Since 2016, for instance, Google has issued environmental reports about its response to climate change. ""It's important to make change and work for change wherever you happen to be, and I happen to be an employee at Amazon,"" said Emily Cunningham, a user experience designer who is backing the climate change proposal and who has received Amazon shares as part of her compensation. She said it was important for employees to publicly demand a plan. ""It's affecting the public, it's affecting business,"" she said."
0,2018-12-17," BLAINE, Wash. — This town near the border of Canada is home to only 5,500 residents, but it has about 20 mailbox stores — so many that the town recently banned new ones from being constructed along the main drag. The stores were built on their allure to Canadians, who save in shipping and customs costs by having their waders from L.L. Bean or mock Tiffany lamps from Amazon mailed to the stores, then carry the packages back over the border. But this year, the packages have slowed. The mailbox stores have quieted. And Canadians say politics and pride are keeping them away. ""For a lot of people, your president is not their favorite, and they've chosen to stay home instead,"" said Colleen Clark, 48, a Canadian who lives just 10 minutes from the border, and has stopped coming. ""The whole Trump idea — the building the wall, the this and the that. Canadians are a bit more open and inclusive, we're not into building walls."" Why did the Canadian cross the border? That's a complex calculation on America's northern edge from here in Blaine to the tip of Maine because the variables are always in flux, as currency exchange rates, online shopping trends — and now the uncertainties of international politics and national pride — filter into the mix. Rarely have things been so tense. Earlier this year, in the midst of a trade dispute, President Trump called Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, ""dishonest and weak,"" and threatened punitive action against Canada, one of the United States' biggest trading partners. Canadian shoppers have not forgotten, according to recent surveys in Canada and interviews with dozens of people on both sides of the border. And the stores of Blaine, only 30 miles from Canada's third-largest city, Vancouver, have felt the impact. ""We're not getting the packages that we usually do,"" said Denise Burrow, who has worked in the mailbox business for more than 20 years. Ms. Clark, for her part, said that hard-nosed economics was reason enough to stay home. She is the executive director of the chamber of commerce in Langley, British Columbia, and said the tense back and forth between the countries over tariffs and the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement have roiled the businesses she represents, which include dairy farmers and manufacturers. Her decision to stop coming to the United States was partly in solidarity with them. ""I wanted to put my money where my mouth is,"" she said. Recent surveys of Canadians suggest that such feelings run deep, concluding that shoppers intend to keep more of their money at home this year. A study by the Whatcom Council of Governments found that Canadians spent less time in the United States this year than they did five years ago, and of those who did travel there, fewer ventured much past the border. It was too early to know for sure whether the shifting mood was having a tangible effect on the economy of border towns in the northern United States, economists said. Overall, Washington State's economy has expanded with job and population growth, and some of the strongest growth has occurred north of Seattle, near the Canadian border. Any downturn in visits from Canadians would be muted by that. And the statistics on border crossings have been mixed — with some months up from 2017 and others down. The most recent figures available, for September, showed 32,000 fewer people in passenger vehicles entering the United States from Canada into Blaine, Wash., a 4.6 percent drop from the same month last year. But Michael LeBlanc, a senior retail adviser at the Retail Council of Canada, a trade group, said Mr. Trump had stirred Canadian pride. ""They were generally insulted by the tone,"" he said of Canadians, ""and it kind of put steel in their spines, 'Well, I'm just not going to shop in America.'"" Steve Hagen, who runs a mailbox store in Blaine, said he was closely watching every shift of mood for portents of what may come. At Hagen's of Blaine, which includes a play area for children who have crossed the border with their parents, Mr. Hagen said October business fell sharply. It picked up after Thanksgiving, though, so the overall picture still seemed unclear. What Canadians think about America as a whole can sometimes be distinct from what they feel about their closest American towns. In towns like Blaine, some Canadian customers live only a few blocks from the cluster of mailbox stores. (Regulations are part of the mix too: Depending on how long Canadians are in the United States and how much money they have spent, they are supposed to declare purchases from other places and pay Canadian taxes.) ""For Canadians, Whatcom County is a kind of near-abroad — it's seen as not quite American,"" Tom Roehl, a professor of international economics at Western Washington University in Bellingham, said of the county closest to the Canadian border, which includes Blaine. ""We kind of take advantage of that."" Shane Miller, a computer programmer from Canada who bought specialty Christmas decorations at Hagen's on a recent day, said he was traveling across the border less frequently. But he said there were products that cannot be found in Canada, or that carry such huge shipping and customs costs as to make him drive over. ""I'm not going to lie,"" said Mr. Miller, 45. ""A lot of Canadians, myself included, are not huge fans of the political status of the U.S. right now, but I don't let that stop me — though I might think twice about taking a long vacation down south or something."" Bargains can be alluring, too. ""I still like to shop a lot,"" said Tina Olexa, 54, a marketing trainer from Surrey, southeast of Vancouver. Ms. Olexa thinks all the bluster about pride and nationhood, on both sides of the border, may fade. ""There are people who say, ""Well, I'm not going to support the United States,' and I think, 'Well, how long is that going to last?'"" she said. Shannon Newson, who lives 30 minutes from the United States in the suburbs of Vancouver, is still coming. She said the Pacific Northwest still feels a little like Canada to her — fern-green and wet and not all that friendly to Mr. Trump either. Washington State went strongly for Hillary Clinton in 2016, and Whatcom County delivered one of her most lopsided majorities. ""If I lived somewhere where I had to go into a red state to shop, I might think differently,"" Ms. Newson said on a recent morning as she embarked on a two-day shopping trip in the United States."
1,2018-12-17," [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] In the rush to get to class, Eliza Harkins used to forget the things she needed most: notebooks, eyeglasses, phone charger and lunch. So Ms. Harkins teamed up with a classmate, Sarah Le Cam, to do something about it. They came up with a device that slips inside a bag, backpack or suitcase and keeps track of items using radio-frequency identification technology. If a wallet is not returned to the bag, the device sends a cellphone alert. If the cellphone is missing, the device beeps. The women are part of a new generation of technology whizzes emerging from Cornell Tech, a graduate school on Roosevelt Island in the East River that started with just seven students in 2013. Since then, Cornell Tech has become one of the most visible symbols of New York City's booming technology sector — and a major selling point in the bid to persuade Amazon to build a headquarters in Queens. Cornell Tech's dean and vice provost, Daniel Huttenlocher, sits on Amazon's board of directors, and Amazon executives visited the campus as part of the city's efforts to woo the company. Ferries provide direct service between the Cornell campus and Long Island City, Queens, where the company will build the headquarters. The school's graduates and researchers have parlayed their ideas, skills and ambition into more than 50 start-up companies that have raised a total of $60 million from investors and created about 200 jobs. One start-up, Nanit, sells a smart baby monitor online and in stores, while three others have been acquired by companies, including one by Adobe. So far, 534 of the school's graduates — of whom, more than 60 percent remain in the city — have been hired by Google, Bloomberg, Microsoft and other technology companies. ""It really sends a message to the broader tech industry and also the whole world that New York City is serious about tech,"" said Julie Samuels, executive director of Tech: NYC, a nonprofit industry group. Citywide, the technology industry employs more than 320,000 people, according to Tech: NYC. Many work in what Ms. Samuels calls an expanding ""ecosystem"" of more than 7,000 small start-up companies. New York's ascendance as a technology hub was reaffirmed by Google's announcement on Monday that it would create a $1 billion campus in the West Village that would allow the company to double the size of its 7,000 employee work force in the city. Cornell Tech is rooted in a 2010 competition among universities to open an engineering-and-science center on city-owned land. It was part of efforts by Michael R. Bloomberg, then the mayor, to diversify the city's economic base, which had traditionally relied on Wall Street and other finance jobs. Cornell University and its partner, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, won $100 million and a spot on Roosevelt Island. As the school has flourished, it has drawn criticism from some Cornell students, faculty members and others over its relationship with Technion. Some Roosevelt Island residents have also complained about the continuing campus construction, while others said Cornell Tech had not paid enough to support local neighborhood services, such as street cleaning and landscaping. ""They're a very prestigious institution that is free-riding off the backs of a working population to function in an environment that they really are not adequately paying for,"" said Joyce Short, a writer and longtime resident. All the money and attention showered on Cornell Tech has, at times, overshadowed other schools. New York University, which also took part in the 2010 competition, is creating a $380-million tech hub for emerging media, technology and the arts in the former headquarters of New York City Transit, then known as the New York City Transit Authority. Across the street, its Tandon School of Engineering runs several incubators for start-ups. Josh Hartmann, a former chief technology officer for Travelocity and Amplify who now teaches at Cornell Tech, said technology-focused schools are an integral part of what he called a ""virtuous cycle"" that drives the city's tech industry. The schools attract faculty members and support research, both of which draw more students. The students increase and diversify the talent pool, which in turn brings more companies. Cornell Tech's 340 students are enrolled in seven programs, from electrical and computer engineering to law, technology and entrepreneurship. By 2037, it is expected to have at least 1,800 students. It started in borrowed space at the Google building in Chelsea and moved last year to the first three buildings on its new campus. On a recent evening, students were huddled together in ""the collaboratory"" — Cornell Tech's version of a library with tables and smart boards. Downstairs, the school's ""studio_code:"" displayed seven principles for innovation, including ""Build Things That Matter"" and ""Don't Be a Jerk."" Every student is assigned to a team that works with more than 50 companies, including Amazon and Samsung, on real-life problems that begin with, ""How might we …"" Mr. Huttenlocher said that part of the challenge is learning to work together across different backgrounds, interests and programs. In the spring, students team up on their own to develop start-ups and then present them to parents, technology leaders and investors. Last May, four teams were chosen from dozens of entrants. Each team received a $100,000 award, including office space, to pursue its start-up. Ms. Harkins, 27, said their device — called a Kipit — resonated with anyone who has ever forgotten a passport and missed a flight, or failed to pack a clean baby diaper. ""It's stress in the day and it really shouldn't exist, it's so trivial,"" she said. ""There wasn't anything out there that really helped."" Ms. Le Cam, 24, who studied computer science, wrote the app for the device, which keeps track of every item marked by a chip-implanted sticker. The prototype started out shaped like an egg, but testers gave that a thumbs down because it would not fit in small bags. It was flattened, and took on a pocket shape. Another team is building a website to help people take care of older relatives by covering legal and financial planning, in-home care safety and timesaving services, such as meal deliveries. ""I did not expect to start my own company,"" said Darya Moldavskaya, 28, a co-founder of ReverCare. But Cornell Tech's entrepreneurial culture is contagious, she said. ""You're in an environment where everyone is thinking about it,"" Ms. Moldavskaya said. A separate program within Cornell Tech, the Jacobs Runway Startup Postdoctoral Program, offers funding, offices and training for academic researchers for up to three years — far longer than most incubators — to develop more complex technology. Sophie Zaaijer, 36, is working on a start-up, FIND Genomics, that provides software that compares DNA evidence from crime scenes to databases and registries for on-site identification within minutes. Neel Madhukar is a co-founder of a start-up, OneThree Biotech, that uses artificial intelligence software to analyze biological, chemical and clinical data to identify new drugs to treat diseases. Dr. Madhukar, 27, who has a doctorate in computational biology and medicine, said he had learned how to write a business plan, pitch to investors and hire employees. Cornell Tech's 30 faculty members include Deborah Estrin, an associate dean and director of the health technology program, who this year was awarded a prestigious MacArthur fellowship, which is known as a genius grant. Daniel D. Lee was hired away from the University of Pennsylvania with a joint appointment as professor of electrical and computer engineering at Cornell Tech and executive vice president for Samsung Research. The school's operating budget is $50 million annually and is covered partly through student tuition, which starts at $54,584 a year and increases to $102,652 for a master's in business administration. The school has also raised $815 million in private donations, including $350 million from Atlantic Philanthropies, whose founder is a Cornell graduate, and $100 million from Bloomberg Philanthropies. The school's technology lessons have spilled over to the neighborhood. Cornell Tech has supported computer science instruction at the public elementary and middle school. Its students have taught classes at a senior center on protecting against online fraud and created a web page featuring open spaces on the island for the gardening club. Jay Jacobson, 82, a retired lawyer who lives on Roosevelt Island, recently worked with Cornell Tech students to address a daily problem for older people: how to carry a shopping bag when holding onto a walker? They came up with a 3-D-printed hinge to attach to a walker. ""I'm so glad I'm part of their community,"" he said. ""It's just a delight to have them."""
0,2018-12-18," Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times.  For reporters covering Amazon, like myself, the company's search for a second headquarters, which it called HQ2, loomed over us for more than a year. The news, in theory, could have broken at any time, and 50,000 jobs were at stake, as were likely billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies. In November we finally learned that Amazon had chosen to split its ""second headquarters"" in two, between Long Island City in Queens and Arlington, Va., right outside Washington. Since then, it's been a whirlwind of public protests and quiet lobbying as the company and officials work to make their agreements a reality. To me, it's been fascinating: a blatant display of the company's power, good or bad depending on your perspective. That was especially apparent in an article I published last week, laying out what information cities and states gave Amazon about the work force, real estate and available tax incentives in their areas — and the value that information provides the company. It started late on Dec. 10, when the city gave J. David Goodman, my colleague on the Metro desk who's been covering the New York side of the process, a look at several key documents the city and state gave to Amazon to be considered for HQ2. The documents were going to be made public on a city website the next morning. Two of the files drew our attention in particular. One, from last year, was New York's first round bid, all glossy and making big promises. The second, from March, was the response to the long and confidential set of questions Amazon gave the 20 cities it had put on a short list. As we read through the documents, David and I quickly focused on the second, more detailed proposal and shot notes back and forth about what we saw. ""I think the questions are very interesting!"" I wrote to him. ""Like Amazon asked them for the price of goods at Whole Foods, WHICH IT OWNS???"" ""That's very funny,"" he wrote back. He pointed out the document showed that by March, Amazon was considering only two locations in New York City — Midtown West and Long Island City — and appeared to have dropped the areas around Brooklyn Tech and Lower Manhattan that the city and state had also proposed. The documents contained a few intriguing bits like that, but no bombshells. Much of the content felt very workaday. We decided not to write a breaking news story. The next day, I went back to the city's website to look at the document again, and the link to that particular file was gone. David asked the city what happened, and a spokeswoman told him it had been taken it down. The city should have checked with its academic partners before posting because the document included proprietary information. That piqued our interest — what secret information did Amazon get? Neither of us had downloaded the document initially (lesson learned!), but through my browser history, I could find the web address where the city had uploaded the file. And it still worked. While the city had removed a link to the document from its website, the document itself remained online. I quickly downloaded it and sent a copy to David for good measure. We talked about what to do with it and decided that while there may not have been news hidden in the details, perhaps the accumulation of data, some proprietary, that Amazon got from New York and other cities could be a story by itself. David had to cover the big City Council hearing on the project, so I took the lead from there. Reporting usually entails consulting a combination of documents and human sources, and this was no different. I had the document but felt I didn't have the expertise to fully understand its value, so I called Joe Parilla, a fellow at the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. He'd been following the HQ2 saga for more than a year and researches economic development. What was valuable? What was unique? We spent almost an hour going through it together. I'd point out a piece of data that caught my eye, and he'd explain if it was readily available or why it could be relevant to a project like HQ2. He kept scrolling down and declaring, ""Wow!"" I'd laugh and ask what he found so exciting. ""We are doing a project right now that, if we had access to Amazon's database, it would make our life so much easier,"" Joe told me. I interviewed some more people, including an Amazon spokesman who said the company has already used the information it got from the HQ2 process to inform other investment decisions. Providing this type of work force and real estate data to attract employers is exactly what local economic development agencies are designed to do, he argued. While the document did contain information that was proprietary, or at least rarely public, in particular around private universities, in the end it became clear that the greatest value for Amazon was that the city and state researched and compiled data from dozens of sources into one place. That even explained the original Whole Foods question — and why Amazon asked cities about the costs of avocados, milk and bread at one of its own subsidiaries, which surely it knows. ""It's like, why do the work,"" Joe said, ""when somebody else can do it?"" The next morning, I had a poem waiting in my inbox from the Times reader Tim Torkildson, a retired clown who's made habit of emailing limericks to reporters: The price of avocados is important to the schemes of Amazon big cheeses and their monetary dreams. And moo juice by the gallon is an algorithmic trend that corporations disregard at peril, my good friend. When whole wheat bread is pricey, then Millennials will wilt — and wash away forever like some tide-born murky silt. This is not footling research nor a whimsical pursuit; without this kind of data modern man is but a brute!"
0,2018-12-20," [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] As cities around the country made bids to land Amazon's second headquarters, lawmakers and residents were purposely left in the dark. Amazon required those involved in the process to sign nondisclosure agreements, leaving outsiders outraged when details of the deals were released only after they were finalized. Now, New York lawmakers are taking aim at this kind of secretive process. On Thursday, Councilman Brad Lander of Brooklyn will introduce legislation that would ban New York City from entering into nondisclosure agreements during negotiations for prospective development projects. A similar bill will be introduced in Albany by State Senator Michael N. Gianaris of Queens in the upcoming legislative session. The efforts comes amid a nationwide backlash against Amazon and its HQ2 sweepstakes, which critics said allowed the online retail behemoth to collect data from cities across the nation and resulted in economic development officials offering massive incentives without public debate. In New York, officials gave Amazon city and state tax incentives and a state grant that together is worth roughly $3 billion, and approval to skirt the city's land use review process. ""The process that Amazon required and that New York City acquiesced to forced cities to bid against one another in secret,"" Mr. Lander said. ""That helped Amazon maximize tax breaks and features for its own benefit, but it hid the public economic development policy from the public. And that is bad for transparency, bad for economic development, bad for all of the cities that participated and, I think, bad for democracy."" During the so-called HQ2 competition for a second headquarters, activists across the nation called for more transparency from Amazon and the cities that submitted bids. In places such as Chicago, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, city officials were pressured to reveal their bids. But that push for transparency has died down, said Nathan Jensen, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin who closely tracked the Amazon selection process. Now, even as New York contemplates banning nondisclosure agreements, Mr. Jensen said cities need to go further to fundamentally change the control that corporations have in economic development projects. For example, he thinks city councils should be able to vote on incentives a city might offer. Ultimately, Mr. Lander argued the federal government should take the lead. ""In the ideal world, there would be federal policy to push back against the kind of crony capitalism that too often passes for economic development. But since we're not going to get help from Washington, cities are going to have to do it for ourselves,"" he said. Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration pushed back against Mr. Lander's proposal, highlighting the benefits Amazon will bring to New York City. ""The city has secured thousands of good-paying jobs that will improve the lives of working families and give them security in a 21st-century economy,"" Jane Meyer, a spokeswoman for City Hall, said in a statement. ""We will review any proposed legislation, but we remain very confident we took the right approach, and that the process ahead will foster significant public input."" Mr. Lander and the two co-sponsors of the bill, Jumaane Williams and Jimmy Van Bramer, seem to have the initial support of the Council speaker, Corey Johnson, potentially setting up yet another confrontation between the City Council and Mr. de Blasio. ""I am deeply concerned about the use of NDAs in general and with the Amazon deal in particular, so I look forward to reviewing this bill as it moves through the legislative process,"" Mr. Johnson said in a statement. ""The public should have as much information as possible about these deals."" Companies, including Amazon, have often argued nondisclosure agreements are necessary to protect proprietary information. But, Mr. Gianaris said New York's Freedom of Information Law already protects that information. ""The idea that we allow private corporations to dictate what governments can and cannot share with the people they represent is offensive on many levels,"" he said. Mr. Lander's bill is also the latest effort by the City Council to strip power from the mayor at a time when many lawmakers have expressed their displeasure with not being involved in the discussions surrounding Amazon's move to Long Island City. ""I don't like that the city shielded its bid from the public,"" Mr. Lander said, adding that the bill was ""certainly motivated by a desire to prevent that from happening again."""
1,2018-12-20," [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] Alicia Glen, who became deputy mayor for housing at the start of Mayor Bill de Blasio's first term and was a lightning rod for some progressive critics of the administration, will depart City Hall next year, officials said Wednesday. A former Goldman Sachs executive, Ms. Glen had been in charge of economic development and major initiatives to expand and preserve affordable housing in New York City; she had a direct hand in the negotiations that secured a deal to bring Amazon to New York City. Ms. Glen also oversaw the city's troubled public housing system at a time when conditions worsened for residents and the New York City Housing Authority is under threat of a possible federal takeover. ""From building and protecting the most affordable housing in our history to growing our tech industry to knocking down barriers for women, Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen has opened doors for New Yorkers of every background and made our city a fairer place,"" Mr. de Blasio said on Twitter. Ms. Glen's departure follows several other recent personnel changes at City Hall. Two weeks ago, Mr. de Blasio said that his emergency management commissioner, Joseph Esposito, was leaving. Last November, Mr. de Blasio's first deputy mayor, Anthony E. Shorris, announced he was leaving the No. 2 spot at City Hall. Mr. de Blasio, who does not regularly meet with many city commissioners, has described his approach to management as a ""deputy mayor model"" and in that, Ms. Glen was the longest serving and most prominent. A replacement has not been named. ""Alicia had the tough job of executing on the mayor's housing and jobs priorities — things you can count,"" said Kathryn Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City, an influential business group. ""She has been tenacious, achieving ambitious numbers that lesser talents would have found impossible."" She amassed a record that included some of the most tangible changes to the city's physical landscape, such as the installation of a new city-subsidized ferry system and the financing of new affordable housing towers. She also appeared in glossy magazine features at a rate that seemed to rival Mr. de Blasio. Along the way, Ms. Glen, who lives in the same Upper West Side zipcode where she grew up, developed a reputation for making frank and occasionally unguarded comments. She alienated many of Mr. de Blasio's early progressive supporters, who saw her approach to housing as not meeting the needs of the poorest New Yorkers. Advocates have protested outside her apartment building. Alyssa Aguilera of Vocal-NY, a nonprofit that helps low-income people, said Ms. Glen represented ""a corporate and developer friendly mentality"" and criticized Mr. de Blasio for appointing her back in 2014. ""We thought we were getting this progressive mayor and she wasn't the change Mayor de Blasio promised,"" she said. Ms. Glen also drew the ire of the New York City Council for describing them in a deposition as ""not that smart."" Maritza Silva-Farrell, executive director of Align, a group focused on labor and income inequality, praised Ms. Glen for working to get more women involved in technology, but criticized her role in bringing Amazon to New York. The city and the state worked together to offer as much as $3 billion in incentives for the company. ""Her legacy is creating affordable housing that is not affordable,"" said Ms. Silva-Farrell. ""Her legacy is bringing Amazon and turning New York into another version of San Francisco."" The mayor's press secretary, Eric F. Phillips, said Ms. Glen, who turned 52 on Wednesday, had decided to depart on her own, and that she did not have another job lined up after she leaves City Hall. He said she would remain in the job for several months."

Cooke plays the outgoing antihero Becky Sharp, a social climber, with Claudia Jessie as Becky's more reserved best friend, Amelia Sedley. Michael Palin plays a version of Thackeray, who narrates the series. Cooke's performance is proudly contemporary, which brings an unexpected energy to this period piece. ""The way it was written by a lot of men is that women were very passive and apologetic, and tried to make themselves as small as possible,"" Cooke told the British newspaper The Independent earlier this year.

1,2018-12-21," SEATTLE — Olivia Zimmermann started her holiday shopping early this year, buying a Bluetooth speaker from Best Buy for her sister. It was supposed to arrive by Dec. 10, two weeks before Christmas. The speaker never showed up — and the post office said it had delivered the package to a different town. Best Buy apologized and offered to reship it. But Ms. Zimmermann, who works in marketing in Chicago, was over it. ""I just want a refund,"" she told the retailer, and then added: ""At this point, I have already ordered from Amazon because I know for a fact it will be here when they say it will."" Amazon is far and away the leader in e-commerce, outpacing competitors like Walmart, Target and eBay. But its dominance is never more pronounced than in the nail-biter last-minute sprint before Christmas. The company, based in Seattle, has had a two-decade-long obsession with shrinking the time from click to doorstep. It has built warehouses in more than 30 states and a sophisticated web of delivery methods, giving it a logistical advantage. Amazon has used that edge to lead people to expect near instant gratification that, for a while, only it could deliver. The company built trust in its delivery speed with its Prime membership, which costs $119 a year and includes two-day shipping. This year, in the days leading up to Christmas, Amazon's share of online sales will increase by almost 50 percent — to about half of all digital sales — while most rivals fade, according to the market research firm Rakuten Intelligence. ""Amazon's ability to fulfill more quickly and effectively than competitors has been a key differentiator back to the earliest days,"" said Kenneth Cassar, an analyst with Rakuten Intelligence, which is an independent subsidiary of the Japanese e-retailer Rakuten. Traditional retailers still enjoy strong sales when the holiday season begins around Thanksgiving. They advertise widely, luring shoppers with doorbuster deals. The promotions also drive sales to their websites instead of Amazon. Around Thanksgiving, Amazon's share of online sales can dip to as low as 20 percent in the United States, according to Rakuten. But as November turns to December, and then into Christmas crunchtime, shoppers' preferences change. Last year, Walmart and Target had their busiest online traffic of the month on Dec. 10. Amazon's was eight days later, on Dec. 18, according to an analysis by Griffin Carlborg, a researcher at the digital intelligence firm Gartner L2. ""Amazon has just built up its reputation around rapid fulfillment incredibly well,"" Mr. Carlborg said. ""Customers really trust Amazon's fulfillment offerings."" Those shoppers include Carissa Vinovskis, 26, who puts in 12-hour days researching diabetes at Children's Hospital Colorado. She used to shop for Christmas gifts in stores, but as she got busy with graduate school and later her job, she had less time and patience. Panic set in fast in the middle of this month when Ms. Vinovskis realized she had just six days to get presents before visiting her parents. She found a few cute things on Etsy — ""beautiful, handcrafted gifts,"" she said — and then realized they would take about four weeks to arrive. ""I was like, welp, Amazon Prime it is!"" she said. An Amazon spokeswoman pointed to a statement in which the vice president who runs Prime, Cem Sibay, said, ""We keep working to add faster and even more convenient delivery options."" Amazon's speedy delivery has been a key focus. In 2000, it invested $60 million in Kozmo, a New York start-up that delivered snacks, movies and other goods in less than an hour. About a year later, Kozmo shut down. But it remained an inspiration to Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and chief executive, according to a former Amazon employee who heard him discuss the matter. Mr. Bezos saw that quick delivery could change how people buy things. Price and selection have always been important in retailing, but delivery would surpass store location as another critical factor. In 2005, Amazon began offering free two-day shipping for Prime members, which Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates covers more than two-thirds of households in the United States. Almost a decade later, it started Prime Now, which delivers goods in as little as an hour in 30 cities. Amazon now has over 110 fulfillment centers in North America, more than 250,000 warehouse employees and dozens of its own planes. It is setting up warehouses that hold tens of millions of items closer to major cities, letting it offer free same-day and one-day shipping on more products. Walmart and others have also made strides in catching the wave of shoppers moving online by making similar delivery promises without the cost of a Prime membership. (In the third quarter, Walmart's online sales rose 43 percent over the previous year.) A Google search for the retailer on Wednesday returned ""Walmart Last Minute Gifts | Get 'em by Christmas | Free 2-Day Shipping"" for the name of the company's home page. These traditional retailers are leveraging their physical stores — a key advantage they have over Amazon — and providing ways for people to order online and pick up in person. That is particularly powerful in the final days before Christmas, when shoppers return to stores. ""The biggest area that we're playing offense right now is with our stores,"" Marc Lore, who runs Walmart's United States e-commerce business, told investors in October. For some Walmart purchases, customers don't need to leave their car to get their order — an employee will drop it into their trunk. Best Buy said more than 40 percent of its online revenue is from orders that are now picked up in stores. And on Christmas Eve, people can order products online from store inventory as late as 5 p.m. and pick them up just an hour later. Marshal Cohen, who advises retailers for the NPD Group, a market research firm, said three years ago, retailers rushed to match Amazon, offering free two-day shipping until just before Christmas — but didn't have their delivery partners sufficiently prepared for the rush. ""They just clogged the system so badly and really disappointed a lot of consumers,"" Mr. Cohen said. ""That memory was pretty strong in a lot of consumers' minds when it comes to thinking about shopping online."" Building the technology and infrastructure to quickly and consistently fill orders is not cheap, and after years of breakneck expansion, Amazon has squeezed more productivity out of its investments. It picks, packs and mails items out of its warehouses in a day or less, and packages arrive at a customer's doorstep about two days later, according Rakuten data. The data was based on electronic receipts and shipping notifications retailers sent to more than five million users who use Rakuten's consumer apps. Amazon is faster than every major competitor, though other retailers are speeding up. In 2016, Old Navy, which is owned by Gap, took about 10 days to deliver a package ordered during the week after Thanksgiving, Rakuten data shows. This year its packages showed up about three days faster. Walmart cut its delivery time from more than a week to six days over the same period. And Best Buy said 80 percent of its small packages now arrive in two days or under. (Rakuten's data excludes eBay and Etsy because the formats of their electronic receipts are harder to track.) Yet most retailers still have to work to win people's trust. Jessica Palazzo, who runs after-school programs near Hartford, Conn., bought her mother pajamas from Old Navy two years ago that were guaranteed to arrive before Christmas, but which didn't appear until January. Old Navy offered her 10 percent off her next order. This year on Black Friday, she put a pair of Gap pajamas into her online shopping cart — but then had a change of heart. ""That's embarrassing if you come on Christmas and have nothing for somebody,"" Ms. Palazzo said. She ended up buying running socks and a running ear warmer for her mother from Amazon."
2,2018-12-21," A new adaptation of the William Makepeace Thackeray novel ""Vanity Fair"" is on Amazon Prime. And a cast of big names is assembled in ""Life Itself."" VANITY FAIR on Amazon Prime. Olivia Cooke stars in this new British adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray's 1848 satire of British society. Cooke plays the outgoing antihero Becky Sharp, a social climber, with Claudia Jessie as Becky's more reserved best friend, Amelia Sedley. Michael Palin plays a version of Thackeray, who narrates the series. Cooke's performance is proudly contemporary, which brings an unexpected energy to this period piece. ""The way it was written by a lot of men is that women were very passive and apologetic, and tried to make themselves as small as possible,"" Cooke told the British newspaper The Independent earlier this year. ""And I just don't think that's true for every woman that lived in these times."" MARVEL'S RUNAWAYS on Hulu. Shortly after this Marvel adaptation by the writers and producers Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage (both of ""The O.C."" and ""Gossip Girl"") debuted last year, the two sat down for an interview with The Times to discuss the series. ""I think we've all woken up to the idea that just because there are people in our lives who are figures of authority, it doesn't mean they're definitely there to protect us,"" Schwartz said. That idea figures heavily into this series, in which a group of super-teenagers unite to save the world from their supervillain parents. Season 2 debuts Friday. LIFE ITSELF (2018) on Amazon Prime. You'd be hard pressed to find characters that encounter tragedies at a faster pace than the couples in this romantic drama, written and directed by the ""This Is Us"" creator Dan Fogelman. You'd also be hard pressed to find a starrier ensemble. Olivia Wilde, Oscar Isaac, Antonio Banderas, Mandy Patinkin and Annette Bening are all featured here, acting out the stories of a multigenerational and international group whose lives are connected through a single event. In his review for The New York Times, A.O. Scott said that there's a lot of good acting here — but that just about everything else leaves something to be desired. ""It is poignant and sometimes weirdly thrilling,"" Scott wrote, ""to watch Mr. Isaac, Ms. Wilde and the other cast members — I should also mention Laia Costa and Sergio Peris-Mencheta, though they might prefer that I didn't — commit with such fervor and seriousness to such utter balderdash."" 7 DAYS OUT on Netflix.

0,2018-12-26," The Indian government dealt a surprise blow on Wednesday to the e-commerce ambitions of Amazon and Walmart, effectively barring the American companies from selling products supplied by affiliated companies on their Indian shopping sites and from offering their customers special discounts or exclusive products. If strictly interpreted, the new policies could force significant changes in the India strategies of the retail giants. Amazon might have to stop competing with independent sellers and end its offerings of proprietary products like its Echo smart speakers in India, its top emerging market. For Walmart, which spent $16 billion this year to buy 77 percent of Flipkart, India's leading online retailer, the new rules could hamper its strategy of selling clothing and other products under its own private brands and prevent it from using its supply-chain expertise and clout with retailers to drive down prices for Indian consumers. Representatives for Amazon and Flipkart in India declined to comment on the new rules, saying the companies were still assessing them. The government posted the changes, which go into effect Feb. 1, without warning on Wednesday evening in New Delhi, while much of the business world in both countries was on vacation. ""Ultimately, the customer is going to suffer because Indian sellers are not at the scale where they can provide a good experience to customers,"" said Satish Meena, a senior forecaster in New Delhi for Forrester, a global technology research firm. ""This is a very regressive strategy by the government."" Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India initially courted foreign companies to invest more in the country after his 2014 election victory, but his administration has turned protectionist as  his party's re-election prospects have dimmed in recent months. Mr. Modi has increasingly sought to bolster Indian firms and curb foreign ones through new policies, including one that requires foreign companies like Visa, Mastercard and American Express to store all data about Indians on computers inside the country. The government has also declared its intention to impose tough new rules on the technology industry. The new e-commerce rules seemed to be an attempt by Mr. Modi to placate small traders, who have been hurt by his tax and financial policies, ahead of national elections next May, analysts said. The changes would also help Paytm, a local payments company that operates a digital mall, and Reliance Industries, an Indian conglomerate with online retail ambitions that is controlled by Mukesh Ambani, India's richest man and a political patron of Mr. Modi. Under Indian law, foreign-owned retailers were already barred from selling any products directly on their own e-commerce sites. In response, Amazon and Flipkart, which has long had foreign investors, set up partially owned affiliated companies to sell products like groceries, electronics and books on their sites. The arrangements gave them more control over customer service and allowed them to sell some products at prices below those offered by independent sellers. The new policies appear to close that loophole. They also prevent the online platforms from striking deals to sell products exclusively, which they frequently do now for hot items like new phone models. Salman Waris, a lawyer at TechLegis in New Delhi who specializes in international technology law, said the actual impact of the policy changes remained to be seen, because the language was vague and in some cases contradictory. Amazon, which operates through a maze of interrelated entities in India, has also been deft at finding ways to structure its operations to comply with the letter of the law while retaining maximum flexibility to run its business as it sees fit. Still, the new policy is set to drive up costs for Amazon and Walmart in India and may affirm many investors' fears that Walmart's costly acquisition of Flipkart was misguided. At the time of the deal in May, Walmart's chief executive, Doug McMillon, said India offered a unique opportunity for the retailer to tap into a young, growing and digitally savvy market. But analysts have been concerned about the amount of money Walmart will need to spend to help Flipkart grow and eventually become profitable. Amazon and its investors have long hoped the company could replicate its domestic success in fast-growing emerging markets like India, particularly as the growth of its core e-commerce business in the United States has slowed. The Seattle company has invested more than $7 billion in India, according to Morgan Stanley. After Prime and Alexa, India was the third most frequently mentioned term in Amazon's shareholder letters in the last few years, according to the research firm Gartner L2. Amazon's international operations lost about $2.4 billion over the past four quarters, although profit margins have improved."
0,2018-12-27," SÃO PAULO, Brazil — Its market value briefly surpassed $1 trillion. It has transformed online shopping. And it has had North American cities holding out billions to deliver its new outposts to their doors. Expansion south, into the nation where Amazon's namesake river ends, may prove a little harder. ""Amazon is still kind of irrelevant here,"" said Raul Prado, a vendor in the rural town of Guaipava, Brazil, who has relied on online retail sites to build up his business. Less than 1 percent of his sales are through Amazon. Brazil, home to more than 200 million people and the world's eighth-largest economy, is in many ways an obvious target for Amazon's next major expansion. Google and Facebook have done well in Brazil, but their digital services — search, social media and advertising — do not have to overcome the hurdles of selling goods and making deliveries. As a retail behemoth wading into the market, Amazon has found itself playing catch-up with local rivals that know how to navigate Brazil's distinct challenges: a complicated tax structure, high import costs and the headache of moving goods across a continent-size country. ""Brazil is really kind of the natural next country in terms of sheer size,"" said Cooper Smith, who was the director of Amazon research at Gartner L2, a business intelligence and research company, but has since left. ""It's a huge opportunity, and they are laying the groundwork for that today."" Next year, he said, ""Amazon is going to be all about Brazil."" His prediction came with a caveat: ""But it's no small undertaking."" Amazon has been present in Brazil's online retail market since 2012, but until recently it focused on selling books and its Kindle e-reader. A little over a year ago, Amazon made a splash when it expanded to let third-party brands sell electronics directly to consumers on its marketplace. Shares in local competitors tanked following the news, but they later rebounded when it became apparent that Amazon wasn't on the cusp of rolling out the services that have helped make it a market leader in the United States: first-party sales, by which brands supply Amazon with products and Amazon is the retailer; and its fulfillment service, which packages and ships products from the company's warehouses. ""Amazon arrived a little late to the game,"" said Marcel Motta, the Brazil director of the global research company Euromonitor International. Local, established companies, he said, ""know how to get around the obstacles."" MercadoLibre, for instance, the e-commerce leader that first began in Argentina and modeled itself after eBay, has been in Brazil for 19 years. ""We helped build e-commerce in this region,"" said Cristina Farjallat, the head of MercadoLibre's third-party marketplace. ""We have portfolios of sellers and portfolios of consumers that no one else has."" She said the company had lured more sellers to its site than any other online retailer by working with vendors to create the tools they need. MercadoLibre has a roster of 12 million vendors and its own fulfillment service, and is rolling out a payment service to bypass banks and credit cards. The company helped Mr. Prado, the vendor, turn a modest business venture — selling satellite antennas door-to-door in his remote village, where cellphone coverage was virtually nonexistent — into a national enterprise, with 20 employees. ""Honestly, I had no idea what I was doing when I started, but MercadoLibre is the first site people open when they go on the internet,"" he said. ""They have the brand name, their own payment plan, the logistics infrastructure and they even offer loans to sellers."" Mr. Prado, who created his company, Lojas Mineiras, in 2008, now offers his satellite and telephone products through nearly a dozen online retail sites. More than half of his sales are made through MercadoLibre. That doesn't mean it will stay that way. This year, Amazon broadened its catalog of products, offering sporting goods, fashion and home accessories, and signed up some major brands — but all remain independently sold and delivered. As of November, Amazon had just under 1 percent of the market share in Brazil, and was ranked 10th behind online retailers that offer both first- and third-party sales, according to Euromonitor's research. MercadoLibre had 19 percent of the market share. Experts say the window for Amazon to establish itself as a major player in Brazil is closing, which is why they expect the company to make a significant push in the next year. The question is whether it's too late. Mr. Smith said he had heard from industry sources, including investors, that Amazon had acquired a lease on a large warehouse outside São Paulo, Brazil's biggest city; advertised more than 100 jobs, many of them high level; and started negotiations to sell American brands on its Brazilian site. Amazon declined to comment. ""Jeff Bezos has always harped on the idea that as Amazon saturates the U.S. market, he can go to emerging markets around the globe,"" Mr. Smith said, referring to the company's chief executive. ""Clearly, it's coming. Amazon wants to have boots on the ground in Brazil."" But in some cases those expansions have been more challenging than anticipated — for instance, in India and China, where Amazon has struggled to compete with Alibaba, China's biggest online shopping company. On Wednesday, the Indian government dealt Amazon a blow when it barred American companies from selling products supplied by affiliated companies on their Indian shopping sites and from offering exclusive products. Amazon appears to be moving cautiously in Brazil: It has not had a new platform up and working in the country in time for the Christmas shopping season. ""Amazon wants all the pieces of its ecosystem in place first,"" Mr. Smith said. One of the major pieces is transportation. Brazil is larger than the continental United States, but its roads are poorly maintained and often flood during rainy season, and the state postal service is widely seen as inefficient and unreliable. Magazine Luiza, one of Brazil's top e-commerce companies, which began as a mom-and-pop store selling televisions, has said it had overcome these problems by leveraging its pre-existing and growing presence: It has 900 stores across the country. Those stores, which now sell appliances, electronics and furniture to working-class Brazilians, are being converted into mini-distribution centers for Magazine Luiza, and help educate shoppers about the ease of online retail. ""Physical stores are a fundamental part of our platform. We have succeeded in cutting delivery time and price,"" said Eduardo Galanternick, the executive director of e-commerce at Magazine Luiza. ""When you go deep into the interior of Brazil, Magazine Luiza is often the only department store around."" For example, thousands of rural families use the Magazine Luiza store in Grajaú, a city in northern Brazil's soybean country, to order appliances and pick up online orders like diapers and brand-name cosmetics. In addition to difficult competitors and terrain, Amazon will face thickets of regulation. Brazil's convoluted tax structure can make delivering goods across state borders a costly affair, while high import tariffs have priced many foreign-made goods out of reach for all but the wealthiest Brazilians. Nonetheless, the potential for growth — Brazil represents just 1.1 percent of global sales in online retail — is expected to attract major investments from Amazon and other companies. Euromonitor forecasts that the Brazilian market will nearly double over the next five years to $35 billion, and some competitors will be squeezed out as obstacles to online retail are eliminated. ""It's a question of Amazon conforming to our market,"" Mr. Prado said. ""Right now, they can't compete. But you never know. I'll keep offering my products on Amazon, just in case."""
1,2018-12-27," [What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] Even in Long Island City, Queens, one of the fastest-growing neighborhoods in New York City, 2018 was not exactly shaping up as a banner year for real estate. Heading into the traditionally slow winter season, condominium sales had slumped. But then in early November, news broke that Amazon would build a vast campus in the neighborhood and hire more than 25,000 employees. The deal has stirred political controversy and drawn mixed reaction from New Yorkers. But it has been greeted with euphoria among real estate brokers who have seen a sudden gold rush of interest in the local condo market. Some inquiries have come from Amazon employees, but since only a few hundred will arrive in 2019, most buyers have been investors and New Yorkers looking to relocate to a neighborhood on the rise. Asking prices jumped. Buyers rushed to make deals. Inactive listings turned into bidding wars. Brokers are taking bids via text message. And the rush has fueled concerns that a gentrifying neighborhood will become even less affordable, as ""tech bros"" push out the working class. The initial hype has leveled off, and with interest rates rising and signs of a recession, the market's ascent could come to a halt. But for now, while the rest of the city remains sluggish, the Amazon effect has changed the game in Long Island City real estate, as visits with three sleep-deprived brokers showed. Kayla Lee put on a hard hat and took a large work elevator to the roof of Corte, an eight-story condo building under construction where she is the sales director. She pointed to the nearby Citigroup Building, where Amazon has rented office space for the first wave of employees. A few blocks in the other direction was the future site of Amazon's headquarters on the East River, facing Manhattan. With Amazon's arrival, she said, the street below, 44th Drive, would become a ""golden road"" lined with shops and restaurants. The apartments Ms. Lee, a broker for Modern Spaces, shows at Corte are barely framed out and will not be habitable till next October. They range from $560,000 studios to penthouses selling for nearly $3 million. Since the Amazon news, Corte has raised prices about $30,000 per apartment; more increases are planned. The Amazon deal, Ms. Lee said, has boosted buyer confidence. Some buyers texted her offers moments after viewing units and are now in contracts to buy. One overseas buyer bid $2 million for an apartment without seeing it. When Ms. Lee took 30 minutes to respond, he raised his offer by $20,000. He is now in contract. Of the building's 85 units, 57 are under contract, with 35 having been bought after the Amazon deal. A handful of Amazon employees from Seattle have expressed interest, Ms. Lee said, adding that the number of daily showings had jumped from a half dozen to about 28. ""People want a slice of the pie,"" said Ms. Lee, 41, who led a potential buyer, Darren Floyd, 48, through a three-bedroom priced at $2.3 million. Mr. Floyd, who creates e-commerce start-ups and lives in Chelsea, said that moving to Long Island City would shorten his weekend trips to East Hampton and put him in an up-and-coming neighborhood. ""You can just kind of feel that things are moving,"" he said. ""You don't want to buy after the wave has come through."" Patrick W. Smith was bearing good news when he stepped into a spacious two-bedroom penthouse on the seventh floor of the Fifth Street Lofts, a couple of blocks from the future Amazon headquarters site. The apartment owner, Michael McGoldrick, had bought the condo for $848,000 nine years ago and recently decided to sell after upgrading it and purchasing a deeded parking space. His asking price was a million more — $1.85 million —but offers had fallen slightly short. Now, with a sturdier market, Mr. Smith, a broker with Stribling & Associates, was here to tell him that a buyer was willing to pay the asking price. Both men smiled and recalled speaking on the phone when the Amazon news was breaking. ""I said, 'Can you believe this?'"" Mr. McGoldrick, 54, recalled. Mr. McGoldrick, a commercial real estate lender, said he would weigh this latest offer. ""I'm not in a rush,"" he said, ""but I don't want to leave money on the table."" Mr. Smith, a longtime Long Island City resident and broker, puts out a weekly report for clients that includes weekly totals of all signed contracts reported in the neighborhood. Recent levels of buyer interest and sales have soared, he said. Before the Amazon announcement, there were fewer than five signed contracts per week in 2018, he said. But since the Amazon news, the figure has nearly doubled — and does not include many recent units that have gone into contract. ""We're the only neighborhood in New York that is a seller's market,"" said Mr. Smith, who has taken to categorizing local listings into separate tiers, based on proximity to the Amazon site. ""No one knows how long this will be the new normal,"" he said. He is working with an investor hoping to purchase 10 apartments. ""This has always been a growing and desirable neighborhood, but since the Amazon announcement, we've been catapulted by unprecedented national and international exposure."" Paris Hampton, a sales associate at Galerie, a 182-unit condo building across from the MoMA PS1 museum, smiled as a potential buyer, Ian Samlin, browsed the building's showroom. Mr. Samlin, 25, runs a money-lending firm in Manhattan and rents an apartment in Midtown Manhattan with friends, but the Amazon announcement prompted him to start looking across the East River. ""There's a buzz and people know what Long Island City is now,"" he said. The plush sales gallery that shows off the luxury amenities of the 11-story Galerie was inundated after the Amazon deal. ""The Amazon news hit and created a tsunami,"" Ms. Hampton said. ""We had to start doing group tours."" Galerie, too, is still under construction, so buyers have been bidding on units based on floor plans, Ms. Hampton said. ""People are excited to be part of a new neighborhood evolving in New York City,"" she said. About 50 units have been sold in the nearly seven weeks since the Amazon deal was announced, nearly equaling the roughly 55 sold in the building's first nine months on the market, said Ms. Hampton's boss, Vanessa Connelly, director of sales at HPDM, which handles marketing and sales for Galerie. After the Amazon announcement, Galerie filed with state officials to increase asking prices. One penthouse unit increased by $250,000, going from $2.5 million to $2.75 million, Ms. Connelly said. Gary Hirshfield, 57, an ophthalmologist from Queens who is also a client of Mr. Smith, counts himself lucky for having secured a three-bedroom penthouse in the building for $2.5 million before the Amazon announcement. He was back in the showroom to look at an adjacent studio for about $700,000, as a guest apartment. ""Now that Long Island City is more of a hot commodity,'' he said, ""I might grab it."""
2,2018-12-27," Until recent weeks, Skyline Tower, a 67-story condominium under construction in the Court Square area of Long Island City, Queens, hadn't drawn much interest from buyers. But its developers weren't too concerned since the building is only about seven stories high right now. But after Amazon announced last month that it would establish a HQ2 in Long Island City and would be renting space in the former Citicorp building right across from Skyline, the phones started to ring. There was one lone inquiry before the announcement, according to the brokerage firm Modern Spaces, which is handling sales of the building's 802 units. Now there are nearly 700 ready buyers. This is despite the fact that a teaser website went up just days ago; construction of a sales office only got underway last month; sales won't begun until March; and the building isn't expected to top out until the end of 2019. Although Amazon plans to build a sprawling campus along the East River, the company has already leased one million square feet in the Citicorp building, officially named One Court Square. Amazon has said it would begin moving workers in next year. ""Skyline Tower is 60 feet away,"" said Eric Benaim, the founder and chief executive of Modern Spaces. Skyline's site, on 44th Drive adjacent to the elevated subway line, was owned by Citigroup when the United Construction & Development Group and partners paid $143 million for it in 2015, according to William Xu, vice president of the company and the nephew of its founder and president, Jiashu Xu. The Queens developer, who immigrated from China in the late 1980s and in 1994 opened his first business, in plumbing supply, has mostly constructed low- and midrise buildings in Elmhurst, Flushing and Jamaica. The Court Square project, for which the developer also bought air rights from the CUNY School of Law next door, is in a different league. ""My uncle had a vision of doing a big, tall building to put Queens on the map on the condo scene,"" said the younger Mr. Xu. Skyline Tower will stand 778 feet tall and is poised to grab the Citicorp tower's mantle as the tallest building in Queens. It was designed by Hill West Architects as a curtain-wall building on a seven-story podium. That base will contain retail stores and the condo's many amenities, including a 75-foot-long skylit lap pool. A new entrance to the Court Square subway station, on which the developer is spending about $16 million, will also be at the base of the building. Apartments will range from studios to four-bedroom units — with one- and two-bedrooms predominating — and will be compact in size but have high-end finishes such as bronze fittings in kitchens and baths. Many west-facing units will have views of Manhattan, and some apartments will have private balconies or terraces.  The building, which is costing about $500 million to construct, was to have brought in $1 billion in apartment sales, a record sellout for a Queens project. But with the surge of interest, the developer — whose partners include Henry Yeung, Brian Pun of FSA Capital and Risland U.S. Holdings — secured permission from the state attorney general's office for price increases totaling about $80 million. One-bedrooms, which average 702 square feet, will start at $865,000, and two-bedrooms of 932 square feet will start at $1.225 million. The building is expected to be ready for its first move-ins the second quarter of 2021. ""We were excited about the building before, and now even more excited,"" Mr. Xu said.  Interest in Skyline Tower suggests that buyers have confidence that the Amazon deal is firmly in place even as local opposition to the retail giant's arrival is gaining traction. Opponents object to incentives from the state and city that could total $3 billion for one of the world's richest companies, the lack of public review of the deal, and the potential impact on Queens neighborhoods already feeling the pinch of gentrification. Interest has also extended to other new condo projects in the Court Square area, including Corte, an eight-story, 85-unit building; the Bond, a seven-story, 42-unit project; and Craftsmen Townhomes, eight four-story townhouses.  Modern Spaces, which specializes in real estate in Long Island City and Astoria, had been averaging eight or nine sales a week this year. But since the Amazon news, Mr. Benaim said, it has sold nearly 400 units, making the fourth quarter of 2018 its best in 10 years of business. Clearly, both the developer and the brokerage have found themselves in the right place at the right time. ""Never in our wildest dreams did we think Amazon would come to Queens, and Long Island City, and just down the block from us,"" Mr. Xu said. ""It's pretty surreal."""

0,2018-12-28," One of the best genre films of 1968 was among the very best commercial releases of 2018. Sergio Corbucci's ""The Great Silence"" escaped the vault and is available for streaming from Amazon Prime and Vudu. Corbucci (1927-90) may be Sergio Leone's only rival as the maestro of Italian westerns, and ""The Great Silence,"" which had its belated theatrical opening last spring, is arguably his masterpiece — stylized, subversive and superbly perverse, not least in its casting, mise-en-scène and Ennio Morricone's typically eccentric score. Morricone's occasional passages of raga rock notwithstanding, the world of ""The Great Silence"" is alpine. The frozen landscape not only recalls 1950s Hollywood ""northwesterns"" like ""The Far Country"" but the German ""mountain films"" of the 1920s and '30s. Everything is blanketed with a deep snow that, among other things, highlights the frequently spilled, bright-red blood. The sensibility is high '60s. Ostensibly set in Utah, the movie anticipates Robert Altman's ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"" (1971) both as a snowbound western and a western with a strong left-populist view: The law exists to protect the rich. [A.O. Scott's review of ""The Great Silence""] The white void in which much of the action unfolds can be variously read as a comment on frontier morality or as an existential landscape. There is also an absurdist element. Disenfranchised settlers, driven from their homes into banditry and the mountains, are the good guys; the rapacious bounty hunters sent to kill them on behalf of a malevolent banker are the capitalist villains, depositing their victims' corpses, for which they receive cash, in the snow — frozen assets for later retrieval. The movie's archetypically taciturn hero, played by the French actor Jean-Louis Trintignant between roles in ""A Man and a Woman"" (1966) and ""My Night at Maud's"" (1969), is totally silent — rendered mute in childhood when his vocal cords were slashed by mercenary marauders. Silence, as he is called, is a hired gun and potential liberator; the über-villain is a bounty hunter gleefully personified by Klaus Kinski camping it up beneath a priest's flat-brimmed saturno hat and a blond Beatle wig. From a distance, the two enemies are indistinguishable, lone horsemen plodding through the snow. A new sheriff (burly Frank Wolff, veteran of late 1950s drive-in cheapsters like ""Beast From Haunted Cave"") complicates the conflict, in part through his irrelevance. The bandit families, who sometimes suggest the ravenous extras in the original ""Night of the Living Dead,"" waylay the sheriff for his horse, which they plan to eat. Early on, there is a terrific scene in which the hired gun, the bounty hunter and the lawman are fellow travelers on the same cramped stagecoach, not fully aware of one another's identities. Affirming Trintignant's status as French cinema's prince of romance, the cast is rounded out with the fiery Vonetta McGee, in one of her first movies four years before ""Hammer"" and ""Blacula,"" both 1972, elevated her to blaxploitation stardom. Their impossible love, unusual not as interracial but for its tenderness and sexual heat, sets up for an ending so shockingly pessimistic that it has been said to have precluded the movie's American distribution and was changed for its second run in France. (The available version has the original ending.) A vocal spaghetti western aficionado, Quentin Tarantino paid homage to ""The Great Silence"" with his snowbound 2015 western ""The Hateful Eight."" Indeed, reviewing ""The Great Silence"" in The New York Times last spring, A.O. Scott wrote that ""in 2018, it's possible — and perhaps inevitable — to view 'The Great Silence' as a footnote to the oeuvre of Quentin Tarantino, whose admiration for Corbucci is well documented."" Be that as it may, Corbucci was inventing something new. He was a politically committed artist working in a popular form. ""The Great Silence,"" according to the filmmaker Alex Cox, an equally enthusiastic partisan of Italian westerns, was meant as a statement reflecting the despair Corbucci felt following the death of Che Guevara. A number of other Corbucci westerns, some originally released here under his American pseudonym Stanley Corbett, are available for streaming. Best known is his 1966 commercial breakthrough, ""Django"" (available on Amazon Prime and Vudu). Civilization in this enormously successful and exceedingly violent revenge saga is scarcely more than a muddy hellhole where life is less than cheap. Played by Franco Nero, Django makes a memorable entrance dragging his coffin behind him. His foes are rabid white nationalists, terrorizing Mexicans and riding around in flaming red Ku Klux Klan hoods; those in Corbucci's even more violent follow-up, ""The Hellbenders,"" also from 1966 (Amazon Prime), are a band of unreconstructed Confederates led by Joseph Cotton. ""Django"" not only gave its name to Tarantino's first western but spawned a score of sequels. None were directed by Corbucci who, in his third 1966 release ""Navajo Joe"" (Amazon Prime, Vudu) introduced another underdog hero, this one representing an oppressed race. Hair dyed black and slathered in man tan, the movie's eponymous star, Burt Reynolds, is a one-man gang of destruction, wreaking vengeance on the white scalp hunters who murdered his wife. The score is among Morricone's best, making use of tom-toms, banshee shrieks and the repeated chanting of the hero's name. ""The Mercenary"" (1968), a bigger budgeted production, replete with battle scenes and religious pageants, can be streamed from Amazon Prime. Set during the Mexican Revolution, it concerns a European mercenary known as ""The Pole"" (Franco Nero) who pragmatically switches sides, breaking with the corrupt government to work for a rebellious, if self-aggrandizing, peon (Tony Musante) and his ultraleft mistress (Giovanna Ralli). The Pole remains cynically detached from politics throughout; the movie's real villain is the murderous American dandy played by Jack Palance in a curly black hairpiece. Made during a period of Italian turmoil and even more overt in its insurrectionary attitude, Corbucci's 1970 ""Compañeros"" (Amazon Prime, Vudu, iTunes) brought back Nero as a Swedish arms dealer with Tomas Milian, dressed to resemble Che, taking the part of the seditious peasant. A gaggle of militant left-wing students added to the mix. Here, the villainous gringo (Palance again) has a pet eagle named America who feeds on the flesh of butchered Mexican peasants. With tropes like that, you might see the Tarantino oeuvre as a footnote to Corbucci's."
0,2018-12-31," LIMBURG, Belgium — Two years after Amazon completed its first delivery by commercial drone, the idea of routinely using unmanned devices to drop off items at front doors remains a distant, if not far-fetched, dream. The recent shutdown of London's Gatwick Airport, caused by sightings of drones near the runway, underscored the risks and complexities of the efforts. But as e-commerce continues to grow, drones have the potential to reduce the time, cost and energy needed for many everyday deliveries — assuming they are managed well and used safely. Before a commercial drone industry can thrive, particularly in the crowded urban areas of Europe, different kinds of drones must be able to fly along their delivery routes without crashing into one another — and under a standardized set of regulations, experts say — not unlike cars on the road. The path to proving that drones can operate together and be tracked in crowded skies has brought a group of companies to a former military airfield outside Brussels, where they will test their unmanned aviation technology. The project, known as Safir, will help the European authorities devise a set of rules for the commercial use of drones. Among the largest companies taking part is Amazon Prime Air, the retailing giant's drone unit. In December 2016, Amazon demonstrated how it might use drones when it documented the airborne delivery of a TV streaming device and a bag of popcorn to a customer in Cambridgeshire, England. Lately, the company has been developing an unmanned traffic management system — essentially, an air-traffic control system for drones. But Amazon's ambitions are just one part of the Safir initiative. ""It is about testing 10 drones with different purposes, applications and IT systems,"" said Mark Vanlook, the chief executive of DronePort, the recently opened facility where the tests will take place. The companies in the project fulfill a range of needs and purposes. Unifly, an aviation software company developing drone management systems, recently raised 14.6 million euros (about $16.7 million) from investors. Another company, Helicus, focuses on medical transport by drone, promising quicker delivery of critical medicine to hospitals. Both start-ups are based in Belgium. Other participants produce drones that can assist law enforcement, inspect power lines and monitor wildlife. The overall goal, Mr. Vanlook said, is making sure different drone systems can coexist while in flight. ""If drones can't account for their surroundings, they will collide — and hurt people,"" he said. The Safir project is happening at a transitional moment for the European Union's commercial drone industry. The European Parliament and Council just expanded the bloc's regulatory authority to include all civil drones, and the European Commission is completing a harmonized set of rules for drone use. The Gatwick shutdown, which affected the travel plans of more than 140,000 people days before the Christmas holiday, ""opened our eyes"" to the importance of the European Commission's regulatory work, Mr. Vanlook said, and the need for innovative solutions to drone traffic management. As an example, he pointed to Aveillant, a company in Safir based in Cambridge, England, that markets holographic radar technology designed to detect drone activity around airports, national borders and other critical areas. ""The technology to build a single drone obviously exists, and now we are playing catch-up with registration, tracking and rule making, all things that will prevent chaotic, ad hoc incidents like the one at Gatwick,"" said Ellen Malfliet, an official from Unifly. The commercial drone industry, while filled with unsolved hurdles and challenges, has attracted the attention of policymakers largely because of its economic potential. China is the world's largest manufacturer of commercial drones, while the United States is seeking to hasten the development of its own market. President Trump recently expanded opportunities for drone testing over populations, at night and beyond the line of sight. Major technology companies other than Amazon are devoting resources to the industry, such as Wing, a unit of Google's parent company, Alphabet, which has been testing drone deliveries outside Canberra, Australia. To keep up, the European Commission is helping to finance projects like Safir. Analysts say the commercial drone industry could produce more than 100,000 jobs within the European bloc by 2050. Countries in Europe have already been embarking on their own experiments with unmanned aviation, from fast-food deliveries in Iceland to those of critical medicine in Switzerland. By regulating all civil drones, the European authorities hope to create a uniform system that brings with it major investment, said Enrique Navarro, a professor and lawyer in Spain who specializes in aviation. ""The market is Chinese dominated right now,"" said Ulrike Franke, a policy fellow focused on drones at the European Council on Foreign Relations. ""And if Europe wants to catch up, it first has to unify its rules and regulations, which will incentivize European drone producers to engage not just with their country but the entire European market."" Members of Safir met in Brussels at the end of November for planning. In the coming year, the group will test products together at DronePort, which provides users with office space and outdoor testing areas, as well as a long runway, a control tower and hangars. They are also planning a live demonstration over Antwerp, Belgium, provided that they pass a series of safety and certification tests, said Robin Garrity, an air-traffic management specialist helping to oversee the project. Participants say the live demonstration, if successful, will send a signal to businesses and consumers alike that a vibrant commercial drone industry is achievable. ""Right now, we are at the cusp of an industry that is completely changing, with tons of opportunities,"" Ms. Malfliet said. ""It is vital to collaborate, to work together and move as quickly and as far as possible."""
